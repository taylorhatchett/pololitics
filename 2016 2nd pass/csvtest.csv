The competition in Iowa is so fierce, in fact, that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has leased a 48-bed dormitory from a Des Moines business college to house hundreds of volunteers. And I think it's safe to say, with RA Ted Cruz, that won't be the party dorm.",Seth Meyers,42374-7

1/7/16,"[Referring to President Obama's executive orders on guns] ""So, the President has gone through anger and way past bargaining, because yesterday he decided to go it alone, around the Congress, and issue a my-way-or-the-highway, balls-to-the-wall executive order 'clarifying existing laws' and 'noting that criminal penalties already exist for violating those laws.' Ka-boom! A fiery hailstorm of gentle reminders. It turns out, in this case, the President is less of a tyrannical overlord and more of an assistant lifeguard-in-chief.""",Stephen Colbert,42376-4
1/7/16,"At a rally in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders mocked Donald Trump for thinking that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese. So, at this point, most people are starting to feel like Trump is a hoax created by the Chinese.",Jimmy Fallon,42376-5

1/12/16,"Justin Bieber and his entourage were in Mexico [and were] reportedly asked to leave the Mayan ruins after Justin climbed to the top of an ancient pyramid and pulled his pants down to moon everyone.

1/12/16,"Things are looking up for Jeb Bush. No wait, they aren't. Things are looking down for Jeb Bush. A new Gallup poll [shows] Jeb Bush is the least-liked candidate among the Republican field. At least he's leading the field. Right? His name identification among voters is at 89 percent, which is very high. Which means people know who he [is], they just don't like him.

1/14/16,"Well, President Obama gave his final State of the Union address last night. It was the President's shortest State of the Union address, clocking in at 58:49. ...

1/14/16,"You know, these speeches aren't easy to make for a president. Half the audience is against you. The Democrats clap and the Republicans don't. Over and over again. If you're a Republican, you don't want to get caught agreeing with anything Obama says, because it could ruin your political career.

1/14/16,"At one point, while Obama was talking about the economy, Joe Biden leaned over to House Speaker Paul Ryan and whispered something that they both laughed about. Biden said it was a private joke between two statesmen, while Ryan said, 'He just whispered the word 'boobs.""",Jimmy Fallon,42383-8
1/14/16,"New polls found that Bernie Sanders is now ahead of Hillary Clinton among Democrats in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And even Hillary's lead in national polls is dwindling.

1/14/16,"Jeb Bush getting irritated these days, arguing with Trump. When asked if he would apologize to Donald Trump for calling him a jerk, Jeb Bush said, 'I don't apologize for it because he is a jerk.' Kind of reminds you of the great Lincoln-Douglas debates, doesn't it?",Conan O'Brien,42383-15
1/14/16,"Hillary Clinton bought a Powerball ticket, and she said if she wins, she'll use the money to fund her campaign. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton said if he wins, Hillary will never see him again.",Conan O'Brien,42383-16

In fact, their exact words were, 'As an outsider, I don't know if you'll survive.' But it turns out it wasn't true.

1/22/16,"Jeb Bush isn't so hot right now, but he's desperately trying to stir things up. He has a new ad in which he takes aim at Donald Trump. In the ad, Bush shows a vision of the future. It's Election Day in November. Donald Trump, in this ad, is the Republican nominee for president, and he's forced to concede defeat to Hillary Clinton.

Well, that's considerate at least. By the way, he said that at 5:45 am. This is what he woke up thinking. This was in his brain at 5:45 - you have to hand it to him, Trump insults more women by 6:00 am than most people do all year.",Jimmy Kimmel,42397-1

The Iowa Secretary of State said it misrepresents Iowa election law. Sarah Palin, who's a friend of Ted Cruz, said the mailers were offensive and shameful.

And the cover of the '[New York] Daily News' today was 'Dawn of the Brain Dead'. ? I think I know what is going on here. It is almost Valentine's Day, and the heart wants what it wants. America has been told for years to pick a sensible candidate, the responsible one, a buddy, a pal, great on paper. ?

He'll do.'",James Corden,42411-17

2/11/16,"Might sound a little far-fetched, but Kasich is actually a lot closer to being 'The Terminator' than any of the other candidates. Let's see how they stack up.

3/17/16,"The bad news for the leaders of both parties:both Clinton and Trump have a very high unfavorability ratings. Hillary is 53 percent unfavorable and Trump clocks in at an extraordinary 63 percent unfavorable, which I think, like, Jared from Subway has higher than that. This election is going to be the political equivalent of having lunch at Panda Express - nobody wins.",Jimmy Kimmel,42446-2
3/17/16,"A disappointing finish for Marco Rubio, who had ""fueled his campaign with all the fire and spontaneity of Vicki the robot from 'Small Wonder.'""",Jimmy Kimmel,42446-3

3/17/16,"To secure the nomination at the convention in Cleveland this summer, Kasich would have to get 116 percent of the remaining delegates. We'd have to make him governor of every remaining state, plus some states we don't even have yet.",Stephen Colbert,42446-5
3/17/16,"And if Ted Cruz is right, if every single anti-Trump voter unites behind him, he could get enough delegates to be the nominee. Then the GOP establishment can say, 'Goodbye, candidate we don't like. Hello, candidate we can't stand.'",Stephen Colbert,42446-6
3/17/16,"But if Cruz can't do it, there is one other way to deny Trump the nomination:a brokered convention. You see, when a candidate wins a primary, he wins delegates who are committed to him at the party convention, but only for the first ballot. So if Donald Trump doesn't get 1,237 delegates in the first round of voting, they're all free to vote for whoever. Great news. The Republican campaign could start all over again, only this time crammed into a week. So you can binge-watch the death of the GOP.",Stephen Colbert,42446-7
3/17/16,"Of course, last night we had a lot of presidential primaries and it was a huge night for Hillary Clinton, who won in five states. And afterwards she gave a speech and graciously thanked Bernie Sanders for the vigorous campaign he's waging, then said 'and losing.'",Jimmy Fallon,42446-8

3/17/16,"Donald Trump won every Republican state primary last night except for Ohio, which went to John Kasich. Trump didn't seem to mind since he said, as he put it, 'The word Ohio is full of zeros.'",Jimmy Fallon,42446-10
3/17/16,"The other big story from last night was that Marco Rubio pulled out of the race after losing the Florida primary to Trump by almost 20 points. But it still is a great story.

3/18/16,"Well, you guys, how about the election, huh? It keeps getting weirder. Looks like the GOP is headed toward a brokered convention, where the party bosses pick somebody other than Trump or Cruz. But who could it be? Jeb Bush's name has been mentioned, followed by loud sobbing and the words, 'Leave me alone' coming from the vicinity of Florida. ",Stephen Colbert,42447-1
3/18/16,"And there is an experienced party elder that everyone respects. It's John Boehner, who thinks we should make Paul Ryan do it. In fact, yesterday Boehner said, 'We don't have a nominee who can win a first ballot. I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.' Oh, John Boehner. Paul Ryan already got out of one sticky situation by agreeing to succeed you as Speaker of the House, when no one else wanted the job.

4/18/16,"On Thursday ""night, CNN hosted the ninth Democratic debate featuring Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

4/18/16,"Ted Cruz and his wife appeared in a town hall on CNN recently. And Ted Cruz's wife said that after they got back from their honeymoon, Ted bought 100 cans of Campbell's Chunky soup. But to be fair, I feel like anyone who has watched this election is probably stocking up on canned goods.",Jimmy Fallon,42478-5
4/18/16,"Cruz's daughters were also at the town hall. They said that if they end up in the White House, they want to have Taylor Swift over for dinner. Then Ted Cruz said, 'I hope she likes Chunky soup, because I have 200 cans in the living room.'",Jimmy Fallon,42478-6

4/20/16,It's interesting to see how many of the candidates in this particular primary have some kind of a home-field advantage. Bernie Sanders was born in Brooklyn. Donald Trump is from Queens. And Hillary Clinton is from wherever you need her to be from.,Jimmy Kimmel,42480-2
4/20/16,"Donald Trump had a bit of a stumble yesterday. You may have heard about this. He was giving a speech in Buffalo and accidentally referred to the devastating terrorist attacks of 7/11, instead of 9/11.

None of the choices are good, but you have to eat something, right?",Jimmy Kimmel,42480-4
4/20/16,"Of course, on the Republican side, Donald Trump is heavily favored to win tonight's primary. New York is his home town, and he's been married to many of its voters.",Stephen Colbert,42480-5
4/20/16,"But Trump's victory may not be enough to avoid a contested convention. That is where no candidate has no majority of delegates, freeing up those delegates to vote for anyone they think would be most appealing to the American public. So the next GOP presidential nominee could be a 'Gilmore Girls' reboot.",Stephen Colbert,42480-6

New Yorkers haven't seen a thrashing this bad since any Knicks game.",Stephen Colbert,42481-5
4/21/16,"On the Democratic side, it was a tough choice for New Yorkers. You go to the polls, you see old ladies working there, you want to make them happy, but you don't know. Have they been waiting their whole lives for a woman president, or are they friends with Bernie from aqua-aerobics?",Stephen Colbert,42481-6
4/21/16,"Of course, the clearest message coming out of New York last night was, 'Suck it, Ted Cruz. Suck our New York values.' Because Cruz got just 15 percent of the vote, and in one county, he even lost to Ben Carson, who dropped out of the race a month ago. Though, to be fair, Dr. Carson may not be aware that he dropped out of the race.",Stephen Colbert,42481-7
4/21/16,"For Trump, of course, last night was total domination. He won 60 percent of the vote, taking every district except one, Manhattan, which went to Gov. John Kasich. After picking up 90 delegates, Trump has his sights set on the Republican Convention in Cleveland. ? But this is likely going to be a contested convention, where if no one wins the first round of voting, delegates can switch their votes to any other candidate they want. And it is not against the rules to woo these delegates with any gifts, including money or jobs or the most precious prize of all:A ticket out of Cleveland.",Stephen Colbert,42481-8
4/22/16,"Well, if you're following the news you know that the 2016 Republican primary toboggan ride is rapidly approaching the oak tree of their summer convention, and if you think that you're worried about what is going to happen in this race, just consider Reince Priebus, RNC chairman and man whose name is an anagram for Crisp Bee Urine. ",Stephen Colbert,42482-1
4/22/16,"Reince is in a really tough spot right now. As his party approaches a contested convention, it appears to be going up in flames. As he told reporters yesterday, 'Sometimes you can't fix it. Sometimes you can just take a seven-alarm fire and make it a four-alarm fire. It's still burning but not as bad as it was.' Okay, okay, very happy. Not as bad as it was, Reince.

4/26/16,"John Kasich and Ted Cruz have formed a 'Game of Thrones'-like alliance to stop Trump. The plan is to coordinate which states they compete in.
