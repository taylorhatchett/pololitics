<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good to see everybody. You know, it is good to be back. We were off for Christmas and apparently so was the Department of Homeland Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about that kid that tried to blow up the plane on Christmas Day with a bomb he had hidden in his underwear. Before he could get the bomb lit, some hero passengers grabbed him. They dragged him into first class. See, I had no idea that's how you got upgraded on Delta. I thought it was a point system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He tried to detonate the bomb in his underwear. Fortunately, it didn't go off and his underpants just caught fire. ... Al Qaeda calls that...'a wardrobe malfunction.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After it was announced that Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry may go to Iran, the mullahs denied him an entry visa. ... See, that's how international travel works. If your name is Senator John Kerry and you're a former candidate for President of the United States, your travel is limited. If your name is Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, you stow a bomb in your underpants, you pay cash for a one-way ticket after your father called the embassy and said, 'My kid is an idiot,' ooh, you can go anywhere you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh is okay after being released from a Hawaiian hospital after a heart scare. ... Fox News sent flowers, MSNBC sent cheese fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, no one knows...what caused Rush Limbaugh's chest pains. But if you're Rush Limbaugh, it could've been a number of things. I mean, the economy's getting better, the healthcare bill is going to pass; the Republicans are having trouble raising money. It could be any one of those things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists now say that...within 40 years robots will be doing most of the jobs we don't want to do, especially illegal robots from Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The global warming conference has been cancelled. Right. We don't need it. You see, because it's so damn cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this...23-year-old kid from Nigeria? Goes to Yemen and he's flying to Detroit and he wants to blow the plane up. He sets his underpants on fire. And thank God the passengers on the plane subdue the guy. They secure him, they tie him up and they move him to first class. ... Are we sending the right message there, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people everywhere are pointing fingers about security. They're saying, 'Well, you know, you should have done this and you should have done that and you should have done this.' And I'm telling you, this guy paid cash for his ticket for a flight to Detroit. Now you tell me -- what is the bigger red flag in this economy? The fact that somebody had cash, or they wanted to go to Detroit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. Isn't it about time we had a little good news? Our good friend Regis Philbin had hip replacement surgery. He's back on the job. ... That means only ten million unemployed people to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about this? Rush Limbaugh, there's a big boy. He...was also in the hospital. He said he had chest pains and I thought, oh he is just trying to get some of those painkillers. That's what he is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's how it works. Here's the official line of succession in control of the Republican Party. If Rush Limbaugh is disabled in any way, then control of the party is passed to Glenn Beck. That's the line of succession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's back from vacation today. In Washington, President Obama returned to the Oval Office after spending the holidays in Hawaii. And Joe Biden returned after spending the holidays on his home planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you go and see the 'Avatar' movie? ... The 3-D blockbuster has now made one billion dollars. Today, the auto industry issued a statement. They'd like to remind people that all their cars are in 3-D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama took his daughters to see the 3- D version of 'Avatar.' ... There was an awkward moment when one of Obama's daughters leaned over to him and whispered, 'Now, that's how you spend half a billion dollars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has everybody here seen 'Avatar'? Great movie, wasn't it? ... Even President Obama took his family to see it at a private screening in Hawaii. After the movie, Obama was like, 'So that's what it's like when something lives up to its hype.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear this? Rush Limbaugh was released from a hospital in Hawaii two days after suffering from chest pains. He's fine. Doctors say they don't know what caused it but it may have something to do with being an overweight man whose job is being enraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do hope you guys had a restful holiday. How could you not, with news like this? 'An al Qaeda plot to blow up a US airliner on Christmas Day.' Have yourself a merry little -- ahhh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, the industrious souls of elf Qaeda trying to spread a little Christmas fear throughout the land but this terror plot didn't come from their workshop at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. 'The bomb was built and the plot organized by al Qaeda leaders in the country of Yemen.' Yes! We got us a new front in the war on terror!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what did the al Qaeda masterminds of 'Terror 2.0' cook up? 'Federal investigators say the man accused of the attempted bombing...hid a powerful explosive powder in specially made underwear.' ... Now, whenever there's an incident like this, the question is always, could we have seen it coming? But in this case, a Nigerian guy from Yemen with Doomsday underpants. That seems to come out of nowhere. 'As early as August of 2009, the Central Intelligence Agency was picking up information on a person of interest dubbed 'The Nigerian.' 'The suspect already on a US terror watch list.' 'Put there after his father -- a Nigerian banker -- told the US five weeks ago that he was worried his son was becoming radicalized.' Okay, um, all right. I too have a tendency to ignore messages from Nigerian bankers who wish to help me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when they show up in person and aren't asking for a money order but instead turning in their own son, maybe that conversation doesn't get filed under spam. 'His visa had been yanked by the British. He...paid cash for his ticket. It was a one-way ticket.' 'He paid nearly $3,000 in cash for his plane ticket and checked no bags.' ... It's December! He's going from Nigeria to Amsterdam to Detroit, without a coat? With a one-way ticket. Oh, do you think he's going to Detroit to start a better life? What, do you think he's going there because he heard there's lots of jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the national security system failed. Luckily, the knee-jerk partisan blame system was in perfect working order. 'The President waits 72 hours before we hear from him. ... And it's over 72 hours from the time of the incident to the time that the President spoke today.' Unbelievable: 72 hours! The time it took President Obama to talk about this. Jack Bauer could have caught the terrorist three times in that period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was different when old Karl Rove's boss was in charge and some other guy ? Richard Reid ? tried to blow up that plane. Bush got right out there and talked about it after only, six days, which is much less than 72.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I don't know about you, but this Christmas, my flight home was rough, mostly because I walked. You see, like you, I was terrified by the attempted bombing of Delta flight 253 on Christmas Day. But what really filled my pants with figgy pudding was that the alleged bomber...had the explosives 'sewn into' his underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The weather here in California is very nice. But it's freezing all across the United States. ... In fact, in DC, the weather is so bad -- this is true -- they actually...hired convicted criminals to shovel snow at the US Capitol. Isn't that amazing? So it's nice to see members of Congress doing something useful for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news ? you know the...Nigerian underwear bomber? He is now in custody. Remember the good old days when the only threat from Nigeria was spam email? ... From the prince. He had a thousand dollars. What happened?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, a lot of people complaining that...traveling here in the United States is a pain; we shouldn't have to go through a pat-down search. You think you should? Yeah, I mean, hey, when you go to a football stadium, they pat you down, right, huh? I mean, shouldn't the country be as least as hard to get into as a Cleveland Browns game? Don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bush says he's been following the situation in Yemen very carefully. But, you know, we love President Bush, but I don't think he really understands the situation. Like today, President Bush said, 'When life gives you Yemens, you make Yemenade.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government investigated yet another terrorist threat today. Luckily...it was just McDonald's announcing they're bringing back the McRib sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the McRib is coming back. That's why Rush Limbaugh was rushed to the hospital. ... I knew there was something going on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the doctor who examined Rush Limbaugh says that he's fine, back to normal. That's good to know. You know, they asked about every possible problem they could think of, and when Rush blamed every one of them on Barack Obama, they knew, 'Oh, he's just fine. Back to normal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday morning in Helsinki, Finland, a train...crashed into a Holiday Inn. ... Here's the odd part. It was an Amtrak train from Connecticut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Already Having A Bad Year: &quot;10. Your underpants keep exploding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Already Having A Bad Year: &quot;8. You're the nurse who had to give Rush Limbaugh a sponge bath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold. Am I right? ... You know, Rush Limbaugh was...ill. And he had to go to the hospital. He had chest pains but he's completely recovered. He'll be back on his job on Wednesday, which is great because the country really can use some hot air now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember they had the big state dinner for the Prime Minister of India and a couple of people who weren't invited show up, the Salahis? ... And now it turns out there was a third person who was not invited that showed up at the state dinner. I mean, it's a little crazy. I mean, before that, the only person I knew who showed up at the White House without the proper credentials was George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the thing that's still bothering people ? there's a flight, it originates overseas, they make a stop in Amsterdam and then they come to Detroit and there's a guy on the plane over Detroit and he's wearing exploding underpants and he tries to blow up the plane. Exploding underpants. That's...what it's come to, ladies and gentlemen. Exploding...underpants. Do you remember the old Road Runner cartoons? Isn't that something you could get from Acme? Couldn't you get the big crate and there'd be the exploding underpants?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll asked Americans who their ideal next-door neighbor would be. The number one answer was the Obama family...mainly because the Obamas are the kind of neighbors who would lend you a cup of sugar or a trillion dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has appointed a transgender woman to a position in the Department of Commerce. .. You know, in this era of partisan bickering, President Obama deserves a lot of credit for taking a chance on Ann Coulter, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now been reported that Britain...did pass information on to US authorities about the attempted underwear bomber, but the US disregarded it. ... In part, that's because the British intelligence referred to him as 'a bloke with boomzy-woomzy in his knickers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama spent the day talking to officials about airline security. One of the things they are doing is adding dozens of names to the no-fly list. Uh, hello, have you tried flying out of Newark? We're all on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys hear about this? The Secret Service just discovered that a third uninvited guest got into Obama's state dinner back in November, although Joe Biden insists he was actually invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading today that President Obama has started updating the Oval Office to reflect his personality, which basically just means he took down President Bush's autographed cast photo from the 'Dukes of Hazzard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow at the White House, President Obama is going to recognize a group of teachers for their award-winning work in teaching math and science. Obama said he's looking forward to it, because he always likes meeting people from China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of states are faced subzero temperatures this week. Everyone's taking precautions. In fact, airports are on the lookout for thermal underwear bombers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the guy that blew up his underpants? People are mad about that. I think it's funny. I don't know. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. You would never guess he'd be mixed up in something like this. Not Abdulmutallab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately his bomb didn't work how he wanted. He was tackled by a Dutch filmmaker, which, that had to be embarrassing. Tackled by a Dutch filmmaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And conservatives have been criticizing President Obama. I guess they figure with ears like that he should have overheard something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, after the shoe bomber, they made us take off our shoes. Now, this underwear thing, could be a real problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder if mothers of terrorists tell their kids to wear clean underwear in case something great happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk now we may have to go through these full body scanners, which would allow TSA screeners to see us, not exactly naked, but...close enough that every time Salma Hayek goes to the airport, there's going to be a line of guys in blue polyester blazers running to their posts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, as you know, it's been more than eight years since the attacks of 9/11 permanently scared our country. But in that time, I take solace in the fact that our leaders over these past eight years have almost now completed the process of figuring out what to name the as yet undesigned, unbuilt structure that will ultimately occupy the steel barren area at ground zero. But of course, these...things take time, which is why this little story out of Dubai caught my interest. 'Well, a big celebration in Dubai. The world's tallest building being inaugurated.' ... Must have taken them decades to build it. 'The Burj, by the way, began ? the building for it, the construction, began back in 2004.' Gyyyaaaaahhhh!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Mitt Romney was on 'Fox and Friends.' He talked about his plan to run for president in 2012. It could be Mitt Romney versus Sarah Palin, which would be quite a matchup. I mean, one is a former governor obsessed with looks and hair. And the other, of course, is from Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The annual list of the most admired men in the world came out today. Bill Clinton and Tiger Woods are tied. ... I wonder what those two would have in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody make New Year's resolutions? ... I have to find something to do. ... I'm going to crash a White House state dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading a book about Osama bin Laden, and it was written by his son, and according to the son, in the book about his father, the kid claims Osama bin Laden was a cruel parent. Gosh, you think you know somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the book is written by bin Laden's dumb son, Osama W. bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama honored more than 80 teachers for excellence in math and science. ... Then he begged them to leave China and come teach here in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to President Obama on becoming an uncle. His brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, and his wife just had a son in Oregon. Or so they claim. Lou Dobbs is demanding to see the birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The child's name is Austin Robinson. Next week, he'll go before the Senate and if they confirm him, he becomes the official nephew of President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have an interesting tradition in the Obama family. Every new baby born into the Obama family is baptized by Oprah in a 24 karat gold tub full of angel tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that the Yemen thing complicates the war on terror, but on the plus side, getting attacked is really the only way we Americans learn about world geography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am still reeling from the Christmas attack on America, when the Senate passed the healthcare bill. Way to ruin Christmas, Dems!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heaviest snowfall in over 60 years has been recorded in Beijing, China. In fact, there was so much snow on the streets; a lot of 6-year-old kids couldn't get to their factory jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yeah, I'm way out of line there. ...You all wear the sneakers. You just don't care where they're made, but okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we're learning more and more about the country of Yemen. That's where that underwear bomber kid was trained. It turns out it has one of the world's highest birthrates. Every woman there has at least six children. Unbelievable, yeah. And listen, they manage to do that without even having an NBA team. Okay, so that's pretty...amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Connecticut Senator -- Democratic senator -- Chris Dodd announced he is retiring at the end of his term. Dodd's approval rating began to fall after he allegedly received sweetheart loans from Countrywide Mortgage. You might know the story. He got the loans while he was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, although he claims he didn't realize he was getting special treatment. He said he didn't understand how the bank loan system worked, see, which would be a good argument if you weren't the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book out claims that Franklin Delano Roosevelt secretly had skin cancer and that's what actually killed him in 1945. Now, this is a stunning claim because if it turns out to be true, it would make no difference whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists are now developing wearable wireless sensors to monitor overweight people as they go about their daily lives. See, that's when you we Americans are getting too fat, okay? ... When they're tracking us like whales, that's bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that, researchers in Great Britain have developed a...dinner plate to fight obesity. It senses how much food is on the plate and how fast you're eating it. And if you eat too fast, the plate tells you to slow down and reminds you to eat less. They say there are no long-term studies because most people smash the plate after the second&quot; they &quot;eat off of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold here in New York City. And I'm always screaming about the global warming. Maybe I'm wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people flew to get here? I mean, come on, isn't flying more fun than it used to be? I mean, really. They make you take off your shoes, make you take off your underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean you think about the guy, the...Nigerian guy, he is going to blow up the thing. ... He was wearing a pair of Fruit of the Lunatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guy was not too bright. He said that the reason he became a suicide bomber was to work his way up in the al Qaeda organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks know anything about the Skull And Bones society. It's like a fraternal organization, at Yale University. Well, they're auctioning off a human skull. ... And I was thinking about this. I believe this is the first empty skull to come out of Yale, well, I think since George W. Bush, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legal experts are saying, if he's convicted, the underwear bomber could be sentenced to life in Federal prison. ... But even worse, for the rest of his life, he'll be known as the underwear bomber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, President Obama will visit the auto show in Detroit and look at cars from the Big Three automakers. ... Or, as the Big Three automakers put it, 'the new owner is coming for a visit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Yesterday, a naked jogger was stopped near the White House. ... Secret Service grabbed the man and immediately allowed him to attend a state dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some people are really upset because President Obama has decided to redecorate the Oval Office, and he got rid of former President Bush's bust of Winston Churchill. ... When he heard about it, Bush was furious and said, 'Winston Churchill? I thought that was Higgins from 'Magnum P.I.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a man in Washington, DC, was apprehended by Secret Service yesterday for taking off his clothes and jogging naked near the White House. In...related news, I say that's probably the last time Biden ever takes Ambien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Budget Director Peter Orszag&quot; had &quot;a baby with...a beautiful shipping heiress, just weeks before he got engaged to this other beautiful lady, who is a news reporter.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an effort to calm people down after this latest security problem, the White House said it is working even harder to find Osama bin Laden. And here's the frustrating part. Turns out we almost had him. Did you hear about this? Earlier this year, he snuck into a White House state dinner. Nobody recognized him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is something quite serious and frightening. On a Delta flight from Miami to Detroit, a man of Palestinian descent stood up on the plane and yelled, 'I want to kill all the Jews.' And there was silence on the plane. Even more silence when the flight attendant said, 'Who ordered the kosher meal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love...this. The underwear bomber pleaded not guilty in court today. He had a bomb in his underpants, okay! 'What is your defense?' 'I didn't know there was a bomb in my underpants.' Oh, 'I was framed by the Fruit of the Loom guys.' What are you doing? How could you plead not -- there was a bomb in your underpants. So stupid!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Post,' White House Budget Director Peter Orszag announced his engagement to an ABC News reporter six weeks after his ex- girlfriend gave birth to his baby. And of course, people were shocked. 'The White House has a budget director?' 'Where's he been?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Senate rejected a gay marriage bill. Now, why? Last time a gay man got married in New Jersey, he went on to become governor of the state, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody's coming to New York City any more. ... The only foreign visitors we're getting are from Guantanamo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the guy? He starts off in Nigeria, then to Amsterdam and to Detroit. And just as they are landing in Detroit he tries to get his underpants to explode. ... So they jump the guy and they save the whole plane load of people and finally the commotion woke up the pilot and he comes...running out. And he puts out the fire with his pitcher of margaritas. Thank God! Had a happy ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the...governor from Illinois that was selling in the Senate seat? Remember Rod Blagojevich? ... Listen to this now. He will be appearing on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' ... I hate to see them water down the strict use of the word celebrity, don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But already, there was a very ugly incident. You are not going to believe what happened. In the early rehearsals of 'Celebrity Apprentice', that thing on Trump's head attacked the thing on Blagojevich's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going to an auto show that will feature all the hot new models from the Big Three automakers. ... No word yet on when he gets back from Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, yesterday, former President Clinton stopped by the White House for a meeting with President Obama. ... Then, out of habit, Clinton left by shimmying down the drain pipe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While speaking about the war on terror yesterday, President Obama said, 'There is of course, no fool-proof solution. We have to stay one step ahead of a nimble adversary.' Nimble adversary? Sounds like somebody saw 'Sherlock Holmes' over the holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also said, 'We are at war against al Qaeda' and 'we will do whatever it takes to defeat them.' Then Obama was like, 'Literally, whatever it takes -- speeches, talks, speech talks, talks about speeches, speaking about the talk I just spoke about, personal appearances.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with former President Bill Clinton at the White House yesterday in a meeting closed to the press. It was pretty awkward. Hillary called. And at the exact same time, they both said, 'I'm not here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys excited about the final season of 'Lost'? ... Well, fans are worried that the show's three-hour season premiere on February 2nd could be bumped if President Obama gives his State of the Union speech that night, which is ironic, because 'Lost' is also the name of the speech he plans on giving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mexican government is upset Starbucks is using a pre-Aztec logo without permission. In fairness, Mexico is using the United States without permission.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may know, our show has been canceled. ... NBC has some pilots to fill up the 10:00 p.m. time slot. ... They're talking about bringing back 'All in the Family', with Harry Reid as Archie Bunker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Harry Reid in hot water about some remarks he made about then-candidate Barack Obama that have been perceived as to be racially insensitive. He spent most of the day on the phone apologizing to prominent African-American leaders. But you know, I still don't think he gets it. Like today, at a press conference, he says, 'I hope this doesn't leave a black mark on my record.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Friday, the White House announced that President Obama's State of the Union address scheduled for next month will not air on the same night as the premiere of 'Lost' on ABC. ... Well, they did that because they thought viewers might get confused. See, lost is also the State of the Union: Lost jobs; lost wage; lost houses; lost businesses. So, the two -- you can get them mixed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said they're working even harder now to try and find Osama bin Laden. In fact, they have now put his picture on the side of cartons of goat's milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of John McCain's former top campaign aides says that when he talked to Sarah Palin after McCain picked her to be his running mate, she said it was 'God's plan.' ... So, apparently, God wanted Obama to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has just signed with Fox News. So, now they're fair and unbalanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm tired of being cold. And I'm upset with that Al Gore, too. Always shooting his mouth off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold down in Washington, DC. It was so cold today that Senator Harry Reid actually enjoyed being in hot water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, you know what he said? That there were no terrorist attacks during the Bush Administration. Well...you know, that would be great if it was true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And apparently, the Mayor misspoke. He forgot about the attack of 9/11. Yeah, forgot about that one. Forgot about the shoe bomber, there was another one. Forgot about Dick Cheney duck hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, is going to be part of the Fox News team. ... So, yeah. Finally, finally, her years of reading all those newspapers and magazines&quot; have &quot;really paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should balance things out over at...Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for Sarah Palin. She was hired as a commentator for Fox News. She signed a multi-year contract, which means she'll probably quit after a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some critics are saying that Palin won't last on Fox because she's an over-emotional woman who...gets the facts wrong. But I disagree. It's working great for Glenn Beck, so she'll be fine. 'What?!' 'You heard me!' 'Hey, wait a minute!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is under fire for discussing whether or not President Obama has a 'negro dialect.' ... Reid is also in trouble for saying Joe Lieberman 'talks all Moses-y.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. In his weekly radio and Internet address, President Obama said 'we are on the verge' of guaranteeing Americans health insurance 'whether they lose their job, change jobs, move or get sick,' which means Jay, Conan and I are going to be just fine. So don't worry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin just signed on to be a contributor to the Fox News Channel. She chose the job after carefully weighing her other option, just going away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Sarah Palin, I was watching '60 Minutes' last night and a former McCain campaign aid said that when Palin found out she would become John McCain's running mate, she said, 'It's God's plan,' to which God responded, 'What? Really? Don't bring me into this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that 5% of baby boomers admit to getting high and popping pills. Come on now. I know he's a big guy but it's not fair to call Rush Limbaugh 5% of baby boomers. ... That's just rude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it's Monday. ... In the meetings, we recap the wacky stories of the weekend, kind of look at what we have to choose from, hopefully a politician saying some crazy things. 'Blagojevich says, 'I'm blacker than Barack Obama.&quot; Wow! Whoa! ... Oh, snap! Rod Blagojevich is so black, he should be called 'Tyler Perry Presents Rod Blagojevich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's definitely a bold claim. What's he using to back it up? 'I shined shoes. I grew up in a five-room apartment. My father had a little laundromat in a black community not far from where we lived.' A five-room apartment and your dad owned a business that made money off the black community. I...think you're confusing black with middle class white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least there are no pre-disgraced Democrats making ridiculously tone deaf racial statements. 'News that Harry Reid praised Obama's electability as a -- quote ? 'light skinned' African-American ? quote ? 'with no negro dialect unless he wanted to have one', risks weakening the Senate majority leader.' I'm sure Harry Reid will use the world negro, especially if comes right before the words college fund on the hefty check that I'm sure he's writing at this very moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, over the Christmas break,&quot; a man &quot;tried to blow up a plane bound for Detroit. The would-be terrorist was this Nigerian guy, or as Harry Reid would like to put it, 'a dark-skinned negro.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well off course, the big political story, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid got himself in hot water during the election, when he described Barack Obama as a 'light-skinned' African-American 'with no negro dialect.' ... See, that may explain why Reid was the Senate Majority Leader and not the Senate Minority Leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Obama forgave him. Obama said today, he has 'nothing against really light-skinned people who talk with a cracker dialect.' So it all worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen him on the news? Harry Reid is apologizing more than NBC affiliates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is not the only one. Impeached Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, what a moron this guy is. He's in trouble after saying he's 'blacker than Barack Obama.' Barack Obama? He's not even blacker than Sammy Sosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A...terrific new book out called 'Game Change' ? it claims during the 2008 election, while Bill Clinton was asking Ted Kennedy to support Hillary, Clinton said of Obama, 'A few years ago,' he 'would have been getting' our coffee. But Clinton says that's not true. He said his real words were, 'Man, I'd like to nail that waitress.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of Sarah Palin's First Day At Fox News:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Ruined office floor by drilling for oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Detached a retina from winking at the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Got confused -- thought she'd signed with QVC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pistol-whipped three guys who called her 'Tina.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Released a statement saying she won't follow Leno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. At lunchtime, Todd picked her up driving snowmobile through lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Sad to learn there was no actual fox to hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hosted a 'Fire Dave' roundtable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Actually found a place with more white people than Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Announced plans to run for president in 2010.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of minutes ago, Conan O'Brien, who was the host of 'The Tonight Show' over there at NBC, announced that he would not follow Jay Leno at 12:05. ... If Conan does leave 'The Tonight Show', President Obama then has to appoint a replacement. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, according to the 'New York Times', al Qaeda is claiming responsibility for the wreckage at NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess whose birthday it is today. Rush Limbaugh -- 59 years old. ... Also, celebrity birthday, Kirstie Alley --59 years old today, too. This explains the nationwide cake shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big, big week for giant announcements. Have you seen the 'American Idol' show? ... One of the...judges on the show, Simon Cowell, announced this will be the last season on the show. ... Cowell is the only high-ranking judge that Sarah Palin could name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book. Sarah Palin said that on the campaign tour sometimes, she was glassy-eyed and out of it. ... You know, like NBC executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is joining Fox News. ... The new slogan is 'hair and unbalanced.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Sarah Palin appeared on 'The O'Reilly Factor' with Bill O'Reilly. ... Talk about a bridge to nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the really big news is...Conan O'Brien said in a written statement that he will not do 'The Tonight Show' after Jay Leno. I think. But then he also said he wants to make 'The Tonight Show' the best it can be, which means he didn't quit. I think. I don't know. I have no idea. I'm sure the lawyers will figure that out. ... Actually, I can think of a much better solution than the lawyers. Here's what I think we should do here -- government bailout money. It worked with Wall Street. Why doesn't Congress give NBC money to make more late night shows? That would solve everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But for now, it looks like Jay's back on at 11:30. Now people are getting their old jobs back. How long before Dick Cheney shows up at the White House? 'Hey Biden, heard you turned my dungeon into breakfast nook. You bastard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is in the news. He's still under fire for remarks he made about President Obama's blackness. ... Sources say he could face congressional censure or even worse, be promised 'The Tonight Show' at 11:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin made her debut as a Fox News contributor tonight on 'The O'Reilly Factor.' ... I tried to record it but my DVR quit half way through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big political news out of New Jersey lately. The New Jersey Senate just approved a bill to legalize medical marijuana, a week...after New Jersey voted not to allow gay marriage, which means the New Jersey Senate was like, 'Gay people getting married? What are you, like, high? No? Well, let's get high then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is going to be a commentator for Fox News. Well maybe now she can afford to buy some clothes for Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Plain will be a regular contributor to Fox News. She signed a three-year contract, which means she should be there for, what, six months?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating is down to 46%. ... But the White House has an idea for how to get it back up again. What they're going to do is...bring back Bush and Cheney for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'New York Times' is saying that Fox News has signed Sarah Palin. ... Sarah Palin to be a Fox News contributor. Their slogan is 'fair and balanced,' and now they're going to replace the slogan with 'You betcha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin says she can see Rupert Murdoch from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin also said that she...can't wait to start making up the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news from Afghanistan. Did you hear about this? Critics of the war have stopped referring to it as another Vietnam. ... The bad news? They're now calling it another NBC.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people don't like these airport body scanners. They say they don't like security officials seeing naked images of their bodies. Huh? Have you seen most Americans lately? Come on. It's no picnic for the security people either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government issued a statement this week saying most people aren't complaining about the full body scanners. See, the government always says that. Every time...there's another intrusion into our privacy, they say most people aren't complaining. Well, of course, most people aren't complaining. You know what happens when you complain at airport security? You get a colonoscopy and wind up on a terrorists watch list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's growing more and more likely that California will legalize marijuana. You mean it's not already legal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what that means? One day in California, you could be buying legalized marijuana at a Wal-Mart from a cashier who's not even legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has signed on to become a Fox News correspondent. And in a related story, John McCain just picked up an endorsement deal to be a spokesman for the SCOOTER Store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book out about&quot; the most recent US presidential &quot;campaign. In the book, it says Sarah Palin was unprepared to be vice president. And I thought, boy, you think you know somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a...new...'TV Guide' poll, 83% of voters -- 83% -- want me to stay at 11:35. And here's the interesting part. ... When he heard this poll number, President Obama asked, 'How can I get NBC to screw me over?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report says that one year after Obama took office, 40% of top positions in his Administration have yet to be filled.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has signed with Fox News to be a correspondent.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, security is being upgraded at airports all across the country. They're really cracking down. In fact, today, Osama bin Laden's name was put on the do-not-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks know what is going on with NBC and...the trouble they're having with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien? ... I thought this was nice. President Obama invited Jay and Conan to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our good friend, Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, is a contributor to Fox News. ... Only been there a couple days. Already making friends. Today, she loaned Glenn Beck some mascara that does not run when you cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's doing a lot of public speaking and next week she will be in Las Vegas speaking at a liquor convention. And what a coincidence because I think McCain was drunk when he picked her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported...that an 8-year-old boy from New Jersey is on the government's airport watch list, because he has the same name as a possible terrorist. ... So, it's been a really bad week for little Skippy bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's big news out of Washington today. President Obama announced a plan to recover Federal bailout money from banks. I guess that explains why Biden was seen yesterday buying a gun and a ski mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with 'People' magazine, Michelle Obama said that she's heard about MTV's 'Jersey Shore,' but she hasn't seen it. It's funny. That's exactly what the people on 'Jersey Shore' said about the Obamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin started a new job as a contributor to Fox News. The first day there, she sat down with Bill O'Reilly. Went very well.

I'm actually a little nervous as she is one of the only people that I can see that can possibly lead us out of where we are. I don't know yet if she's strong enough.' Look at Palin's face.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heaviest snowfall in over 60 years is being reported in Beijing, China. To give you an idea of how bad it is, the army is now having to use snowplows to run over dissidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Obama told the bankers that received the bailout money that instead of fighting these new regulations and fees, they should simply consider meeting their responsibilities. Well that's a good strategy. To the guys that screwed us out of billions of dollars, let's appeal to their sense of honesty and fair play. Well, that'll work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. ... As you know, all the banks are closed, and I understand, tomorrow, some of them might even reopen.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Time' magazine, executives at the Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs were paid an average...of $600,000 last year. And that was just by Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' an eight-year-old boy is on the terrorism watch list because he has the same name as someone on the no-fly list. His mom says he's been on the no-fly list since he was two years old. ... But to be fair, how many flyers would like to see all two-year-olds on the no-fly list?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota introducing a new version of the Prius. They say it is a smaller, less powerful version. A less powerful version? Isn't that pretty much a Rascal Scooter at this point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Excuses Of The Naked White House Jogger:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'It was my salute to the Washington Monument.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Doctor suggested I do more nude cardio.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Why should only airport scanners see me naked?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'It's a sweltering nine degrees outside.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'I'm Dick Cheney and if I want to jog naked, dammit I'll jog naked!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Distraught over Carson Daly's future.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'It's change we can believe in.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Wasn't this cool when Bubba was president?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Good lord, was I hammered!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Naked? I was wearing a hat!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are worried about NBC. Earlier today, President Obama announced that he's sending in 30,000 troops. Out to Burbank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have built now, robotic women. ... They're anatomically correct, they have synthetic skin, and they can carry on minimal conversations. As a matter of fact, the Republican Party wants to run one for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book out that says Sarah Palin was an ignoramus who believes Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11. And I thought, well, no, that's George Bush. Wasn't that George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Osama bin Laden's sons has written a book. And remember how excited we all were when we captured Osama bin Laden? Oh yeah, that didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, one of his kids has written a book. ... And he said his father was a cruel parent. ... For example, he made the kid wait until he was 18 years old before he let him blow up his first car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI has released a sketch of what Osama bin Laden looks like now. You know, he's aged. It's been, like, nine years. ... So the FBI puts out a sketch so we can get an idea what he looks like nine years older. And I said, 'Why don't we put out a sketch of what he looks like when he's captured?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Chemical Ali? ... He's been sentenced to death. Now this is the fourth time he's been sentenced to death. ... He's very confused. He hasn't decided what to order for his fourth last meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House issued a statement today. They're blaming government inefficiencies ? this is true ? they're blaming it on old computers. ... Apparently, all the computers keep crashing. And everyone knows the only crashing tolerated at the White House is during state dinners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said they're replacing any technology that's obsolete, broken down and causes problems. Desktops, laptops, Joe Biden: It's all going out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US State Department has released an updated photo of Osama bin Laden that shows what he might look like after aging a decade. ... And guess what. Somebody got fat!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama said she doesn't let her daughters watch the show 'Jersey Shore.' ... When asked why, the First Lady said, 'Because I love my children.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama attended his daughter Malia's school recital. Not to see her perform or anything. Just to see if any of the kids had a solution to healthcare. And they didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During Malia's recital, Obama was so proud. He kept turning to other parents saying, 'That's my daughter up there.' And the other parents were like, 'You mean the snowflake surrounded by Secret Service? Yeah, we got it. We know who your daughter is.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone around the country is still focused on healthcare. President Obama recently said, 'We've spent so much time talking about the House bill versus the Senate bill that we haven't been able to talk about how great the bill is overall.' Then someone asked him how great it was and he was like, 'Not that great.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very sweet. President Obama threw Michelle a surprise birthday party on Saturday night, which is why all week long, Joe Biden was like, 'Hi, Michelle. Nothing new going on here. No secrets being kept, surprises being planned. Certainly no surprise parties. What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that a year into Obama's first term in office, unemployment is higher, the national debt is higher, and there are more soldiers serving in Afghanistan. When asked about it, Obama...was like, 'Yeah, technically that is change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll by TripAdvisor found that crying children are the worst airplane passengers. Second worst airplane passengers? Terrorists. 'Ma'am, can you tell your baby to be quiet? I have an underwear bomb I have to focus up on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, the FBI unveiled a massive Times Square billboard with a rotating display of the most wanted criminals in the US. It's all part of a new FBI plan called 'distract tourists while they have their wallets stolen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight in Massachusetts, where tomorrow, voters will go to the polls in a special election to fill the Senate seat that Ted Kennedy held for 46 years, a seat that he won in a special election to replace his brother John, who had won it himself in a super-secret...election to replace his brother, George Kennedy, who had left to go film 'The Dirty Dozen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, like you, I am super jazzed about tomorrow's special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy's vacant Senate seat. Because, folks, this isn't just any election. 'The voters of Massachusetts are well aware that this is a national referendum on the healthcare bill.' 'It's become a national election.' 'Fundamentally, this is a national election.' Thank you! This is the kind of national election I love, the kind that gets decided by one state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race is between Democrat Martha Coakley and a Republican I have long supported, Scott, I want to say Brown. Is it Brown? It is Brown? That's why I wanted to say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the early days of coal mining, it was dirty, dangerous work. ... Thankfully, modern science has found a much safer way to get our coal: Blowing the tops off mountains! Awesome!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great. You start with some boring, tree-covered mountain, and you turn it into an exciting, lifeless moon base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, it is the most efficient way to get to the coal inside. That's why when I go to the dentist, I have him remove my teeth through the top of my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, unfortunately, not everyone out there gets it, like the EPA. In September, they put 79 mountain removal projects on hold. Who made the EPA the protector of the environment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, good news, nation, this month the EPA reversed their position and awarded a permit for a 600-acre mine in West Virginia to the Patriot Coal Corporation. You know it's patriotic coal because they're using their bombs bursting in air to turn those purple mountain majesties into amber waves of gray.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all the major airlines have raised their fees to check in baggage. In fact, it's getting so expensive now to bring bags on board, even people who aren't terrorists are stuffing things into their underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Shady Lady brothel in Nevada has a 25-year-old man named Marcus and he's become the first legal male prostitute in American history. Well, the first one not elected to the US Senate, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know up in Massachusetts, the big election, are you following what's going on up there? Ted Kennedy's Senate seat...is now up for grabs. The election is pretty close. I was thinking, you know, my money is on Jay Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember...the Salahis? ... Barack Obama...throws a state dinner for the prime minister of India. And guess who shows up? The Salahis. Well, they weren't invited. ... Tomorrow, they're going to be appearing before Homeland Security to talk about that. It should be exciting. ... Ricky Gervais is hosting. It'll be great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chrysler is recalling 24,000 cars. ... May be a problem with the brake system. ... I said to myself, 'Holy crap! They sold 24,000 cars. Really? Well, good for them. I mean, who cares if the brakes work? They're moving cars left and right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Saddam Hussein's buddy, Chemical Ali? ... He recently was sentenced to his fourth death sentence. ... Boy, I hope this doesn't tarnish his nice guy image.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something that I think bothers all of us. Osama bin Laden is still out doing whatever it is he does. And so the FBI...updated his likeness. ... So the FBI has gotten the original photograph and they've enhanced it...to show what Osama bin Laden looks like now. And if you're interested, you can see it. They put it on a carton of goat's milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read President Obama plans to deliver his State of the Union address next Wednesday, January 27th. Until then, he's just at home going, 'Please everything get better by Wednesday. Please everything get better by Wednesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell the President is losing some of his popularity. Today, Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan visited elementary school kids in Virginia. And the kids were like, 'Oh, my gosh. ... It's Arne Duncan! It's Arne Duncan, look! Can I have your autograph? It's Arne Duncan!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, in 2009, the FBI reported a 20% decrease in the number of people robbing banks. There was, however, a huge increase in the number of banks robbing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it was last February: Federal government called before them the titans of Wall Street for a...bit of a talking to. ... Cut to a year later, thanks to the bailouts, the banks are thriving, bonuses back up to record levels, and these guys still don't get it. Well not for long. A...bipartisan commission charged with finding the causes of the financial crisis has been formed. ... They're coming, Wall Street, and they're going to be writing a report that is due out, in December? That's like, 11 months. ... By then, these bankers are...probably going to be packaging something called breathing swaps. When did my bank add the $45 oxygen to carbon dioxide conversion fee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I am sick and tired of Muslim terrorists and their secular progressive soul mates claiming that America is waging a crusade. ... Our military is not engaged in a holy war. And I don't know where they are getting that idea, other than from ABC News. 'Some soldiers call them 'Jesus rifles.' That's because the sights on their guns contain a secret coded reference to New Testament passages about Jesus Christ.' Technically, 'Jesus rifles' aren't a holy war. They're more like an armor-piercing Sunday school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, these 'Jesus rifles,' as they're called, were manufactured by Trijicon, which ends all serial numbers of their rifle scopes with New Testament verses. 'Here, JN8.12, a reference to the Book of John, Chapter eight, Verse 12, which reads in part, 'Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying I am the light of the world.' And I assume the full verse ends in, 'Eat hot lead, Haji.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to believe President Obama has now been in office for a year. ... And you know, it's incredible. He took something that was in terrible, terrible shape, and he brought it back from the brink of disaster. The Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that question, what can brown do for you? Apparently he can stop the Democrats' healthcare plan. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a big upset victory. Republican Scott Brown defeated Democrat Martha Chokely -- I mean Coakley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama called Coakley and said, 'Well, we can't win them all.' The same thing he said after the New Jersey governor's race, the Virginia governor's race, 2016 Olympic bid, and the Copenhagen Climate Summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats had a number of explanations as to why they lost Ted Kennedy's seat. The White House said today, Scott brown won because he ran a 'clever campaign.' And Harry Reid said he won 'because he's a light skinned Brown, with no negro accent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Sarah Palin, now going to be a VIP guest at next month's Daytona 500. She won't have any official role. So it will be like when she ran for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans elected a new senator from the state of Massachusetts. His name is Scott Brown. That's one of those names they give you in the witness relocation program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a year ago today that the President moved into the White House. An since that time, his hair's gone gray, he's made some people mad at him, he's let down...quite a lot of his supporters, which makes him perfect for his new job, host of 'The Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was...a big Senate race in Massachusetts yesterday. The winner, Scott brown, made a victory speech where he mentioned his two daughters were available. ... At least this explains his campaign slogan, 'Scott Brown, creepy for Massachusetts, creepy for America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a huge Senate race in Massachusetts yesterday. ... Republican Scott Brown pulled off the upset. Now some Democrats are accusing their candidate, Martha Coakley, of running a lackluster campaign. They were especially confused by her campaign slogan, 'I guess we can?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So a Republican won. So, when Scott Brown takes office, Democrats will lose their filibuster-proof Senate majority. And he's vowed to oppose the healthcare bill. That's a nice way to start your first day, huh? 'Hey, I'm the new guy. Hate what you're doing here. Bad to meet you. Not a fan. You are the worst.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey found that only 19% of kids give President Obama an A on his first year in office, and 16% gave him an F. Malia was like, 'This is the best possible day to tell dad about my D in social studies. This is so cool.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Erroll Southers, Obama's pick to head the TSA, withdrew his name because he performed an illegal background check on his ex-wife's boyfriend. ... Still, that's an improvement from the TSA's normal procedure -- not performing background checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night in the state of Massachusetts. After the smoke had cleared and the chowder-filled vomit was hosed off the streets, the results of their special election to fill Ted Kennedy's vacant Senate seat were decisive: Republican upstart Scott Brown 51.9%, Democrat log bump Martha Coakley 47.1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, do you feel the electricity in the room right now? You feel it! And it's all because last night, the Massachusetts Senate seat previously held by liberal lion Ted Kennedy was won by a Republican! ... It was morning in America, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Gettysburg, and the all-you-can-eat wing night at Chili's all rolled up into one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in political news, the big upset. A Republican was elected to the US Senate in Massachusetts, filling a seat once held by Ted Kennedy. So, this could tip the delicate balance of power in the US Senate from the completely incompetent back to the morally corrupt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Thursday, January 21st, or as John Edwards calls it, 'Father's Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Edwards has finally admitted he is the father of Rielle Hunter's baby. He issued a statement. Really? Who is the statement for? The only person that doesn't know he's the father of Rielle Hunter's baby is Rielle Hunter's baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards' former aide...says in an upcoming interview that Edwards asked him to steal a diaper from the baby to do a DNA test. Apparently, the test shows that both the diaper and John Edwards were full of crap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprising Facts About Scott Brown:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. He's the nephew of 'Godfather of Soul', James Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Climate change is partly the result of his smoldering hunkiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. His response to the healthcare reform crisis: 'Don't blame Conan.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Got his start in politics by rounding up illegals to work in Mitt Romney's yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Once in state senate, cracked a walnut with his a@#.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Purchased his first car at Harrison Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Promised people of Massachusetts he'd bring back witch trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When his daughter was finalist on 'American Idol,' he exchanged beauty tips with Ryan Seacrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. His election helped GOP ratings skyrocket to 17 percent!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. So cold in Boston today he actually put on pants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Massachusetts? You got a new senator, congratulations. Do you know anything about this guy. His name is Scott Brown. ... Isn't that the guy Elvis played in 'Clambake'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's talk a look at this deal now. Massachusetts elects a Republican who drives a truck with 200,000 miles on it. It's a Chevy truck. Which is more hard to believe now? Massachusetts elects a Republican or Chevy builds a truck that lasts 200,000 miles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know...the Democratic candidate, was like, two weeks ago, ahead by 20 points. ... And she blew it. Here's what happened. ... Apparently, she put in the Patriots defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he blames himself for the upset in the Massachusetts Senate race because he was too remote. ... Meanwhile, today in Arizona, John McCain couldn't find his remote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC and I have finally reached a separation agreement. ... I'd like to apologize to the guests that were scheduled for next week. President Barack Obama, the pope, the queen of England, and our good friend, Elvis Presley, was stopping by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today officially marks the beginning of President Obama's second year in office. ... He has three years left, but NBC offered him $45 million to leave altogether. So, we'll see what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his acceptance speech Tuesday, newly elected Senator Scott Brown told the crowd that two of his older daughters are both available. Man, so many great American speeches, right? 'Four score and seven years ago,' 'ask not what your country can do for you,' 'I have a dream', and now, 'my daughters are both available.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled today that the government cannot stop corporations from spending money on political candidates. This explains why Sarah Palin just accepted $1 million to change her name to Pizza Hut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court today...ruled in a five votes to four decision that corporations can now spend as much as they want on political campaigns. In other words, if Exxon or Dow wants to support a candidate, they can give him or her as much money as they want. ... I can't see that having any negative repercussions, can you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court ruled that corporations should be given the same right to free speech as people, which is ? I mean, corporations are not people, and if they were people, they'd be real jerks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidential candidate John Edwards has finally admitted that he did father a love child with his former mistress, Rielle Hunter. ... How does that work? Do you still hand out cigars? ... Should I send something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, is love child really the best way of describing what happened? ... I think it was more of a seven gin and tonics child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He released a statement today. Edwards said, 'It was wrong for me ever to deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she'll forgive me.' Hey, if she inherits that hair, what's to forgive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We have that bombshell statement now from Sen. John Edwards admitted that he fathered a child with former campaign worker, Rielle Hunter.' 'Quoting now: 'I am Quinn's father. It was wrong for me to ever deny she was my daughter and hopefully one day, when she understands, she' will forgive me.' 'Hopefully one day she'll forgive me.' I think that's something John Edwards pretty much could add to every sentence he says from now on in his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, once again there's trouble brewing in Afghanistan. According to 'The New York Times' Taliban leader Mullah Omar has issued a 'new code of conduct' banning suicide bombing, 'burning down schools' and 'cutting off ears, lips and tongues.' It is all part of a 'public relations campaign' to 'soften their image.' ... Now I'm sure a lot of people were on the fence about these guys before, but now that they've stopped cutting off ears, lips and tongues, they're appealing to a broader demo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the one year anniversary of Barack Obama's inauguration. I'll never forget where I was that day: At Kinko's, making a fake Kenyan birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one year later I have to ask: Has Barack Obama failed? Or has he succeeded, at failing?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all love celebrity birthdays. You know whose birthday it is today? ... Yakov Smirnoff. Famous Russian comedian, 59 years old, and he celebrated. Spent the entire day waving to Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama met with a group of mayors at the White House. He told them that he was glad not to be running a city during this recession. It's part of Obama's new campaign slogan, 'Sucks to be you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you guys remember this. Obama wanted to close the Guantanamo Bay prison by today, but it turns out he's going to miss his deadline by a full year. Imagine what would happen at your job if you miss a deadline by a year? 'Hey, Gary, been waiting on that Johnson report for -- well, it's been a year now. ... Maybe think about wrapping it up, maybe getting it on my desk. I'd definitely like to see it by the end of this year, maybe, huh. Take your time, Gary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys following the big healthcare fight? Not going well for the Democrats at all. Nancy Pelosi said yesterday that the House doesn't have enough votes to pass the Senate's healthcare bill. ... A few more elections and the House won't have Nancy Pelosi either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been raining here in Los Angeles all week. ... People are evacuating their homes in areas that are vulnerable to mudslides. Is it me or has this state had nothing but disasters since Arnold Schwarzenegger took over as governor?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' the Taliban is trying to soften their image to appeal to the people of Afghanistan. And in fact, Mullah Omar, whose one of their managers, I think, issued a new code of conduct...which dictates that there will be no suicide bombings against Afghani civilians, no burning down schools, and no cutting off the ears, nose, or tongue. That seems reasonable to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife...and her daughter, Meghan, have posed for pictures endorsing pro-gay marriage here in California, although Senator McCain -- well, he's still very traditional. He believes marriage should be between an older man and a really hot-looking younger woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I saw John McCain today. He and John Edwards were at the same store. They were both buying diapers, but for different reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, John Edwards has finally admitted he's the father of Rielle Hunter's baby. There's a shock. Who saw that coming? Given how long it took him to admit it, the kid is now old enough not to vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, John Edwards said today he's going to help raise the little girl. He said he's looking forward to teaching his daughter everything he knows about hair care products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And learning more and more about the new Massachusetts senator, Scott brown. Well, you probably know this. Back in 1982, posed naked for 'Cosmo.' Yeah, isn't that amazing? He's got it backwards. First you get elected to the Senate, then you get caught with your pants down. It's the other way. He seems to be very confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is kind of embarrassing. At a speech to school kids in an elementary school in Virginia, President Obama used the teleprompter. He had a teleprompter set up to talk to the kids. The topic of the speech: Never taking the easy way out by bringing a cheat sheet to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints. They're going to the Super Bowl. ... The Saints beat the Vikings. ... Former President George Bush Sr., he was at the...game. Now, his son, George W., was invited, but you know him, when it comes to New Orleans, he's always, like, two weeks late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the halftime show is The Who this year. ... NFL officials are concerned now that Brett Favre's out of the Super Bowl, because he's the only player old enough to know who The Who are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not always easy to fill a half hour comedy program. ... That's why we here are especially grateful for those frequent contributors, those who give more than their fair share, like the state of South Carolina, whose...governors use taxpayer funds to fly to Argentina to see their mistress. ... But what has South Carolina done for us lately? ... &quot;Feeding stray animals.' That's the metaphor Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer used to describe families who receive free or reduced price meals in public schools.' Free lunch kids are 'stray animals'? Oh, I see why the governor's still there. Because the guy who would replace him, the lieutenant governor, is a nightmare. Oh, South Carolina, you just keep on giving, don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The President of the United States, Barack Obama, was summoned for jury duty in Cook County. The White House contacted the court system there to say that he was unavailable to serve.' He's not serving jury duty?! I've been called for duty a dozen times, and they never let me go when I tell them I'm President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say if President Obama wants to get out of jury duty, he should do what the rest of us do. Show up, wet yourself, get in a fistfight with the stenographer, and tell the judge that you are afraid of Koreans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, Barack Obama's got a bigger problem than dodging jury duty: The economy. ... That's why on Friday the President traveled to Ohio to give this speech. 'I'm not going to stop fighting until we have jobs for everybody!' Mr. President, talk is cheap. Though due to soaring unemployment, no one can afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the President understands that in America, consumption equals jobs. And these days, banks aren't lending us the money we need to buy the things we don't need to create the jobs we need to pay back the loans we can't afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former sitcom star Scott Baio...got death threats over a distasteful tweet he made regarding First Lady Michelle Obama. It took death threats to remind us that Scott Baio is still alive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Death threats for Scott Baio. Apparently, not everybody loves Chachi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So he contacted the FBI to investigate death threats. But you can't make a distasteful tweet about the First Lady, and then call a government agency. They're not going to take your call. 'Like, yeah, uh-huh, ok.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, President Obama will give his State of the Union address. The White House says the speech will focus on American jobs. So, I guess he's going to talk a lot about India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Focus on jobs. This is going to be the shortest speech in history. 'Hey, there aren't any. Thank you. Good night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has now been called for jury duty in Chicago. ... I think he should go. I mean, the economy is in bad shape. We could use...five bucks a day. Every little bit helps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that California can save money by no longer incarcerating illegal immigrants and just sending them to Mexico instead. Well, actually, today, the immigrants had three words for Schwarzenegger --- 'I'll be back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for Goldman Sachs. Did you know the tax rate it paid on its profits last year was .6%? ... And of course, the CEO of Goldman Sachs was furious when he heard this. He said, 'What? When did we start paying taxes? This is ridiculous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart announced it's cutting over 11,000 jobs. Wal-Mart said it's cheaper to fire people in bulk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's an amazing amount of people: 11,000 jobs. The problem is they made the announcement in English, so everybody kept showing up for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Osama bin Laden has issued a new audio tape praising the failed Christmas Day airline bombing and...warning more attacks to come to the United States.' ... Bin Laden comments on the Christmas underwear bomber now? That was like a month ago. ... You should change your name to Osama bin Procrastinating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As many of you are aware, this financial crisis is creating a little bit of tension between Wall Street titans and the other 6.5 billion people on Earth. And after handing over billions of dollars in bailout funds to banks, President Obama may have had enough. 'The President, noting the outrage in this country after the financial collapse, said it's time to go after the banks and the bankers, and if they want a fight, they'll get one.' Don't fight him, bankers! It's a trap. He has an army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what weapon does Wall Street have? 'The third consecutive triple-digit loss for the Dow since the President came out swinging against the banks on Wednesday.' Oh my God, they're taking hostages! 'If you ever want to see your 401(k) again, I suggest you put down your regulations. No, no, I'm serious. I will decrease your...dividends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is this happening? 'We would have been up huge on earnings today if it weren't for the President's decision to downsize the banking system.' 'The market hates the Obama plan.' 'Everything that we've seen coming out of Washington, the market doesn't like it.' 'Investor confidence was completely shattered by what you got from the Obama Administration. 'The market does not like nationalization.' 'The market hates this. It hates the stimulus. It hates the bailouts.' Well then give us back our...money!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess that explains why the market is up 16% since Obama took over and it's up 30% since the stimulus package was signed and why the banks have posted record profits. I mean, they're doing it, they're just probably not happy about it. You know, they said Obama was going to redistribute the wealth. They never said which direction. See, I figured this out. Obama's a socialist but he's also dyslexic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight in Washington,&quot; President Barack Obama &quot;gave his...State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress. Joint session sounds like more fun than it is.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The speech tonight was pretty much the same thing we hear over and over again, asking us...for patience and a willingness to sacrifice, things we are totally unwilling to do as Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then after the President spoke, the Republicans gave their rebuttal, during which they pointed out that Obama has repeatedly failed to solve any of the problems they created under President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither one of these parties cares as much about the country as they do about being the one who gets to run the country. It's a big waste, and it's a big waste of air time that could be better spent on celebrities ice skating or conveyor belts of love, things like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, you all probably know the State of the Union address just ended, about an hour, or some, ago. ... Biden, wear some pants?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a week since the Democratic Party was stung in the Massachusetts Senate special election race by the upset victory of Republican Scott Brown over challenger Uninspiry T. Nothington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that loss really got Republicans thinking about what Obama could do better. 'I think the only way he stops a Republican landslide in November is if he moves to the middle.' 'I hope he moves to the center and stops pursuing this extraordinary left wing agenda.' 'And he will move to the political center, I think he'll find a lot more Republican support.' What, wait, what? Wait, what?! Where is the Republican support in the center? Are...you talking about Lieberman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his State of the Union address tonight. For those...who didn't get a chance to see it, let me sum up what he said. Pretty much, he said, 'I can never do nothing in the White House! ... I thought it was going to be more fun, but everybody keeps talking about me. I hate 'em!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world champion Los Angeles Lakers visited the White House! ... They met President Obama this week and it was the first time a sitting president actually knew all the names of the NBA players... instead of referring to them as 'all those tall black buys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched President Obama's State of the Ruin, uh, State of the Union address?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in his speech, President Obama said, number one priority, saving jobs. His job, Joe Biden's, Harry Reid's, Nancy Pelosi's...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, he said that President Obama plans his budget a lot like the average American family -- spend like crazy, run up your credit card and worry about paying for it later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what annoys me? Republicans are all criticizing President Obama for using a...teleprompter when he gives a speech. Is that a big deal, using the teleprompter? You know, after...eight years of George Bush, I'm glad we have a president that can read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his latest audiotape, Osama bin Laden...said al Qaeda was going to bring down one of our older monuments. You know what that meant? It was Brett Favre. They were working with New Orleans, yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great Britain has proposed a half a billion dollar fund to create jobs for...Taliban members who agree to lay down their arms. The program is called 'Moolah for Mullahs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all watch the President's speech the other night? ... Hillary Clinton didn't attend the speech. .... She said today she would not serve another term as secretary of state. Apparently, she wants to do something else in 2012.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has proposed a freeze on government spending next year. ... Well, that sounds like the worst New Year's resolution, doesn't it? 'I'm going to quit drinking and smoking, next year. I'm going to lose 20 pounds next year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in London this week, a half a billion dollar British-American backed fund was proposed to pay Taliban fighters to lay down their weapons to stop fighting. ... So, the good news is America is creating jobs. Oh, sure, they're all for terrorists, but we're making jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released another tape. He released a tape today, blaming the United States for global warming. Well, you can tell he's running out of ideas. That's the best he's got? Hey, the United States blames the United States for global warming!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sounds like someone wants to quit al Qaeda and join Al Gore. I think that's what's going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, maybe it's not global warming that's affecting Osama bin Laden. Maybe it's the fact that he lives in a cave in the middle of a desert. Okay? That might ? 'Ooh, it's hot in here!' That might have something to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, scientists at UCLA announced they have discovered the lowest form of life -- John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elizabeth Edwards announced that she and John have separated. So, it looks like it's not just Nancy Pelosi that's going to lose the House this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, apparently it was something that was bothering Elizabeth. I think it was called a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in four years, Ford is reporting a profit of $2.7 billion. They attribute it to the fact that they are building better cars, and that Toyotas are crashing and Hondas are bursting into flames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard. Toyota having a big recall-a-thon! ... Recalling something like 2.3 million cars. The cars may suffer from unintended acceleration. The accelerator can stick to the floor, which is scary. In fact, some Priuses have been seen on the freeway going as high as 48 miles an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, Las Vegas has more foreclosures than any other city in the country. In fact, times are so tough; you know the casino New York, New York? They...changed their name to Newark, New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. J.D. Salinger, the reclusive author of 'The Catcher in the Rye', has passed away at the age of 91, after a long battle with teen angst. I just threw that one in for me. The show has been canceled. I like that joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released yet another audiotape message. Where does he find all these audiotapes, okay? You can't even buy audiotapes anymore.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Goldman Sachs' CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, is getting a $100 million bonus. Goldman Sachs denied it, saying, 'Well, no figure has been decided on yet.' You know what that means? He's getting more. Exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems John Edwards' mistress has gone to court to get a restraining order against the release of a sex tape she made with John Edwards.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when they hung Saddam Hussein? ... Well, you remember his buddy, Chemical Ali. ... Well, he got hanged over the weekend.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is the one that killed all the Kurds, Chemical Ali. He shouldn't be confused with the guy who killed NBC. That was Chemical Zucker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unfortunate. I heard that John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth have legally separated. ... Under the reasons for separation, Elizabeth Edwards just wrote 'see news.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's been talking about Barack Obama's first year in office. But did you also know this was George Bush's first year not in office? ... Bush has been doing a lot of speaking. ... He wowed 'em at the 'Get Motivated' seminar. Killed earlier this month at the Safari Club International Hunter's Convention. And -- this is the big one ? coming up, he's going to be the keynote speaker at the 2010 National Grocers Association Annual Conference of Supermarket Synergy Showcase! ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has announced his Administration's plan to build a new $8 billion dollar high-speed rail system. ... Have you ever ridden on Amtrak? We can't figure out how to keep a low-speed rail system from crashing, okay. Do you really want to go off the track at 150 miles an hour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC News reports that the president of Pakistan...slaughters a black goat every day since becoming president in an attempt to ward off the evil eye. It's good to see these modern, progressive people are our allies in the war against terror.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supposedly there is a John Edwards sex tape out there. Well, it's a tape of him and his mistress, Rielle Hunter, having sex. I don't know. Is that really news? A lawyer screwing somebody? Doesn't that happen every day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now, Rielle Hunter has a restraining order against the former Edwards&quot; aide &quot;who has the tape. Hunter claims...he stole the tape out of her hatbox. Her hatbox? When did they make this tape, 1955?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the wife of South Carolina governor Mark Sanford&quot; has &quot;written a book...about her whole ordeal. Remember, he went to Argentina to see his mistress? She says her husband kept pestering her for permission to see his mistress. See, that shows you how bad the Republicans are at cheating, okay. They ask permission. Republicans, stick to what they know -- greed. Leave adultery to Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a historical fact. It was on this day in 1690, the first paper...money was printed up in the colony of Massachusetts. The pilgrims realized that when they ran out of money, they could just print more. Thus, the Federal government was born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now coming out with the new, 75th addition of Monopoly, this time with a round board. No more square boards. ... And actually, they've updated the whole game. In the new version, the banker is a Wall Street CEO. He overextends mortgages, he loses the bank, and when things go under, he uses his get out of jail for free card. So it's all very realistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's having a big Super Bowl party. This is very shrewd. He has invited a group of Republicans to come to the White House for his Super Bowl party. He's going to seat the 'you lie' guy next to the 'not true' guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is very shrewd about bringing the Republicans into the White House for the Super Bowl party because he feels like if he can get them to pass the dip, maybe they'll pass healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told Obama, he said, 'Listen, you get 10 Republicans to show up, and I'll drop in and choke on a pretzel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's something interesting and important. The Pentagon now wants to allow gays to serve openly in the military. You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen? More parades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was Bill Clinton who popularized the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. But...don't confuse that with another Clinton policy ? 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell Hillary.' That was a whole different policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a town hall meeting in New Hampshire yesterday, President Obama said that using stimulus money to help schools is not sexy, but it's making a difference. Oddly enough, that's the same way he describes Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the town hall event, President Obama also said jobs will be our number one focus in 2010. He then added, 'Specifically, mine and Biden's jobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama also had some economic advice for the American people. He told them not to blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college. Though to be fair, most recent college graduates would probably have more luck in Vegas, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is really trying to bring people together. He told Senate Democrats that politics can't be just about scoring points. Then today, he was sued by the Knicks for stealing their motto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. Admiral Mike Mullen said it's wrong to force people to lie about who they are in order to serve their country. Then Congress was like, 'Who cares? We do that every election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is getting more angry criticism today. Boy, this guy can't get a break. Apparently, though, he told a group of high school kids in...New Hampshire, and I quote, 'When times are tough, you tighten your belts. You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash in Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize.' And needless to say, people in Vegas are extremely upset. In fact, the mayor of Las Vegas said the President is not welcome in Las Vegas. ... I happen to agree with the mayor. How dare the President tell high school kids not to blow their college money in Las Vegas. We're in a recession right now. What about Siegfried? What about Roy? What about their tigers? The tigers cannot survive on eating magicians alone. ... They need money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' could be a thing of the past, very soon. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, says he believes gays should serve in the military, all gays, whether they want to or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In last week's State of the Union address, President Barack Obama renewed his vow to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', the policy that keeps openly gay Americans from serving in the military. So that's from the commander-in-chief. Well what about military brass ? Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen? Well yesterday, they went before the Senate Armed Services Committee and stood tall. 'Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself and myself only, it is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do. No matter how I look at this issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.' Permission to get goose bumps, sir!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, folks, but I've got bad news. We Americans once had the greatest military in the world! But yesterday, it was viciously de-greatified. In a Senate hearing on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' the chairman of the joint chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, said this. 'It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do.' Time to run up the white flag, folks. Oh, but make sure it's rainbow colored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next thing we know, they'll be giving out Purple Hearts for being fabulous under fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately, a real military hero was there to reject the admiral's unwanted advances. 'I'm happy to say that we still have a Congress of the United States that...would have to pass a law to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', despite your efforts to repeal it, in many respects, by fiat.&quot; By Fiat?! With all due respect, Sen. McCain, it would most likely be by Subaru Outback.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, on this issue, McCain's got a life partner: Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who warned just what kind of deviant behavior gays in the military might lead to. 'Examples include alcohol use, adultery, fraternization, and body art.' He's right. What will happen if our brave sailors got tattoos, hung around with loose women, or drank alcohol?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know that America is hurting. ... Unemployment is over 10% and that doesn't even count everyone who's out of work. ... 'When you take into account what we call 'underemployment' ? that's Americans who are looking for full-time work but can't find it -- it comes up to about 17%.' And if you add people who have jobs but send spend most of the day on Facebook, it's up to the mid-90s.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just two weeks before he is scheduled to go to Nevada to campaign for Harry Reid, President Obama said Las Vegas is a place of excess that people should not visit during hard times.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the Super Bowl coming up Sunday?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is always a new Osama bin Laden video. And in this one, he's worried about global warming. ... And he's blaming the United States for global warming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, president Obama spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. On the 'Today' show, this morning, Michelle Obama said she likes having her mother live at the White House because she helps take care of Sasha and Malia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about what's going on with Toyota? This is crazy. It's like, their job is to make cars, right? ... Well, they had a problem with gas pedals getting stuck -- now, they're recalling the Prius because the brakes don't work. And because of this, sales of Ford cars and trucks rose 25% in the past month. But Ford says it's because of their new ad slogan, 'Ford, because Toyota is trying to kill you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in California is working on a new wireless monitor for pill bottles that tattles on you when you forget to take your medicine.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new research found that one in five people has an 'unfitness' gene, which makes them out of shape no matter how much they exercise.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has decided to skip the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. I think he's still mad they stiffed him in Chicago. But, they said it would be very expensive to arrange proper security for Obama, so they're sending Vice President Joe Biden in his place. Because, you know, who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President won't be at the Super Bowl either. In fact, in a show of some sort of spirit of cooperation, I guess, he's invited a group of top Republicans to watch the game with him at the White House on Sunday. ... That should be a lot of fun.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the second time since he became president, Barack Obama has slammed Las Vegas by saying, 'You don't blow bunch of cash in Vegas.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, what the President said was, 'If you want to gamble, drive a Toyota.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for Toyota. According to CNN, Toyota has known about this brake problem in its Prius cars for some time, but didn't mention it to people who bought them. What?! Car salesmen lying? I am stunned!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Australia announced that within five years they will be able to successfully carry out pig-to-human lung transplants. People could be part human, part pig. We have that already. I think it's called John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow...in Nashville, Sarah Palin will speak at the Tea Party Convention. Tickets are $550 apiece. ... Where are they getting this tea, Starbucks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin said she will not benefit from the speech. See, that way she'll have something in common with the people in the audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know anything about the new senator from the great state of Massachusetts? ... Senator Scott Brown. Comes out of nowhere, this guy. And he used to be, like, a go-go boy. That's where he got his start. And then he was a nude model, and now, he's a senator. Have you...seen the guy? Terribly good-looking.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we've got another one of those...videotapes from Osama bin Laden. I mean, they're coming like once a month now. It's like you're in a club. You sign up, you get the whole collection. Time-Life: Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in this one, he's blaming the United States for global warming. ... Says the United States caused global warming, and by gosh, they better stop global warming. Sounds to me like somebody's looking for a Nobel Prize, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very ecologically minded. Like, last year, it was documented by the CIA that Osama bin Laden switched to a hybrid camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was busy holding two fundraisers in DC last night. During one of his speeches, Obama told the crowd, 'We can't be afraid of the future.' ... Most Americans agree with him, mainly because they are so busy being afraid of the present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said, 'We can't be afraid of the future.' And Biden was like, 'What about clowns? Can we be afraid of clowns?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also said that the key to competing with China is to improve our math and science education. Because right now our GDP is about $13 trillion and China's is $3 trillion, which means we're still ahead by, uh -- trillions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tough out there. Even the Obama store in Washington, DC, is closing. That's where they sell t-shirts, hats, and calendars with Obama's face on them. You can tell they're Obama calendars. They only go up to 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on '20/20,' Barbara Walters sat down with the first lady of South Carolina, Jenny Sanford. Jenny Sanford is the estranged wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who, as you may recall, went AWOL to visit a mistress in Argentina last summer. His wife has a new book out. ... In the book, she says that when they got married, she agreed to let him remove the promise to be faithful from the wedding vows. See, now, that -- that should have been a clue right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also says the Governor was a bit of a cheapskate and for her birthday, he gave her a drawing of...half a bicycle. And then for Christmas, she got a drawing of the other half and a $25 used bike. And then another birthday, he bought her a diamond necklace and then boxed it back up and returned it to the store. Fiscally responsible, you have to admit that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first ever Tea Party Convention is going on right now in Nashville. The tea partiers are a group of Americans who think the government is too big and also like to party and have tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China and the United States have been locked into a series of trade disputes. President Obama said this week that China is putting US exports at a disadvantage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the New Orleans Saints. They defeated my Indianapolis Colts. ... So all I can say is, 'Don't worry, Indianapolis, FEMA is on the way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody snowed in the big blizzard? Like, over two feet, down there in Washington, DC. ... DC completely ground to a halt. ... Absolutely nothing going on. Well, how you can tell the difference?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Sarah Palin was speaking to a group called the Tea Party Group. ... And she received a hundred thousand dollars in payment. ... Now, of course, she was paid in pelts, but still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to go...to this Tea Party deal, it was a 350 bucks a plate. ... And if you wanted a glass or a cup, well, that was more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, Sarah Palin looked at notes written on her hand during a speech at the Tea Party Convention in Tennessee. Isn't that wild? Oddly enough, she was reading, 'Hi, I'm Sarah Palin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Super Bowl was not the only gathering of great Americans this weekend. The National Tea Party held their first convention in Nashville, Tennessee. ... The keynote address delivered by Fox News' own Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;believes Obama's hope and change...rhetoric is no match for her maverick-y, note card, hand-scribbled buzz words. ... You really need to remind yourself to 'Lift American Spirits?' Unless 'Lift American Spirits' is a note to steal a carton of cigarettes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Toyotas aren't the only thing crashing and burning right now. So is the Obama Presidency. ...

Even worse, they didn't phrase any of their questions in the form of a taser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was...a big weekend for Sarah Palin. She was in Nashville, giving a rousing speech&quot; to the &quot;National Tea Party Convention. ... 'This is about the people. And it's bigger than any king or queen of a tea party. And it's a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter.' ... Of course, folks, the blogo-chato-sphere has been giving Palin heat for zinging Obama over his teleprompter, just because she herself used a hand-o-prompter. ... Oh big deal! Writing notes on your hand shows she's an average Jane. Not like those elites and their memory!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Orleans Saints are the Super Bowl champs. ... The Indianapolis Colts, they're a great team, too, but...they didn't win. Did you see them?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, be glad you're not back East. Huge snowstorms. ... I don't think Washington has seen a snow job like this since that last stimulus package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, Nancy Pelosi had to sit in her driveway for ten minutes defrosting her eyeballs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, Sarah Palin had to cancel a speech because she didn't want to take her gloves off to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with all this snow, President Obama told all non-essential White House employees they didn't have to come in. Well, actually, just Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about the commercials for...Dockers? Where the guys in their underwear were singing, 'I'm wearing no pants.' I thought that was a new John Edwards for president campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started doing a little something that is mighty helpful. When I come out here to tell the jokes, I have them all written...in the palm of my hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got that idea from Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska. And when she goes out on a speaking engagement, she has her --- I think we have a photo here. Take a look. There's Sarah Palin. Can you see on her left hand? There it is. Get in real close: 'LensCrafters'; 'Clean Rifle'; 'Look at Russia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got a lot of snow in Washington, DC. And the city came to the biggest standstill...they've had since the Democrats got the supermajority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this President Obama, he had an idea about how to handle it. He's going to let the Democrats handle the snow. ... They'll put it on the back burner and hope it melts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now critics of the automobile industry are saying that Toyota executives knew about the problems with the brakes years and years ago. And they're wondering, rightly so, why did they drag their feet? Well, trying to stop the car. That's what they were doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just held his first monthly bipartisan meeting, and said that working together on jobs would be a good place to start. You know where else would have been a good place to start? A year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama just launched a campaign to combat childhood obesity called 'Let's Move.' And this evening, obese children started their own program called 'Let's Not.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you Sarah Palin at the Tea Party Convention on Saturday? Well, this is ? I'm starting to love her, really. She...mocked President Obama for using a teleprompter and then, someone noticed...she had notes written on her hand. And she had the words 'energy', 'budget', with the word 'cuts' crossed off, 'tax', and 'lift American spirits' written on her palm.... It lifted my spirits, so -- mission accomplished, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Writing stuff on your hand ? it's not a good idea. It's actually why President Bush...invaded Iraq instead of Iran. He wrote it down, I guess he played, like, nine holes of golf, and...now here we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe&quot; Sarah Palin would be &quot;smarter if she had bigger hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Sarah Palin is no dummy. This is actually a calculated move designed to promote her new book, 'Cheat Sheets and Moose Meats.' It's a collection of recipes that that you can write in moose blood right on your hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's also getting criticized&quot; because &quot;last week she demanded that Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, step down because he used the word retarded. But then, Rush Limbaugh did the same thing on his radio show and that, she said, was okay. Unfortunately, she's been unable to respond to the criticism because she's wearing mittens. ... Cold all over the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The East Coast is covered in snow right now. ... Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia got almost 35 inches over the weekend. And may get 20 more inches tomorrow. ... Schools and businesses were closed. They're building snow-bamas all over the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal government was shut down today, and...they estimate it cost about $100 million in lost productivity. The House is literally stuck in the House, and they can't do anything. ... I have to admit, it is nice to see lawmakers shoveling something else for a change, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most congressmen are actually...taking this opportunity with all the snow to spend some quality time with their mistresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, as you know it is Black History Month. .. Well, today I saw a bus ad&quot; that &quot;perfectly expresses how to best rejoice in the achievements of our black countrymen. 'Come and celebrate Black History Month with Heineken.' First off, I should probably explain to black people what Heineken is. It's a delicious European lager first brewed in Holland in 1864 and it is the drink of choice for white people when they're discussing whether they should have invited some black people to their party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Dutch beer is a natural compliment to celebrating African-American achievement. After all, if it weren't for the help of the Dutch merchants, there wouldn't even be African-Americans. They'd still just be Africans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're also celebrating another long-oppressed minority, corporations. The Supreme Court recently ruled that corporations have the right to make unlimited contributions to political ad campaigns. ... Now, I have always fought for freedom of corporate speech. That's why mine was the first presidential campaign to be sponsored by a snack chip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, last September, I predicted the country was headed for a glorious future. 'We can't stop with just freedom of speech. We must endow corporations with all the freedoms we flesh and blood people have been hogging for too long.... And if corporations are people, why can't we just cut out the middle man and elect President Microsoft Office Assistant Clippy?' He does have some great ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are you folks doing here? It's a snow day, for heaven's sake. I got up this morning, the first thing I did, I turned on the radio and listened for the talk show closings-- darn! And then I get a call from the guy at the office here, and I think, right away, somebody is calling me at home. They're not supposed to do that, must be trouble. And I said, 'What's wrong? Has the show canceled?' And the guy said, 'No, just checking in on the elderly.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, you woke up this morning, and New York, a tremendous sight. I mean, it was whiter...than a Tea Party rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People still talking about the Super Bowl. ... It was the most watched...TV program of all time. ... The second most-watched event was the episode of 'Dallas' where J.R. gets shot in the face by Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This President Obama, I mean, give the guy credit. ... He keeps working and working and working. ... He's going to invite a bunch of Republicans to have a televised debate on healthcare. ... It's going to be a big, big event. As a matter of fact, at halftime...The Who&quot; will &quot;be there doing a special song about Lipitor. So look for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, Bob Dylan performed at the White House&quot; in &quot;honor of Black History Month. Because when you think of black history, you think of a mumbling, white, Jewish guy from Minnesota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We learned last weekend&quot; that &quot;Sarah Palin...writes notes on her hand when she's giving speeches. ... You can see the notes right there on her hand. The first one is, 'Hitch up the dogsled,' 'buy Chapstick,' 'clean rifle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know why it is a good day today? I'll tell you why. Because the new credit card regulations start today. That's good news if you have credit card debt, like me. I racked up 50 grand on bedazzlers.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But starting today,&quot; the &quot;credit card companies have to scale back their evil ways. They can't raise or increase rates whenever they want.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't keep many credit cards because I'm worried someone might steal my identity. Yeah, right. Like anyone would want my identity. After two days, they'd beg me to take it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, to allay Republican fears that this 'summit' was a 's-e-t-u-p', the White House released details on February 12th, specifying who would be invited to the summit and what the format of the summit would be. And, after having 10 days to peruse that document, on February 22nd, Cynthia Lummis, Republican Wyoming, took to the floor of the House. 'Do we even know who's going to be in attendance at the summit? Do we know the format of that summit?' Wow! Either that lady doesn't have an Internet connection or staffers or -- she never learned how to read!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As difficult and contentious as this healthcare debate has been,&quot; there &quot;has been one big upshot.

Blackwater Worldwide,&quot; the &quot;State Department's largest security contractor,&quot; has &quot;been accused of hiring prostitutes with tax dollars and putting them on the company payroll.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talking about presidents who smoked. You remember George W. Bush? Remember him? He's saying while he was president he would enjoy the occasional cigar.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House announced a contest for high schools to have President Obama speak at their graduation. It's really exciting because so far, Obama has only given speeches at 70% of the nation's high schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys been following this recall stuff? It's getting totally out of hand. Now the Obama Administration might require all cars to have an override system in case the brake pedal doesn't work. Personally, I like the old override system, a tree.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'People' magazine has confirmed that former President Clinton called Tiger Woods to offer his support during the ordeal. For real. They have things in common, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a nice thing to do, a nice gesture between two, you know, kindred spirits. It actually reminds me of the time President Bush called Homer Simpson after Homer stapled his face to a doughnut.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I do hope you at home are sitting down, or if you're standing, at least have a bite stick in your teeth, because, the White House has dropped a bombshell. ... It is the result of President Obama's first physical since taking office. In it, the President's physician...recommends 'moderation in alcohol intake.' ... Folks, I tell you, we've ignored the warning signs. Beer summit? Hello! Clearly, he insulted that cop just for the excuse to pound a sixer of Old Milwaukee tall-boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President's clear, crippling alcoholism is just the tip of the bourbon-soaked ice cube here. Despite Obama's apparent health, the doctor also recommends he have a 'healthy diet' and 'up-to-date immunizations.' That means Obama is obese and has rabies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, his days are numbered. Okay? Get used to hearing the words 'President Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the pilots were stunned [at hearing a child direct air traffic]. One of them said, 'Am I still drunk or is that a kid's voice?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Gov. David Paterson &quot;said he will not run for election but he will serve his full term. He's going to finish his term.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's more crazy news coming out of the auto industry. Today, Nissan recalled over half a million cars with faulty brakes and fuel gauges. Toyota was like, 'just half a million? Oh, that's cute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove's new memoir, 'Courage and Consequence,' is coming out next week. Not sure if 'Courage and Consequence' is how most people would describe the Bush years but, I guess, it does sound better than 'Oopsies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Britain have developed a new camera that can identify a terrorist by the shape of their nose. Yeah, it's all part of the new technology called 'racism.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the last week, on principle, Republican Senator Jim Bunning singlehandedly held up emergency funding of unemployment benefits for millions of people on principle. ... I thought he stood for something, but last night, he caved in to bipartisan pressure which broke the stalemate and my heart. ... I'm sure it was hard to be universally reviled as a half-witted, egomaniacal sociopath, but doing the right thing is never easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Goldman Sachs has been making a killing off Greece by selling credit default swaps which are essentially bets that Greece will go bust. I hear Goldman has inside information that Greece is hiding its debt. This is what CEO Lloyd Blankfein meant when he said Goldman Sachs was, quote, 'doing God's work.' Specifically the God Hades by dragging the European economy to hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for the auto industry. General Motors announced this week they're recalling 1.3 million compact cars here in North America to address a power steering problem. Apparently, since President Obama took over the company, all the cars are veering to the left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Texas voters overwhelmingly nominated former Houston Mayor Bill White over Pakistani-born businessman Farouk Shami. Who could have seen that coming? Imagine Texans choosing a white guy named white over a Pakistani born businessman named Farouk Shami. It's like the world is upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the government officially clarified exactly what the word organic means. It now means three times more expensive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former governor George W. Bush is writing a book, writing a book. How about that, about his eight years in the White House. It's all part of his war on literacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president George W. Bush is &quot;busy hard at work writing his memoirs down there at his home in Texas, Rancho Inepto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a memoir by George W. Bush and because I'm telling you, if there is one thing you really want to do now, if you are like me, and God I pray you're not like me, but if there's one thing you want to do, is get a nice fire going and curl up with a big book and relive the Bush administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends have been said [to former president George W. Bush] 'Jeez, congratulations, Mr. President, we didn't know you had a book deal, we didn't know you were going to write a book. We didn't know you were writing your memoirs or any of this.' And they said 'Are you using a ghostwriter?' And the former president said 'No, the guy's still alive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has teamed up with the guy who created 'The Apprentice' and they're going around trying to sell a reality show.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I heard this, Sarah Palin, somebody said Sarah Palin is getting a reality show. I said 'Reality show, jeez, what about a reality check?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More crazy news from the car industry. An executive at GM is blaming his company's 1.3 million car recall on a parts supplier owned by Toyota. I'm just waiting for people to start blaming everything on Toyota. It's like the unemployment rate, the Kennedy assassination, global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a big story out of Washington. The Senate voted against a plan to send a $250 check to 57 million elderly people. In the end, senators decided not give the elderly money, because you know, they're just going to spend it on drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty wild, Sarah Palin has been shopping around her own reality show. Yeah. of Course, any reality show about Sarah Palin will have to compete with that other reality show about Sarah Palin: the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a story today in the entertainment trade papers that Sarah Palin is shopping a reality show with the producer of 'Survivor', Mark Burnett. That's why she quit being the governor of Alaska. I find it strange that Sarah Palin would be shopping a reality show considering the fact that she hasn't shown much interest in reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama talked to Congress about healthcare. He said, 'Just get it done.' See, that's when you know things are bad, okay? When the President of the United States is quoting Larry the Cable Guy. 'Git er done!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, this year, they expanded the Best Picture category to include 10 films. In fact, even the death montage -- they expanded that to include President Obama's healthcare plan. Did you notice that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? President Obama had a meeting at the White House with Jay-Z and Beyonce. And, in fact, they hit it off so well, Jay-Z gave the President his own rap name, 'Biggie Deficit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. Just four days after being arrested for driving drunk while leaving a gay bar with a man, California state Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview in 'Time' magazine, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer -- I love this -- he said that having sex with hookers...is not nearly as bad as having an affair. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone watch the Oscars last night? ... Big night for 'The Hurt Locker', which of course is a film about the war in Iraq, which, I guess explains why Obama called the director and was like, 'How did you end it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's been really busy, you guys. He's making his final push on healthcare reform.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is cool. President Obama is going to hold a major space conference to unveil an ambitious new plan for NASA. Obama called it 'one small step for man, one giant distraction from healthcare, two wars, and the recession.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

The 6th through the 10th, or possibly April 12th is a possibility. April 12th, 2025 will definitely be the date. If not then, 2027.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massa... goes on the Glenn Beck show and he says that he was having a birthday party tickling his staff. ... And he said one guy couldn't breathe, he was tickling him so hard. And then Dick Cheney said, 'Well, we should have done that at Gitmo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now this Congressman Eric Massa...is claiming that he was bullied in a gym by Rahm Emmanuel. The President's guy is bullying him in a gym, naked.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massa just keeps getting into more and more trouble. ... One of Massa's former shipmates in the Navy says that he used to give his subordinates massages.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Eric Massa was living in a house in DC with a bunch of young single male staffers. Massa described the house as 'just a bunch of guys doing guy stuff', while the male staffers described it as a 'den of awkwardness.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove's memoir, 'Courage and Consequence', is the best-selling book on Amazon.com. The book costs $19.99, and comes with free shipping and mishandling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our president, Barack Obama, has been working on reforming our healthcare system for the better part of the past 300 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been some ups -- the passing of the House version of the bill, the passing of the Senate version of the bill. There have been some downs, mainly downs. There have been a lot of downs. ... You know, even the House and Senate bills were downs, actually. This has really been like the Quaalude of bills. It's been a lot of downs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now we enter Healthcare Reform 2.0: The Final Confrontation. 'President Obama back in campaign mode.' 'The last big push to try to pass healthcare reform.' 'All the marbles. All he can muster. One last shot. One final pitch. This is it.' That's the most ridiculous news intro I've ever seen in my...life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're acting like it's the Civil War and he's firing on Fort Sumter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may know, earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Israel to reignite peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians raising the question: Who will subvert the peace process this time? ... Of course, the...smart money's on Biden. The Administration sends Gaffemaster Flash to Israel. Seems like a risky play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, you know I love Karl Rove. I cannot get enough of this guy. Sometimes when I can't find him on TV, I'll just put a pair of wire-rimmed glasses on a loaf of ham, and...I'll pretend we're friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl's fun. That's why I am so pumped that on Tuesday, Karl Rove dropped his new book, 'Courage and Consequence.' It's just like 'Pride &amp; Prejudice,' but even more prejudiced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I am loving...the juicy details in this little book, okay? ... Like Karl's shocking revelation that he had nothing to do with the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Oh, and the bombshell that it wasn't him who spread the rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black baby. ... And, folks, you'll never guess who was really not behind the swift boat rumors about John Kerry. ... I am telling you, folks, this is a gripping 'who-didn't-dun-it?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, spoiler alert: Bush was a great president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, all this week I have been covering the Democrats' healthcare jihad. Now I know reconciliation is a confusing issue, and I know when you're confused, you're angry. And I certainly hope I've added to your confusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming on the Ides of March. You know, this is March 15th. It was on this day in 44 BC, Julius Caesar met his end. ... He was stabbed in the back by members of the Senate, ironically, while pleading for healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama, turning up the pressure on Congress to pass this healthcare reform. In fact, he's telling Democrats, if they don't vote for this bill, he will go out and campaign for them in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the 'Journal of Neurology' reports that the longer you smoke, the less likely you are to develop Parkinson's disease. ... So what are they telling us? Follow me guys. Remember, a couple of months ago, doctors said drinking a glass of alcohol every day...was good for your heart. Smoking prevents Parkinson's disease. Marijuana is good for glaucoma. Sex is good for your prostate. You know, screw healthcare. Let's party!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech to the Export/Import Bank's annual gathering, President Obama announced that he will establish two brain trusts to double US exports over the next five years. You know what our leading export is right now? ... Jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, learning more and more about that homegrown terrorist, that woman, Colleen LaRose, also known as Jihad Jane. They're calling her the most dangerous person to come out of Pennsylvania since Ben Roethlisberger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in World News, the tension between the White House and Israel at its highest level in 30 years. Israel wants to build more houses in its territory and the Obama Administration wants them torn down. Here's the solution: You build the houses but let Countrywide give everybody an adjustable rate mortgage. They'll be foreclosed on and out of there by July.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as part of an art project, 31 life-sized nude male statues will be set up all around Manhattan. They're so lifelike, former Congressman Eric Massa tried to tickle three of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Toyota's defense, there are allegations that the driver of that runaway Prius in San Diego may have faked it. ... The guy claims he couldn't stop a runaway Prius? Come on. Tiger Woods' wife stopped a runaway Cadillac Escalade with a nine-iron, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody changed their clocks this weekend for...daylight savings. So you move it ahead. And even the Taliban move their clocks ahead. They moved it up to the 11th century. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well here's something interesting. And I guess this goes with the job. President Obama announced over the weekend that he get 20,000 letters a day...calling him an idiot. And I said, 'Hey, welcome to the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to myself, 'Well hey, maybe I am presidential material.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in all fairness, a lot of those letters come from Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his weekly radio and Internet address, President Obama called for an overhaul of the 'No Child Left Behind' law. It will now be called 'The World Needs Janitors, Too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama talked about healthcare reform at a senior center in Strongsville, Ohio, today. The most common question he got: 'When's bingo?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this yesterday on 'Meet the Press.' Tom Brokaw referred to...healthcare reform as a 'kerfuffle.' You thought passing healthcare was hard; ten times harder for Brokaw to pronounce 'kerfuffle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, folks. ... If I have a little less zazz than usual, you can thank the merchants of chaos responsible for daylight savings time. ... Now if I...end up getting in a fight with the tick-tock men, you know who I want on my side? Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy. Last Wednesday, he lit up Capitol Hill. ... 'We're talking about Eric Massa 24-7 on the TV. We're talking about war and peace, $3 billion, a thousand lives, and no press?! No press! The press of the United States is not covering the most significant issue of national importance and that's the laying of lives down in the nation for the service of our country. There's one, two press people in this gallery!' That tirade was way outta line. Those two members of the press were trying to sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the specific legislation being ignored...by the press was Dennis Kucinich's resolution to pull troops out of Afghanistan within 30 days. Now, while that May seem like an implausible fantasy, remember, the press did report on Kucinich's presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota is starting to fight back. Today, they cast doubt on the story of that guy -- remember the guy last week that said his Prius accelerated out of control on the freeway? They said they found significant inconsistencies in his story. And let me tell you something, that's embarrassing when a car dealer calls you a liar.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you're on the freeway, you know how to tell if a Prius next to you is out of control? Here's how you tell. If you look over and the driver's face goes from that smug, 'I'm saving the environment' look, to the frightened, 'get me the hell out of here' look, that's kind of how you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm sure you remembered to turn your clock ahead an hour, unless, of course, you're a Democrat working on healthcare. Then you might want to turn it back a year and start all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was thinking about this healthcare problem. If you took all the money the Republicans have spent to stop healthcare and all the money Democrats have spent trying to get healthcare, we could afford healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in 'GQ' magazine, John Edwards' mistress...said she slept with him on the first day they met, but she wasn't his mistress, she was just playing the role. ... And, apparently, the audition went so well, she got the job!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rielle Hunter told 'GQ' that she will love John Edwards until death do us part, to which Elizabeth Edwards said, 'You know, I can arrange that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also said in the interview she did not consider the money she got every month from the Edwards campaign as hush money. .. Well, duh. Once you give an interview, it's no longer hush money. It's now considered down the drain money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is getting ready to vote on President Obama's healthcare bill. It's going to be a close vote. ... The House Democrats say it could be a real tickle fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, out in Arizona, is campaigning with John McCain. He's running for Senate re-election. They're campaigning together out there. I thought, yeah, I mean, there's an unbeatable combination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys see the 'GQ' pictures of John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter? ... Today, she called them 'repulsive', and says she trusted 'GQ&quot;s photographer to take classy photos. Yeah, because anytime I'm on a bed in nothing but dress shirt and underwear next to a Dora the Explorer doll, I think, 'This is gonna look classy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a beautiful day here in New York for the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Over 60 degrees outside. I guess that's just luck of the old global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich announced that he will vote for President Obama's healthcare bill. ... The one condition is that Obama had to carry him on his shoulders so he could see the St. Patrick's Day Parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top officials believe that Kim Jong-Il is going to die in the next three years. I was going to send him something, but Hallmark was all out of 'heard experts are predicting your death' cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much! Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' Oh, man. You sound like a bunch of congressmen lining up to get all your freebies to vote yes on healthcare.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, that's the big thing. The big healthcare vote, ladies and gentlemen. You know, it's going to be close. In fact, did you hear President Obama's new slogan? 'Hope this works!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it's starting to get nasty. Today, Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner got in such a heated argument, Boehner missed his appointment at the tanning salon, and she missed her appointment for Botox injections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the mother of that homegrown terrorist, the one they call 'Jihad Jane,' says her daughter only joined a terrorist group because she was lonely and wanted someone to love her. Well, that, and the fact that she thought eHarmony was just too creepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, the head of the CIA, Leon Panetta, says that Osama bin Laden has been driven deeper and deeper into hiding. The guy's already living in a cave. How much deeper is he going? Is he in a mine shaft?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's now being reported by the 'Wall Street Journal' that Bernard Madoff was assaulted in prison back in December over a dispute over money. I'm stunned. What? Over money? Bernie? I can't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities are investigating this Madoff attack, and they have narrowed the suspects down to everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it said in the paper he was treated for a broken nose, fractured ribs, and cuts to his head and face. The good news for him, of course, he's in prison. So, he gets free healthcare. The bad news for us, we're paying for it. We get screwed again by this guy. Now we're paying for his healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In France, people are appalled that contestants in a fake game show were willing to repeatedly torture a man by giving him what they thought was electric shock until the guy was dead. The show was called 'Be Dick Cheney For A Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys enjoying March Madness? I am so pumped for this weekend. My friends are coming over. We're going to pound some beers, paint our faces, and watch the healthcare vote go down on CSPAN. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some movie news. 'Repo Men' came out today, starring Jude Law as a guy who rips out your internal organs if you can't pay for them. Or, as we call it in the US, 'your insurance company.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of health insurance, the Democrats are working overtime to get 216 votes to pass healthcare on Sunday, which means Rahm Emanuel is prowling the showers like the head of a prison gang. 'You guys vote yet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of upsets over the weekend. Kansas lost to Northern Iowa. Georgetown lost to Ohio. Republicans lost to the Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, healthcare reform was passed by the House last night. Supporters of the bill say the American people now get the same health benefits members of Congress get, which is great. See, if we can just get some of those other perks, the free travel, the envelopes with the cash in them, the get out of free jail cards, oh, all of that could be great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, not a single Republican voted for the healthcare bill. They claim the US government isn't qualified to be in the healthcare business. Hey, kept Dick Cheney alive the last 30 years. It's got to be worth something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who's going to be in charge of healthcare? The IRS. No, this is true. The IRS will be in charge of enforcing the new healthcare laws. You thought you hated getting audited by the government? Wait until they're in charge of your prostate exam, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're getting more details on what happened in the White House after the vote. In fact, the minute it passed, Joe Biden, he was speechless. So, right there the bill is already paying dividends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And before the vote, protestors on Capitol Hill heckled Nancy Pelosi. But she managed to keep a stiff upper lip, as well as a tightly stretched forehead, and an unnaturally arched eyebrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said last night this proves this is a government of the people, and by the people, except for the 55% of the people who opposed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, and the nice thing is, if you lose your job, you know, you're still covered...which is great news for the Democrats in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced, for the first time in the Navy's history, women will be allowed to serve on submarines. See, the problem before was...they didn't want men and women spending time together in such unbelievably cramped quarters. And then they realized, 'Wait a minute, it's no different than flying Southwest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Gallup poll, Congress' approval rating is at an all-time low, 16%. Only 16% of Americans think Congress is doing a good job. The other 84% didn't get any bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the famous jeweler, Tiffany &amp; Company, announced their fourth quarter profits were quadruple what they were this time last year. Experts say it's either a sign the economy is improving or more guys are getting caught cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday...in Washington, DC, history was made. ... Congress actually worked on a Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress passed the healthcare reform bill. Well, that was easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are unhappy about the healthcare bill. ... Americans love paying sky-high medical bills. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democrats were thrilled, as you can guess. And they got a little rowdy, as Democrats can do. ... They tipped over Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama won one of the great ? they're calling it ? the 'great legislative victories of the last 50 years' last night. He won healthcare reform approval to extend coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, or as the Republicans are calling it, 'Armageddon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anti-healthcare reform protesters outside the Capitol were down right vicious. They yelled the...n-word at black legislators. They yelled the f-word at gay legislators, the w-word at Latino legislators. It was like the 'Sesame Street' of hate out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think it's great. Maybe now, I can finally get a gynecologist to see me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the season premier of season 10 of 'Dancing with the Stars.' It's a smaller cast,&quot; including Buzz Aldrin, whose wife commented &quot;on his chances to win. 'I don't think people realize Buzz is a risk taker.' They don't? He went to the moon, you know, first. In a Toyota, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Buzz Aldrin, by the way, is 80 years old. How crazy would it be if one of the first men on the moon was killed in a dancing accident?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show'! ... Here's my gift to you. You all have healthcare! It's all on me! You got it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, President Obama signed the landmark healthcare reform bill into law, or as President Obama refers to it, 'The Rush Limbaugh Deportation Act.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, boy, he's feeling like a Toyota driver today. There's no stopping him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how excited the President is. Today, he changed his slogan from 'Yes we can,' to 'Yes we finally did something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the White House is now denying it made any side deals with members of Congress to pass this bill. See, I don't know if that's true. Did you see Mount Rushmore today? They're adding Dennis Kucinich's face to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this all couldn't have been done without the help of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. And today, the President thanked her for her unblinking support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Nancy Pelosi used the Internet to help gain support for this. She reached out to people on her favorite social networking site, Icantmovemyfacebook.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to help sell this plan to the American people, President Obama said it's the same plan Congress has. See, I think that's a mistake. I think that's why a lot of people opposed it. Have you seen members of Congress? Do they look healthy to you? Anybody here want to be as fat as Barney Frank? Huh? You want to be as orange as John Boehner? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, a lot of right wingers are very upset...about this because they believe this healthcare bill will cost a lot of money. You know what I think? Just pretend it's another unnecessary war. You'll feel better about it already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants rallied across the country demanding a path to citizenship. Don't we have a path to citizenship? It's called the San Diego freeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon is changing Army basic training for the first time in 30 years to deal with the fact that so many new recruits are so overweight. ... In fact, the Army's new slogan, 'Don't ask, no seconds.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You people are in such a great mood. I really appreciate it because on a day like this, it's lousy weather. ... Here in New York City, it was 49 and gloomy. You know, like Glenn Beck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks happy about the healthcare bill reform that the Congress has passed? Some people are unhappy about it. A lot of people unhappy about it. Here are two reasons I'm unhappy about it. One, I love paying huge money for healthcare. ... And the other thing, I used to love driving to Canada to buy cheap drugs. I loved that too. I am steamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been very divisive. The Republicans are thinking, 'Okay, all right. We didn't think this was going to go the way it went. Now we really got to get something together. We have to put our heads to this.' They've come up with a great plan that they think has legislative viability to repeal the healthcare reform bill. You know what it is? Four words. Four words. Hot tub time machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about basketball? Anybody here suffering from March Madness? ... Well, don't worry. It's covered by the new healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't let people lie to you. We're not out of this recession. Anybody here think we're out of the recession? No, we're not out of it. We have no money. No jobs. The recession is still going strong. More trouble for the United States economy. The US debt now may lose its triple-A rating. And I said to myself, 'Well, who cares what the auto club thinks?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's coming up is the 2010 Census form. You have to pick up your census form. There will be some changes. First of all, when you hear the Census, you think, oh, please, mind your own business. But you can't have that attitude. You've got to pick up the census form and fill it out. There's changes in the form this year. For example, under gender...you have your choice -- male, female, or gaga. ... It's a third category.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to include everybody in your house. For example, you must include people, even people who just sleep part-time in your house. They have to be included on the Census form. Like Sandra Bullock's husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of a day is it for you? Because I think it is a great day for America! It is. And I'll tell you why. ... Because all day today...Ben and Jerry's was giving out free ice cream. ... And Starbucks was giving out free pastries. Everybody's getting cocky now that there's free health insurance. ... Eat what you like. Diabetes? Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what your political party, this week we saw a great American do something many said couldn't be done. That's right. Buzz Aldrin did the cha-cha on 'Dancing with the Stars,' and that was just something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you guys know, this morning, President Obama signed the healthcare bill into law. ... I know it's exciting, but I still think it was inappropriate to sign it, 'President Barack 'Suck It' Obama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After signing the bill, Obama hugged Nancy Pelosi, twice. He called her one of the best speakers the House has ever had. And then he called Harry Reid one of the best majority leaders the Senate has ever had. Obama is either really excited about healthcare or totally wasted. 'I love you. I'm serious. You're the best. You guys are the best.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hawaii wants to be the location for President Obama's presidential library because that's where he was born and raised. But really, when you go to Hawaii, the first thought that comes to your mind is, 'I got to hit the library,' isn't it? So, it's kind of perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, President Obama signed into law the healthcare bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on Sunday. ... The Republican Party is not happy about the bill. Sen. John McCain told a radio show yesterday that the bill was done in quote, 'the most unsavory Chicago sausage-making' that he's seen in all his years. First of all, I can say from experience that there is nothing unsavory about Chicago sausage. It couldn't be more savory, in fact. And that's not a liberal or conservative point of view. That's an American statement right there, a fat American statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain also said that there will be no cooperation from Republicans for the rest of the year. So that should be good for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a shame to see all that cooperating end, you know? This is like the coyote announcing he's no longer cooperating with the road runner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of crazy. I don't know if I believe this. A new Harris poll found that 57% of Republicans believe President Obama is a Muslim ? 57%. Forty-five percent believe he was not born in the United States. Thirty-eight percent feel he's, quote, 'doing many of the things that Hitler did.' And 24% believe he may be the Antichrist. Oh, like Oprah would date the Antichrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's ridiculous: 38%...believe he's like Hitler? How is that possible? He doesn't even have a mustache. How could he be like Hitler? Did Hitler play basketball? No, seriously, did Hitler play basketball?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have the way to pay for healthcare. ... A cuss jar. Every time Joe Biden says the f-word, he has to put a dollar in it. ... It pays for itself in a week.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, when Joe Biden was introducing the President of the United States, he said the f-word into an open microphone. And you know, people make a big deal about it, but if you think about it, this is probably the least embarrassing thing Biden has said since becoming Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama didn't seem that bothered by it. ... The only f-word that's banned in the White House, of course, is Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Men's Health' magazine...21% of men surveyed would rather have a sexier nurse than a more competent doctor when they're in the hospital. ... I say, why not have both? The government's paying for it now. Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin spoke out this week against the healthcare reform bill, saying, 'Elections have consequences.' Well, of course, elections have consequences. That's why right now, instead of being Vice President of the United States, she's trying to get a reality show on the Animal Planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something amazing. A North Carolina jury, this week, awarded $9 million to a jilted wife, from the other woman. The other woman has to pay $9 million to the wife for breaking up her marriage. Wait, do you realize how historic this is? Guys, for the first time in history, women are agreeing it's not the guy's fault. It's her fault! ... This is what men have been saying for years. Poor John Edwards. He was tricked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, hey, are you ready for the...2010 Census? It's going to be complicated this year. So the government should have patience. Here's part of the problem. Most Americans count as two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you filled out a Census form. Here's the deal. Ten questions in ten minutes. That's what they're saying. ... Coincidentally, that is how John McCain chose his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You got to count everybody in your household for the Census. Right now, Angelina Jolie is going through the place with one of those clickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you missed it, at the healthcare bill signing yesterday, Vice President Joe Biden introduced the President, then turned to him and said, 'This is a big f'ing deal.' ... Joe Biden, C-SPAN shouldn't have bloopers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama's out on the road selling his healthcare plan to the American people. One of the biggest criticisms of this almost 3,000 page bill is it's so complicated, it's so complex, nobody really understands it. To give you an idea of how confusing this healthcare bill is, more Americans now understand the plot of 'Lost.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, in Arizona, John McCain and Sarah Palin appeared together at a campaign rally. Sarah Palin gave her standard stump speech, which means you ask her a question and she's stumped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know why she's at this campaign rally? Well, it's kind of sad. They still haven't told McCain the election is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. At a breakfast panel discussion hosted by the US Capitol Historical Society, Texas US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison...said women senators do not cheat on their husbands because they don't have the time. That's what I love about politicians. There's no moral problem with adultery, it's just a matter of scheduling and multitasking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was at a bookstore in Iowa yesterday, and he bought a $37 pop-up book for Press Secretary Robert Gibbs' son.

Yes, I am calling collect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he was at the bookstore, Obama also picked up books by Mitt Romney and Karl Rove and held them up to the media. And then he made their author photos make out for like five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan this past weekend. I guess after the last 14 months in Washington, he wanted to go someplace where there was less fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty quick trip. In fact, it happened so fast, Joe Biden didn't even have a chance to say something stupid about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a rough couple of weeks for Vice President Joe Biden. First he blessed the Irish prime minister's dead mother, who was not dead. ... Then he used the f-word when he introduced the President. Finally some good news. Over the weekend, Joe Biden was nominated for the Dan Quayle Lifetime Achievement Award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, as you know, the people have spoken, but healthcare passed anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is now preparing to pass yet another jobs bill. You know how to create more jobs in this country? Fire the people that wrote the first jobs bill. That obviously didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released a new audiotape in which he threatens to kill Americans. You know, as opposed to his earlier, new age motivational tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the FBI is now saying that al Qaeda may be planning an attack on a US sports stadium. See, I don't think al Qaeda, though, has any idea about our sports. You know what their big plan is? To hit Wrigley Field during the World Series.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over in Afghanistan, the US military is now using...pilotless drones to attack al Qaeda. Do you know what those are? It's a plane that doesn't have any pilot. It's flown by remote control by somebody on the ground. Or as Southwest calls that, 'the next step.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin had a weekend for her: Changing diapers; opening up jars of baby food; cutting meat into little pieces. Just another day campaigning with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And unemployment in Florida hit a record high of 12.2 percent. You want to know how bad it is down there? Today, the Coast Guard picked up 50 Cubans off the coast of Miami trying to swim back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of President Obama's Trip To Afghanistan: &quot;10. The welcoming chants of 'death to America!' 9. Using miles to get bumped up to business class. 8.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? President Obama, big surprise visit to see the folks in Afghanistan. Did you read all about that? That's kind of exciting. It turns out he was shooting an episode of 'Undercover Boss.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He met with...Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, but Karzai was late for the meeting. ... You know why he was late for the meeting? He had transportation trouble. ... The accelerator on his camel...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was an important meeting. Both presidents agreed that we have to work to wipe out terror networks. Get rid of terror networks, like al Qaeda, the Taliban, Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama demanded more accountability. He said we got to have more accountability, we got to have a crackdown on corruption; we have to have a better government. And he said if it works...in Afghanistan, we're going to try it back home in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is out campaigning now again? John McCain and his buddy Sarah Palin. ... I mean, come on, it worked so well the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...was campaigning in a, you know, a motorcycle jacket. ... She looks like somebody Jesse James would date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Governor Sarah Palin has been very busy. She's been campaigning for select Republicans, including John McCain, who's in the middle of a tough Senate race in Arizona. How does he introduce her? 'And now, the young woman who cost me the Presidency, Sarah Palin!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare's free now! ... America as we know it is dead. You now who else is dead? Your nana and your peepop. Don't believe me? Well maybe you'll believe the friendly friends over at 'Fox and Friends.' 'It's not a scene out of a Hitchcock movie. It's reality at a retirement community. Hundreds of vultures taking up residence at the Sun City Community in...Texas.' Vultures circling the elderly! ... Clearly...these guys have heard about Obama's death panels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's a...fascinating story. And this kind of thing happens all the time. But every time it happens, we always say, 'Whoa, here we go.' ... The Republican National Committee had a big party at some kind of a sex club in Los Angeles. They spent $2,000 of campaign donation money on the bill at the sex club in Los Angeles. ... But the guy who organized the big Republican sex party...apologized on the Golf Channel, so that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the 'Today' show this morning, President Obama said that adjustments will need to be made to the new healthcare law. In fact, it's getting so many adjustments, Obama's now calling it the Heidi Montag of congressional bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the same interview, President Obama said that his family has decided not to join any one, single church, because he causes too much of a disruption at services. ... At the last service, the priest was like, 'In the name of the Father, the Son and holy cow, the President!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thursday is Census deadline day. ... The census would like every resident of the United States to fill out their form and mail it in. If you don't know how many people live in your house, just count the number of iPods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And remember, you know, the Census Bureau sends a Census taker to any home that doesn't reply by mail. So unless you want to have a conversation with another human being, you better get that in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain, a year and a half ago he was on top. His party's candidate for president. He plucked an unknown Alaska governor to be Eliza Doolittle to his Henry Higgins. Smash cut to today. McCain struggling to retain a narrow lead in a surprisingly tight Senate primary against arch-conservative talk show host J.D. Hayworth. Yes! That J.D. Hayworth. The one you've never heard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the problem. No matter what Sarah Palin is saying about John McCain, she can't help but make him look bad. Just by sitting next to her. ... No matter what she's saying, she's full of life and vibrant. The viewer at home's not even listening. It just sounds like this to them: 'Yeah, I found this man wandering at the mall. If he looks familiar to anyone, please contact me.' ... You know, the whole thing, it just doesn't look right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Most extensive exploratory undertaking since Harry Smith's colonoscopy. 5. What? What? Ricky Martin's gay? 4. Fifty barrels of oil reserved each year for Mitt Romney's hair ? zing! 3.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a fascinating story. The Republican National Committee got together and said, 'You know, boys, things are going so well for us here lately, let's have a party.' So...they said, 'Well, yeah, but we don't want to pay for it.' And they said, 'No ... We'll get the Republican National Committee to pay for it -- money that we get from donations and contributions. We'll let the folks pay for it.' And everybody said, 'Great, what do we do?' And they said, 'Well, let's go to Los Angeles to a sex club.' And they said, 'Great!' So they end up there at a bondage club in Los Angeles. ... And I thought...that makes perfect sense&quot; because Republicans &quot;love tying things up: Healthcare, you know; climate control; financial reform...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my favorite story of the week. The Republican National Committee is in trouble after spending nearly $2,000 at a...bondage club in Hollywood. You know what I call a Republican that spends a lot of money in a strip club? A Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is interesting. President Obama unveiled a new gas mileage program that he says is like taking 58 million cars off the road for an entire year. Or as Toyota calls it, 'business as usual.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More car news. Ford is teaming up with Microsoft to create an all electric car called the Microsoft Hohm. That's smart, because if there's one company that knows how to avoid crashes, it's Microsoft.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, a 7.2 earthquake hit southwest of Tijuana. ... They say the earthquake was felt by 20 million Mexicans and that was just here in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news. The United States and Russia have signed a historic nuclear weapons treaty. Apparently, Russia is getting a little nervous. ... They heard we had successfully mounted a warhead on a Toyota Prius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, last week was charged with public drunkenness after cops caught him giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a flattened, roadkill opossum. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS says it's been getting death threats since the healthcare bill passed because the IRS is going to be the ones in charge of implementing it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, Sarah Palin gave a speech in Nevada where she criticized President Barack Obama for being a constitutional law professor. ..

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals home opener against the Philadelphia Phillies. And then Vice President Joe Biden was thrown out for cursing at the umpire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama didn't actually...throw the ball. He got it to the catcher's mitt through a series of back door dealings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals game. Obama took a short windup and threw a high-arcing pitch. Of course, Democrats saw the pitch as moderately close to the middle, while Republicans are calling it 'way to the left and possibly socialist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, a prominent Filipino businessman quit his job at a major university after admitting that he made a speech plagiarizing Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and J.K.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President and Mrs. Obama hosted the annual White House Easter Egg Roll today. Dozens of children gathered on the White House lawn to roll eggs towards a finish line while the President cheered them on and Republicans tried to block them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, Michelle Obama's pet project is raising awareness of childhood obesity, so they didn't just roll eggs this year. They rolled a few fat kids to make an example of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then later this afternoon, the President threw out the first pitch at the season opener for the Washington Nationals. You know, baseball has started again.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisely, the President decided to donate those lady pants to the Smithsonian. And today, he sported a pair of gray slacks. The pants were better but the pitch wasn't. That was more like a free throw than a pitch. Maybe his pitching power was stored in that pair of mom jeans, and now, like Samson without his pony tail, his strength is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare reform isn't perfect...but perhaps the one change we can all agree is a positive step is that now insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children with preexisting medical conditions. ... 'Some insurance companies believe they have already found a loophole.' But why?! Why are you looking?! You may have found it, but why would you look for a loophole for that? Are you worried that when you go to hell, you'd only be taking the local and you want to make sure you're going to be on the express?&quot;</SPAN></P>

Did you see that? That was John Paul Stevens actually throwing a pitch out with the Cubs when he was 85 years old. Not for nothing, can we get the split screen of Stevens' pitch with Obama's from last week. Ninety-year-old man, Mr. President. Fired a heater down the middle.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman named Sue Lowden&quot; is a 'Republican...running for the Senate in Nevada. You know this healthcare thing? The Republicans are against it. She says one of the ways you can keep the cost of your healthcare down is to barter with your doctor. You know, trade with him. That's a great idea. But what if your doctor is not Amish? Okay, what do you do then?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pentagon, al Qaeda is in financial ruin. Good. I think that's called al Karma.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody. Yes, it is! But not a great day for our former Vice President Al Gore. He was ambushed for interview by Fox News. ... What's wrong with you Fox News? You don't ambush him. If you want to get Al Gore for interview, you don't have to ambush him. Just leave trail of ham into studio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced that, in 2012, he's going to hold his next nuclear security summit at a site in South Korea, right near the North Korean border. Seriously? That's like if you held a biker chick rally right across the street from Jesse James' rehab facility. You're asking for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of North Korea, I just read about a state-run comedy show in North Korea where the audience is ordered to laugh. ... It's called 'Funny or Actually Die.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may have another Oprah on our hands. Since leaving her job as the governor of Alaska...Sarah Palin has made more than $12 million. That is a lot of money for someone who can't say words that end in g.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they say $12 million is conservative estimate. She may have made a lot more, and yet, she continues to blame Obama for the bad economy. It seems -- weird, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figure is a little bit misleading because most of that money is Alaskan currency, which is primarily made up of pelts and shiny rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are like most Americans, you're watching this show right now in a motel room, because you're on the road with the Tea Party Express as it travels across the country to its final event on April 15 in Washington DC. But concern over the Tea Party's image have led some of the event's organizers to send out this email, requesting that Tea Partiers refrain from 'violence', 'profanity', 'bigotry', 'law-breaking', drinking 'or pre-drinking'. ... I have to say, uh, this whole event sounds kind of lame now. Like it's going to be an actual tea party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, praise the lord and pass the Guacamole because America is back. ... It says so...on the cover of 'Newsweek.' 'America's Back.' ... The magazine industry, however, still dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only a year ago that I didn't bother to understand what was happening, and now, it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes...the future looks bright, but that doesn't mean we can forget our past. In fact, we need to re-remember it. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell agrees with me. That's why he declared April 'Confederate History Month,' which is why this month, bumper stickers will read, 'Virginia is for Lovers of Embarrassing Chapters in American History.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the media, for some reason, can only focus on what Governor McDonnell initially left out of his declaration. 'I'm talking about that proclamation by Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, the proclamation that failed to even mention the cause of the Civil War.' 'Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia making April Confederate History Month, but not mentioning anything about slavery.' Hey, there are only 30 days in April. Day 31 would have been 'Mention Slavery Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a week later, he caved in to the forces of 'Big Slave' and shamefully sullied the heritage of the Confederacy with historical accuracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, lest we forget, we still have a war going on in Afghanistan, and unfortunately the situation there is getting worse for American troops. 'At the end of the month, Burger King, Popeyes, and Pizza Hut are getting their discharge papers when a fast food ban takes effect at bases in Afghanistan.' What?! Without deep-fried food, will they even remember what they're fighting for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And don't tell me these food deliveries are taking up cargo space that could be used for ammunition. I'm sure we could kill the Taliban with P'Zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration's top science and technology official has warned the United States cannot expect to be number one in science and technology forever. Did you know we were number one now? If we're number one in technology, why do I have to call India for tech support, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says that al Qaeda is now in financial ruin. I tell you, Goldman Sachs, they screwed everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, al Qaeda should have seen it coming. You know who's in charge of the finances? Osama ben Bernanke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' America may experience a serious doctor shortage. ... Does that mean we don't have enough doctors or we don't have enough serious doctors? 'I like my doctor, he's just not very serious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is launching a new $6 billion space policy that will ultimately take astronauts to Mars. Of course, it's six billion and $45 if the astronauts have a carry-on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama says the new $6 billion program will let us engage in deeper space exploration, while Biden says this will let us engage in open dialogue with Alf.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yahoo is producing a daily video series, based on its most popular news stories, in partnership with Toyota. Of course, they're having a tough time getting the site up because it always ends up crashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, our attorney general...said he's going to investigate whether a university foundation that hired Sarah Palin to give a speech violated public disclosure laws. They had some controversy. Some students found her contract rider in a dumpster.&quot; That is &quot;a list of demands a performer has when they appear somewhere. Usually you see them for, like, rock stars, but Sarah Palin has one, I guess. ... Among other things,&quot; Palin's rider &quot;requires two first class tickets from Alaska or a private jet from Alaska, nothing smaller than a Lear 60, and it has to have a window she can shoot out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has to have three hotel rooms, a wooden podium, not Plexiglas, two bottles of water, and best of all, I think, a supply of bendable straws. This is a complicated woman. On one hand, you know, she'll blow a moose's head off at 300 yards, but on the other, bendy straws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Obama will be in Florida to announce his vision for America's space program. The rumor is that he is going to reverse President Bush's space policy, which centered around sending a giant caulk gun to the moon to fill all the craters up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, sent a letter to Obama criticizing him because he's expected to cut funding for manned space flights. And he even helped spearhead this ad campaign that I guess is designed to convince President Obama to change his mind on this. ... 'For nearly half a century, the United States has been a world leader in exploring the final frontier: First to the moon, inspiring a nation, and paving the way for countless advancements in science. President Obama's plan to cut NASA's budget means never again will Americans see astronauts suck Jell-O through a straw, eat floating bananas, or doing funny experiments with a frog. Write President Obama. Don't let these super fun times come to an end. This message paid for by astronauts who love super fun times in space.' Powerful stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Palin continues her whistle stop tour of Realmerica, eventual ex-President Obama continues to arrogantly defy his lack of a mandate by doing things. 'In Washington tonight, 47 world leaders have gathered for a summit on the most serious of topics -- nuclear security.' ... This meeting of was called to find the way to eliminate the threat posed by nuclear weapons. It was the most heads of states convened by a US president since the U.N. General Assembly was established more than 60 years ago. And what was that assembly's very first resolution? It was, I kid you not, the establishment 'of a commission to deal with' the 'elimination of atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, I just want you to know, the main goal for Obama's meeting was to try and get an agreement on sanctions against Iran. That, did not happen. Did anything? 'The first statement that we heard yesterday from Ukraine, that it would eliminate over 150 kilograms of highly enriched uranium.' ... All right, so, several bit of significant news out of the summit. I wonder which piece America's number one news network will focus on. 'If you look at the nuclear security summit logo, what does that have in common with all those other flags there representing Muslim nations?' They're round? They...have, like, round shapes? They're all on the same screen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'That's the same thing that you see on the flags of Turkey, Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan. And what do they all have in common? They're all Muslim nations. So his claim is that the President deliberately put this as a logo to try and continue his outreach to Muslim nations in a positive way. So you be the judge.' ... We called the White House to find out the genesis of the nuclear summit logo. ... They say that the inspiration for the logo is actually the Rutherford?Bohr model of the atom that we all learned about in high school. So...it turns out&quot; the &quot;people at the White House are not secret Muslims. They're nerds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you probably heard about this on the news. Now being reported that the terrorist organization al Qaeda is in financial ruin. ... To give you an idea what bad shape they're in, today I saw a terrorist buying a shoe bomb at Payless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, do you know this story? Toyota has stopped selling their Lexus SUV because it poses a high risk of rolling over. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a Tea Party rally in Boston yesterday, Sarah Palin praised the crowd for winning that Senate race in Massachusetts. She said, 'Shoot, look at what you did in January. You shook up the United States Senate.' Unfortunately, no one heard the Senate thing, because after she said 'shoot,' 300 guns went off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the same rally, Sarah Palin said, 'Let me ask you, Massachusetts. Do you love your freedom?' ... Is anyone going to say 'no' to that? It's like going to a Phish show and saying, 'Anyone here like getting high and eating grilled cheese?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the conservative Tea Party political movement that's been, if not sweeping the nation, certainly sweeping the nation's news coverage, is doing that because it has everything the media loves, from charismatic leaders backseat presidentin' to middle American Main Street cred, from colorful costumes to a compellingly divisive narrative, and of course, the occasional...idiot. 'Obama lied, our country died.' ... Worst Dr. Seuss book ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, as a Libertarian, I believe the government has very few legitimate roles -- national defense and not asking what's hidden at my compound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I do have a bit of soft spot for one government program ? the space program. In fact, you know, when the weather gets warm like this, I just like to lean back and look up and just drink all that in. Isn't that beautiful? And now just imagine there's no concrete ceiling in the way. That'd be pretty nice, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why last week I drew a space-line in the moon dust over Obama's plan to scale back the space program. 'President Obama's 2011 budget scraps the Constellation program. Nation, this is the end of manned American spaceflight. The very last shuttle launch is this September. What are they going to do with all those shuttles? Convert them into a chain of theme restaurants called Cr?pe Canaveral?' Although, I would love to try an Apollo-pe?o popper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well guess who's riding my coattails? First man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, last man on the moon, Eugene Cernan, and Apollo 13's Jim Lovell, who published a letter criticizing Obama's decision. He is really catching major heat over cutting funding for NASA. ... Evidently, Barack Obama felt the heat I was bringing. Today, he gave a speech at the Kennedy Space Center. 'Nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space, than I am. By the mid 2030's, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.' I saved the space program!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so stupid. I made a huge mistake. ... I sent my taxes to Russia and my adopted kid to the IRS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The volcanic ash from Iceland disrupted air travel all over Europe. Everything's grounded. Commercial flights. Private jets. The only thing still flying -- Toyotas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, a big setback for NASA. President Obama cutting the space program of sending men to the moon. ... . Although he can point to one big achievement during his time in office. We did put an astronaut on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials now say that the two most senior leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq have been killed in a joint US-Iraqi mission. I believe the names were 'what's his face' and 'the guy who plays the guy who replaced the guy we killed last week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, we can't take all the credit. What happened was the Lexus GX 460 rolled over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to sources at the Pentagon, al Qaeda is nearing financial ruin. But ironically, their top people still got their million dollar bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda is broke. How ironic is that? Al Qaeda would run out of moolah. Isn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is going on with Goldman Sucks? Goldman Sachs. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just four day after Goldman Sachs cost investors $12 billion by failing to tell them that they're being investigated for fraud, they gave out another $5.4 billion in bonuses. Huh? Even Somali pirates are going, 'Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's an amazing fact. Sarah Palin made $12 million last year. ... In fact, Sarah Palin had such a good year, she was actually able to quit her part-time job as governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry king has filed for divorce. ... The...rumor going around is that Larry's wife left him for a younger man, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am aware that the only reason you people are here tonight is volcanic ash. ... Thank God I still have my swine flu mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry King getting another divorce. ... Had an affair with his sister-in-law but in his defense -- there is always another side to the story -- in his defense, at his age, you know, it's hard to remember which sister he's married to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Airports from London to Warsaw are on their sixth day of shutdown. ... The airports are closed because a volcano is erupting. Smoke and ash are spreading over Europe. The smoke cloud is big and thick. Meteorologists originally thought it was coming from Willie Nelson's tour bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, the volcano on the tiny island of Iceland has shut down air traffic. ... President Obama had to cancel his trip to Poland. President Obama said he hopes the volcano will stop smoking soon and the volcano said the same thing about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we've all got to make some cash fast, folks, because Obama is determined to destroy Wall Street with his oppressive financial regulations, all in the name of protecting the consumer from risky investments. ... Thankfully, folks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell got all 41 Republican senators to sign a letter opposing the bill. Because this bill is broken, folks. Just listen to Massachusetts senator and human-truck hybrid Scott Brown passionately explain to a reporter exactly what Brown would fix in this bill. 'Well, what areas do you think should be fixed? I mean, you know, tell me.' Truly a man of his convictions, once you tell him what they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But just when it looked like the Republicans had stopped this bill dead, Obama's Security and Exchange Commission dropped this bombshell. 'The story everybody is talking about tonight is, of course, Goldman Sachs, the original 'too big to fail' firm. The mega firm was charged with fraud by the SEC.' Why are government employees filing a civil suit against Goldman Sachs? That's just going to be embarrassing in a few years, when they all go back to work at Goldman Sachs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the liberal media always, always gets a charge out of attacking Goldman Sachs. In 'Rolling Stone', Matt Taibbi called Goldman '...a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity...' Wrong, Matt. Goldman is not a vampire. It also feeds during the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what, what exactly did the Feds accuse Goldman of doing here? Ali Velshi, CNN's business reporter from our raceless, hairless future explains. 'Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs is accused of selling mortgage-backed securities that were essentially set up to lose money. Allegedly, the deals were put together in part by a hedge fund tycoon who was betting against them.' What's the problem? There's nothing illegal about selling customers a product designed to fail. The Chicago Cubs do it every year. Are they going to jail? No, I do not think that they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, here's how it allegedly worked -- allegedly: An independent hedge fund manager named John Paulson created an investment made up of mortgage bonds he believed would fail. Goldman agreed to sell this to investors, like German banks and pension funds, without telling them it was crap. Meanwhile, Goldman bought insurance betting against the bonds, and when they failed, like they knew it would, Goldman and Paulson cashed in and then celebrated by stepping on a baby's throat. It's okay. ... They also took out insurance on the baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story everyone is talking about is Iceland and the eruption of their volcano, Eyjafjallajokull, which evidently is Icelandic for 'you will be sleeping in the airport.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Flights all over Europe are cancelled, and the airlines are losing roughly $200 million a day, so financially, they're doing better than usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama and a group of prominent Democrats proposed a solution to the erupting volcano. They want to pour money into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was here in LA last night and had a fundraiser: $35,000 a couple. I was trying to figure this out. President Obama played golf for the 32nd time in his Presidency, sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions to Wall Street -- Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president. You got one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just four days after Goldman Sachs -- or 'Goldman Sucks,' I guess you'd call it -- cost investors $12 billion, not million, $12 billion, by failing to tell it was being investigated for fraud, it gave out another $5.4 billion in bonuses. You know what they got the bonuses for? For hiding the fact that it was being investigated for fraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Pentagon, al Qaeda is in financial ruin. And as a result, some of the terrorists are so depressed, they have lost the will to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Robert Cheruiyot of Kenya. He won the 114th running of the Boston Marathon yesterday.... And of course, since the guy from Kenya won, well now, the Republicans are demanding to see his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Goldman Sachs Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Huh?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. You're saying 'fraud' like it's a bad thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Planned on using money to buy everyone in America delicious KFC Double Down sandwich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Distraught over George Lopez's move to midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. We were framed by evil menswear company Goldman Slacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since when are financial institutions not allowed to screw their customers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Hey sport, how much to make these questions go away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. America needed a villain both Republicans and Democrats can hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Everyone we ripped off got an 'I Got Cheated By Goldman Sachs' tote bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Uhh, it's Obama's fault?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody from Iceland? Well, it's volcano season up there. ... And the big volcano cloud...blowing now toward Russia. As a matter of fact, Sarah Palin says she can see it from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great day for America&quot; but &quot;another bad day for...air travel. A second giant smoke cloud shooting into the sky. Air traffic controllers say it's no longer safe to fly anywhere near Woody Harrelson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ballad of the unstoppable monkey continues. ... There's a monkey in Florida that escaped from somewhere. Nobody seems to know where. But it's been running wild for a year. No one can catch it. They tried to trap it. They shot it with darts, to no avail. See, that's the thing about Florida. If this happened in Alaska, the monkey would be hanging on Sarah Palin's wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since their beginning, the Tea Party's been accused of racism. 'The Tea Party in general is overwhelmingly white.' 'Is the Tea Party for white folks only?' 'The conservative movement has now crystallized into the white power movement.' That is slander, Miss Garofalo! Tea Partiers aren't white. They're just average Joes, regular Norman Rockwell, hard working, blue collar types who wear SPF 50 and shoot free throws underhand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they only want one thing. 'We're taking our country back.' 'They want their country back.' 'It's about taking back our country.' Yes, it's our country, not theirs, and we are taking it back from them. You know, them -- those people who steal. There's nothing racist about it. Just some of them steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the liberal media have seized on a few isolated incidents to make all Tea Partiers look bad. For instance,&quot; on &quot;March 20th, three black congressmen, including civil rights leader John Lewis, claimed a group of Tea Party protesters called them the N-word. Now, I'm not a racist, so I don't know what the N-word is. Okay, I'm going to go with niblets. First off, that sounds delicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And second off, they're clearly lying. 'There's no tape with the N-word on it. There's no ? wait! Let's be clear. There's no tape!' 'It's not on tape.' 'There is no tape of it.' No tape! And racists always tape their racial slurs. You don't want to forget baby's first N-word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, guess who else is calling the Tea Party white? Facts. A 'New York Times' poll of Tea Partiers show they are 89% white people and 1% black people, with margin of error of black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the government said today Somali pirates being held in US custody will be brought to the United States for prosecution and they will be tried by a jury of their peers. So I'm guessing that's what, Goldman Sachs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this on the news? Gay and lesbian activists chained themselves to the White House fence to protest the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. And when Republican Party officials saw the lesbians chaining themselves to the fence, out of force of habit, they paid $2,000 to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that fewer and fewer immigrants are sending money they earn here back home. They'd like to but there's no one left at home. They all live here now. They just send it across the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is rather disturbing. A government panel made up of all retired military personnel says that the school lunches are a threat to our national security because they make our kids too fat to serve the country. It's unbelievable. Remember the old days, when the Army wanted the best and the brightest? Now they're stuck with the biggest and the widest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something great. General Motors today paid back all the government loans five years ahead of schedule. ... Amazing what hard work, careful planning, and Toyotas rolling over and crashing into trees can do for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And unemployment here in California, over 12% now. ... Give you an idea how bad it is, you know the best way to make money in California now? Marrying and divorcing Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an interview on the 'Today' show, Bill Clinton told Jenna Bush Hager, who's...George Bush's daughter, that his only involvement in the planning of his daughter Chelsea's wedding is paying the bill. ... Although, since he's a Democrat, he doesn't actually pay the bill himself, he leaves it for future generations of Americans. But you get the idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talking about air travel and the volcano. The good news, ladies and gentlemen, regular airline service is resuming. ... The bad news -- regular airline service is resuming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The airlines lost $2 billion. ... Usually all they lose is my luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was 4/20, known to stoners around the country as National Weed Day. There were pro-marijuana legalization rallies all around the country, especially here in California, where freedom fighters like this guy exercised their right to free speech vigorously. 'Here in the meadow, people were chilling out. Some, maybe too much.' 'We're here just to have a bunch of fun in a field.' That's a good way to spend a Tuesday, while your parents are paying tuition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our British brethren will soon go to the polls to determine whether Tory David Cameron, Labor's Gordon Brown, or the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg will have the privilege of acquiescing to whatever demand is made of them to benefit American interests. Ha-ha! Someone has to say it! USA! USA! USA!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has yet to fulfill his promise that he would end the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' ban on gay service members. It's a fact he was reminded of when he spoke in California earlier this week on behalf of Sen. Barbara Boxer. 'She's passionate about fighting for California's families.' 'End 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot; 'She is ? we are do ? we are going to do that. Hey, hold on a second. Hold on a second. We are going to do that. ... When you've got an ally like Barbara Boxer and you've got an ally like me, who are standing for the same thing, then you don't know exactly why you've got to holler, because we already hear you.' ... You don't know why liberal activists have to holler? You don't spend much time with you liberal activists, do you? Hollering is their inside voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They use it when ordering chai. 'What do we want? Soy milk! When do we want it? Whenever you can deliver it in an environmentally sustainable fashion!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, on the Republican side, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is talking about cooperating with Democrat Chuck Schumer on a compromise plan to reform immigration laws. It's angered activists on the right, like this fella, speaking at a Tea Party rally in Graham's home state of South Carolina over the weekend. 'I don't care about your private life, Lindsey. But as our US senator, I need to figure out why you're trying to sell out your own countrymen, and I need to make sure you being gay isn't it.' Did you just link the possibility of Lindsey Graham being gay to being the reason he wants to reform immigration law? You know gay's not a nationality, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think Lindsey Graham is encouraging looser immigration laws so that his fellow natives of Gayslyvania can sneak across the rainbow bridge for a better life?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I don't know anything about Lindsey Graham's sexuality. I don't care. But this guy should know he's playing a dangerous game here. Everyone knows if a Republican comes out of a closet and sees a gay shadow, it means six more years of a Democratic administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it is Immigrant Heritage Week here in New York City, when New Yorkers honor each other's unique cultural ways of avoiding eye contact on the subway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this celebration reminds us that despite our different backgrounds, there is one belief that unites all Americans -- the Mexicans are coming!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you may not be hearing much about it now, but after the banking bill, immigration reform will be the next topico muy caliente en Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with Wall Street executives today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in the SEC, or as they call it now, the 'Sexual Exchange Commission.' Do you know about this? ... This is unbelievable. New reports showed that during that last big economic crisis, you know, the whole meltdown thing, employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission used government computers to look at porn. And, ironically, while they were looking at pornography, the other employees were watching Goldman Sachs screw the entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, President Obama gave a speech in New York City about his plan to reform these rules on Wall Street, you know? And one embarrassing moment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you probably heard about this. Both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden took some heat for flying separately to New York City last week because it was Earth Day, and they got heat for flying on two separate planes. Though in fairness, they can't fly together because of security reasons. Or at least that's what Obama told Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest anti-immigration bill into law. It's unbelievable. It makes it a crime as a state law to be in the country illegally. It lets&quot; police &quot;question anyone about their status. You know what this means? Rich people in Arizona may have to start raising their own children now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an unbelievable law. And it's already starting to backfire. Today, a group of Native Americans pulled over a bunch of white guys and said, 'Let's see your papers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Treasury unveiled their new version of the $100 bill last week. They needed to come out with a new one because, apparently, China has all the old ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China now considering easing up on that policy one child per family law they have down there. For years, they have only allowed one child per household. Now, a factory -- well that can have as many children as they need.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'What? Ricky Martin's gay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Do you spell nucular with 2 'o's or an 'e-w'?.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Shouldn't Cheney be the one writing this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush is writing his memoir. Writing his autobiography about his eight years in the White House. He's not done with it yet, but he's already put up the mission accomplished banner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publisher...says that in the book, Bush writes honestly and directly...about his flaws and mistakes. ... And I'm thinking, whew! Man, this is going to be a long book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened today down in Washington, DC? ... The...world champion New York Yankees visited the White House. ... Oh, you know who was not there from the championship team? Kate Hudson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a beautiful day. President Obama charged them $25...for a hot dog and a warm beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was quite a change for the New York Yankees, going from 'The House That Ruth Built' to 'The House That Bush Wrecked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, the Yankees, they're champions. In Arizona, they would be deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a nice story. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle took the weekend off. ... They went hiking in North Carolina. ... Had a great time. And so he wouldn't get lost,&quot; Obama &quot;left behind a trail of cigarette butts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's...nice when a politician says he's hiking the Appalachian Trail and he actually is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's memoir is coming out November 9th. ... On the cover, Bush is wearing a dark suit and holding a briefing book with his head slightly turned from the camera, or as Bush calls it, 'posing all serious- like.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the book is called 'Decision Points', and 1,000 signed, cloth-bound copies will be sold for $350 each. Each...one&quot; will say, &quot;'Thanks for reading about my decisions. Sincerely, Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush's memoirs going to be titled 'Decision Points.' That sounds like the reward system that was used to get Bush to do things when he was in office, doesn't it? 'So, if I sign that paper with the law on it, how many decision points do I get? Like, five decision points, six? Last Wednesday, I got a silver star and a smiley face.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with the Yankees to congratulate them on their World Series win. ... The New York Yankees' Derek Jeter said, 'You never get tired of meeting the President.' And then John McCain said, 'I'm pretty much over it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arizona...recently passed the toughest anti-immigration bill in American history. The idea behind this bill is to drive...illegal immigrants out of Arizona and back to their homeland of Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called the governor's office in Arizona today, and the recorded message said press one for English, press two for English, press three for English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new law is pretty strict. You can't use the slogan 'what can brown do for you?' anymore. Can't even use that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ironically, after they passed this new law, you know how they celebrated at the statehouse? Shots of tequila.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The top executive of Goldman Sachs testified before Congress today,&quot; which &quot;proves crooks always return to the scene of the crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So today you had lawyers, congressmen, and bankers in the same room. That's like the trifecta of lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the cover story of this week's 'Newsweek' magazine is about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and how President Obama sends her out to crack down on misbehaving world leaders. Gee, I wonder where she learned...to do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was an announced today that President Bush's book will be released November 9th. The book will be called 'Decision Points.' It will be centered on 14 decisions President Bush made during his Presidency. See, this should silence the critics who claim Dick Cheney made all of the decisions. This book will prove&quot; Bush &quot;made at least 14 of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Arizona? ... They have that new tough immigration law, and they say now because they're getting a lot of reaction, they're saying it isn't targeted to Mexicans. The immigration law, they said, is not about keeping Mexicans south of the border. As a matter of fact, they had a crew out today a government agents looking for Dutch people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain supported Arizona's new immigration bill. John McCain, also an immigrant. ... He came over on the Mayflower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, this is good. Going to be ready for you in November. Going to be in bookstores in November. It's George W. Bush's memoir. ... It's about 14 key decisions that George W. Bush made in his life. ... For example, his decision to move Jay to 10:00 p.m.&quot; is &quot;covered in the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book will be ready in November. Bush is making last minute revisions right now. ... As a matter of fact, his computer screen is covered with whiteouts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the publisher says that the book contains quite a discussion about all of the mistakes that he made and all of the problems and all of the trouble that he caused. Boy, that will be a long book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And his wife, Laura Bush, also has written a book. They're going to be published at the same time. Both have memoirs. Her story and his story. I was thinking, well, whose book would you rather read? The one by the librarian or the one by the guy who choked on a pretzel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are we surprised that these people are thieves? Their names -- sacks, gold; what does that say?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has now voted against giving itself a pay raise. They thought giving themselves a pay raise now would be unpopular. Really? ... I think giving them any pay at all right now is unpopular. ... Forget the raise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's national security adviser...has apologized for telling an ethnic joke during a speech in Washington. ... Political insiders were shocked...somebody said something stupid, inappropriate, and it wasn't Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man on a Delta flight from Paris to Atlanta claimed to have explosives in his luggage, forcing the plane to land in Bangor, Maine. Fortunately the plane was never in any danger. Because it's Delta, they lost the luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush, got his new memoir coming out in November, and it's called 'Decision Points.' ... It's about big decisions in his life. And I've already made a decision not to buy 'Decision Points.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they said to the former president, 'Did you use a ghostwriter?' And he said, 'No, the guy's still alive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona is very defensive about&quot; its &quot;new immigration law. ... They said, 'Wait a minute. This is just not about Mexicans.' ... So earlier today, they were out rounding up Swedes and Finns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, was on 'Oprah' today. ... She told Oprah she did not believe that she played a central role in the breakup of the Edwards' marriage. Really? So, getting pregnant by a married guy, having his kid, that's not what broke up the marriage? You know what broke it up? Fighting over the remote. ... I'm sure that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is this woman on 'Oprah'? Shouldn't she be On 'Maury Povich'? ... 'John Edwards, you are the father!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of that big oil rig fire down there in the Gulf of Mexico, it's now leaking oil into the gulf at a rate of 210,000 gallons of oil a day. ... That is the equivalent of 10 buckets of fried chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House's top budget director -- a man named Peter Orszag -- warned that out of control deficits will mortgage our future to foreign creditors. Now, of course, people were stunned when they heard this. 'What? The White House has a budget director? Where has he been?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the world renowned physicist, Stephen Hawking, you know that guy? He says in his documentary, aliens do exist, but he says it's best we do not try to interact with them. In fact, he's against giving them driver's licenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, Arizona has passed the strictest immigration law in the country and in response the mayor of San Francisco is pushing for a boycott of the state of Arizona. ... This could be devastating to gay rodeos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not the only ones boycotting. Today, Mexican gangs are threatening to cut off the state's drug supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger here tonight. In fact, in a week from now, he'll issue his annual Cinco de Mayo message. Well, see, that shows you how different California is. An Austrian governor who speaks English with a German accent congratulating Spanish-speaking people before they drive their Japanese cars to work in a factory owned by the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Publishers announced...that former President George Bush's book will be released November 9th. The book is called 'Decision Points.' The title is based on the fact whenever a decision needed to be made, Bush would point to Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a show on CBS called 'The Mentalist.' ... It's about a...detective&quot; with &quot;heightened powers of observation. ... Let me give you an example of how good this guy is. This guy is so good, he can tell the difference between a Goldman Sachs executive that is a lying crook and a Goldman Sachs executive that's a lying weasel. He's that good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, this oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, boy, it just keeps getting worse and worse. They're now calling it the greatest threat to New Orleans since, I guess, George W. Bush was president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the government sent...all these resources to help clean up this massive oil spill. Do you know what they should send to soak up that oil? Italian bread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They sent specialists down there to start a controlled fire on the ocean to burn the oil off, which they say is helping. That's when you know things are bad, when the ocean on fire is an improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad an ecological disaster this is, today, the volcano in Iceland told BP Oil, 'You win. We can't compete. You guys are so much better at this polluting thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on 'Oprah' yesterday, John Edwards' former mistress...said she doesn't see herself as a home wrecker or a gold digger. You know, I agree. I think she's more like both.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She does not see herself as a home wrecker. Well no, not compared to Countrywide Mortgage maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, a lot of people are now boycotting Arizona products. Here's how stupid it is. People are now boycotting Arizona Iced Tea, which is actually made in New York City. This is true. It's not even made in Arizona. But that's irrelevant according to the boycott organizers -- Snapple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine has named Glenn Beck one of the hundred most influential people in the world. They also asked Sarah Palin, also a member of the top 100, to write an article praising Beck. So see that, two wrongs can make it on the right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know -- this is pretty serious -- somebody tried to detonate an SUV rigged with explosives in Times Square. SUV turned out&quot; to be &quot;a Nissan Pathfinder. Probably, the bombing suspect realized if he'd been driving a Toyota, he would have been putting his own life in danger.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say if this SUV bomb had gone off, it could have caused almost as much damage to New York City as Goldman Sachs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the oil from that oil rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico...spewing five times as much oil&quot; as &quot;first was estimated. ... When former President George w. Bush heard about this, he said, 'Wait a minute. You mean we have oil here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, British Petroleum said they're doing everything they can to control this leak. Really? Two hundred thousand gallons? That's a leak? ... The pipe under my bathroom. That's a leak, okay? ... This is a gusher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the environmental impact from this is unbelievable. They say a lot of birds are trying to leave the area. ... And, today, Arizona issued a warning -- any birds flying in from out of state will be stopped and arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arizona has passed the strictest immigration law in the country. It's scaring everybody. In fact, today, Taco Bell changed their name to Skippy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, announced he is quitting the Republican Party to run for the Senate as an independent. And today, it became official -- the Republicans took away his lesbian strip club VIP card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten British Petroleum Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'The Gulf of Mexico was overdue for its 3,000-mile oil change.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'We promise we'll get around to it by Labor Day.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Relax, it's only leaking 210,000 gallons a day.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Giving everyone a free BP travel mug.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Louisiana hasn't had a disaster in five years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Guy from Goldman Sachs said it would make money.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Blame FEMA.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Did you hear Ricky Martin's gay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Blame Toyota.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Honestly, we're so reckless -- surprised it took this long.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody from the Gulf of Mexico area? ... It's going to be the biggest ecological disaster on the history of the planet. And today, a tourist thought they saw a blowfish in the Gulf of Mexico. Turned out to be a flounder holding its breath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum says that they have a plan now to clean up the vast...oil spill. ... You know what it is? Hot tub time machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something very suspicious happened over the weekend.&quot; A &quot;car parked at, like, 45th and Broadway, very suspicious. ... And I'll tell you the most suspicious thing about the whole episode was that the guy found a parking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God the car bombing was thwarted by an alert carjacker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian dictator, Ahmadinejad, is in town. ... So for one day, Mayor Bloomberg is not the shortest dictator in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad...has got a busy schedule. Today it is the UN. And then tomorrow, he's going to be on 'The Rachael Ray Show', filleting a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, of course, down there in Washington DC, they had the big White House Correspondents' Dinner. Do you know who was really funny? President Obama. ... So funny in fact he has already been promised 'The Tonight Show' in five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, there were huge marches to protest Arizona's new immigration law. ... If you don't know, Arizona's new law says police have to ask anyone for immigration papers if reasonable suspicion can be found that they're in the country illegally. ... But what's reasonable suspicion? One Arizona lawmaker said, 'Illegal immigrants are easy to spot because of their clothes.' Really? I know it was obvious with me when I got off the plane because I was wearing Speedos, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you guys been following the whole oil disaster? ... Yesterday, President Obama said, 'Let me be clear. BP is responsible for this leak. BP will be paying the bill.' And BP was like, 'Ah, bailout? Right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Arizona...is the subject of a lot of controversy because of this new immigration law they passed. There were big demonstrations all around the country yesterday protesting it. Many people believe it's potentially racist, but the state announced today that despite the controversy, they're still planning to move ahead with their annual Cinco de Mayo party. I guess it's sort of a going away thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if I was Latino, I don't...think I would go to this. ... 'Don't worry. Get on these buses. We'll take you to the party. It'll be a lot of fun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past Saturday, New York Police disarmed a car bomb in the middle of Times Square. .... Luckily, Mayor Michael Bloomberg rushed to the scene to fill in the public. 'At about 6:30...last night, an alert t-shirt vendor who is a Vietnam veteran noticed an unoccupied, suspicious vehicle. He alerted police officer Wayne Rhatigan of the NYPD Mounted Unit, who was on his horse, Miggs, patrolling Times Square.' I'm sorry. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! Uh, John Stewart, 'Daily Show.' What type of vendor and what war did he serve in? And...what was the name of the horse? And...do you have any information that matters?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the main thing to remember is that this tragedy was averted. The bomb did not detonate, but don't worry. The news media is going to make sure that the still at large bomber will get it right next time. 'It's well known that in trying to put together that kind of a bomb that you have to mix it with fuel oil.' 'He did not buy the ammonium nitrate, which could have caused a humongous explosion.' 'There apparently wasn't any kind of explosive detonator cap.' 'The valves on the propane tanks were not open, so the gas was not seeping out of the propane tanks.' Well thank you all very much for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, great news. They made an arrest today in that failed Times Square bombing attempt. ... It turns out the suspect is a foreign-born, naturalized American citizen. You know what that means? He would have been fine in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His name is Faisal Shahzad. ... What, is Snoop Dogg naming terrorists now? ... They're still looking for his brother, Fo Shizzle. They don't know where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the amazing part, they arrested this guy. He was already on the plane. It was taxiing down the runway. They called the plane back. And they're calling it great work by Homeland Security, and I guess it is. I mean, that's one way to look at it. I mean, how about the fact that a Pakistani guy who bought a one-way ticket to the Middle East, reeking of fertilizer, made it through security and got on the plane. How did that happen?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's really happy they took him off the plane? The guy sitting next to him. ... Smelling manure for 14 hours?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, police raided this guy's house. I guess it's in Bridgeport, Connecticut. ... Some of the neighbors say the suspect told them he worked on Wall Street, so they were relieved to find out he was just a terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real hero in this story was the t-shirt vendor...who told the policeman about the smoke coming from the SUV in Times Square. And for some reason, New York Mayor Bloomberg took the policeman to dinner but not the t-shirt vendor. Hey, you see the t-shirt he's selling today?&quot; It says, &quot;'I saw the smoking SUV first, all I got was this lousy t-shirt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, this Faisal guy, not the brightest terrorist. Did you see his bomb? Three bottles of Diet Coke and some Mentos. You know, that's not going to do a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, it turns out this Faisal Shahzad&quot; has &quot;got a Facebook page. We looked it up. ... Let's see who his friends are. Look, bin Laden, Ahmadinejad...and Danny Bonaduce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are his favorite activities? ... What have we got there? We got beach volleyball, rollerblading. Look, blowing up Nissan Pathfinders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on at BP, which stands for, of course, big problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, British Petroleum promised to pay all necessary clean-up costs for this oil spill. ... And they said they will do it, no matter how much they have to raise gas prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of embarrassing. The government has called off the Safety Awards for Excellence ceremony that was supposed to take place this week, in honor of outstanding safety and pollution prevention. And British Petroleum, the one that was responsible for the big oil spill in the Gulf, was one of the three finalists for the award. ... I believe the other two were China and the volcano in Iceland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former aides to John Edwards are now claiming that Rielle Hunter lied to Oprah during her interview last week. Let me tell you something. You can lie in court in this country. You can lie at work. When you lie to Oprah; that is downright un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Dumb Guy Ways To Fix The Oil Spill:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Have you tried club soda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Relax. BP says they got it under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Shhh. 'Dancing with the Stars' is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Swiffer that sumbitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Ask John McCain how they handled the Great Oil Spill of '23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Don't look at me. I voted for Kucinich!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If you got an extension cord, I got a Shop-Vac Wet N' Dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Oil spill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. I thought Iron Man was on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Invade Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bombing plot here in Times Square is upsetting. ... Are we more upset about that than the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? Which do we hate worse? ... I think you've got to go with the oil spill. ... British petroleum, these boobs running this operation, they said, 'Okay, now wait a minute. It's just going to be a PR nightmare. What can we do? We'll give everybody a free tank of gas. ... All you have to do is drive your car right down next to...the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But BP plans to pay for the clean- up. Then they're going to ask for the bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say the oil spill has the potential to kill more wildlife than a Sarah Palin hunting trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it's British Petroleum, or BP. BP, of course, as in broken pipe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, they plucked a guy off a plane. His name is Faisel Shahzad. They say he was a moody loner. Last year, he vacationed in the tribal regions of Pakistan. Well, no red flags there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg held a press conference. He described the bomb because everybody thought, wow, this is frightening. This is crazy. But the Mayor said, no, the bomb was crude and amateurish. ... That's what a lot of people are saying about last night's show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't you feel secure, ladies and gentlemen, knowing that the only thing standing between you and terrorism is a t-shirt vendor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say the FBI is saying potentially this thing could have been the biggest bomb on Broadway since Peter Pan, starring Kirstie Alley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was in town yesterday? Iranian dictator Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was here, and his Members Only jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was speaking at the UN. Now, seriously, New York City is not this guy's kind of town. Everybody here is either gay or Jewish. He had to get out. He said, 'No thank you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Arizona? Yeah, you know, they have this immigration law in Arizona. I guess it's because they share a border with Mexico. In essence, the new law in Arizona is if you don't look like you belong there, get out. ... And if you're in this country illegally, I think I speak for most Americans when I say, '?Qu??'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're in Arizona and you don't look like you belong there, they'll give you a simple test. You have to be able to identify four of Larry King's ex-wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's rumored that six pages from the script of the 'Lost' series finale have leaked online. BP executives were like, 'Oh my God! That's definitely the worst leak of all time, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, scientists are predicting that the oil from the BP spill will eventually reach the shores of Florida. So if you hated visiting your grandparents before, wait until you're hosing down their oily bodies after a long day at the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we caught a suspect in the failed Times Square attack. ... The suspect...says he acted alone. Yeah, really alone. Even his bomb wasn't in on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of terrorism, two new videos from the Pakistani Taliban seem to show that their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is alive, even though the US thought he was killed. So, either our intelligence is wrong or they're just shooting the new movie, 'Weekend at Hakimullah's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He could have been back home in Pakistan by now. Which is worse, by the way? Prison or Pakistan? Maybe the joke's on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, oil is still leaking off the coast of Louisiana. Lots of oil. BP, the company responsible for it, has a very good plan. BP is hoping to create a giant vinegar spill to turn the Gulf of Mexico into a delicious salad dressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, what they're doing is...spraying chemicals on the oil to try to disperse it. And some environmentalists say the chemicals pose their own dangers. But the company that makes them points out the active ingredient is the same thing they put in ice cream. BP is trying to get the spill reclassified from disaster to dessert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Police make an arrest in that failed bombing on Times Square, taking a Pakistani-born US citizen into custody.' ... The suspect is...Faisal Shahzad, which freaked me out because my doctor had just put me on Faisal, for my eczema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they got the guy, and this was no ordinary arrest. 'Last night, last-second arrest of Faisal Shahzad, about to take off for Dubai.' ... 'A hair-raising thriller here to tell you about that began with a makeshift bomb and ended with a thwarted getaway.' Yeah! It's just like an action movie! It even has a black president!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you know about this? Tonight, to protest Arizona's new immigration law, the Phoenix Suns are all wearing jerseys that read 'Los Suns.' Thankfully, they can get the jerseys made quickly using an illegal sweatshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the Phoenix Suns are wearing jerseys written in Spanish, made in China, modeled after their best player, Canadian Steve Nash. There you go. That is America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, we're starting to learn more and more about that man arrested in the New York SUV car bombing case. His name is...Faisal Shahzad. He's from Pakistan. What tipped off the authorities he might be the bomber? His name is Faisal Shahzad. He's from Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, looks like this guy was having financial problems as well. Turns out his house was in foreclosure. See, apparently the Taliban does not pay very well. ... And not to mention, no benefits. Who would take a job as a car bomber where they tell you, you have to use your own car? That's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If any job should give you a company car, it's the car bomb business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the bomb turned out to be a dud, thankfully. ... But had it exploded, it would have been the biggest bomb to hit New York since the Knicks, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about this. Here's what I came up with. Now, in Arizona, you know about the new immigration law, where if you don't look like you belong there, they can run you out of the state. And they've got...patrol cars driving around, pulling up to people, saying, 'You don't look like you belong here. Get out!' So the deal is, in Arizona, they don't like immigrants. And I was thinking, well, that's odd, because right across the river there in California, they elected one governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday...was Cinco de Mayo. Today, of course, was 'Sinko the Dow Jones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market took a dive today. ... It was so bad, Goldman Sachs had to lay off three congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece has...a national debt that is so large, they can never pay it back. Well, thank God that can never happen here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum says they're going to try and stop that huge oil leak in the 'Gulf of Texaco', as I call it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to put a big box over the leak. I mean, who came up with this, Wile E. Coyote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to protest Arizona's tough new immigration law, a lot of people now boycotting products made in that state. ... This could cripple the bolo tie industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that a good idea? Boycotting products made in Arizona? ... I can't find any products made in America. Forget Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is the Border Patrol has finally come up with a way to stop the illegal immigration. They're going to hire security guards from the Phillies game to just taser people as they come through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as a result of the Times Square bomber, there is a new policy regarding the no-fly list. They're actually going to start reading them now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this Faisal Shahzad...managed to get on the plane because the airline workers used an out of date do not fly list. ... But the good news? There is no way Lee Harvey Oswald was getting on that plane, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Times Square bomber? ... Now, I'm no genius, but this guy left his house keys in the bomb car. ... It was the one flaw in an otherwise perfect crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is some good news for Faisal Shahzad. Today he was told that he made the Taliban blooper real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard this about the Times Square bomber. ... The suspect...says he left a...getaway car near Times Square but was unable to use it on Saturday because he left the keys in the Pathfinder. That had to be a weird call to OnStar, right? 'Hello, OnStar. What is your emergency?' 'Oh, man, you are not going to believe this. So, I'm trying to blow up Times Square, right? I am in such a hurry to escape...I totally locked the keys in my car. It's just one of those days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news out of New York. The new Broadway play about Enron didn't get any major Tony nominations and will lose $4 million when it closes on Sunday. In other words, it was a major success compared to the real Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it turns out the prime suspect in the failed attempt to bomb Times Square is not the brightest. ... They figured out the events leading up to Saturday. First,&quot; Faisal Shahzad &quot;buys an SUV off Craigslist, using a traceable email, and fills it with, basically, wedding sparklers. Then he drives two different cars into New York -- the one with the bomb in it and a getaway car. He plants the bomb but leaves the keys to the getaway car in the car with the bomb in it. So he has to take the subway home. And then, once he gets home, he realizes he also left the key to his apartment in the SUV with the bomb in it, and has to get his landlord to let him in. ... If this isn't the work of a stoner, I don't know what is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should probably let him out and go join the Taliban. He could destroy them from within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faisal Shahzad, aka, 'The Wannabomber,'&quot; is &quot;not just a terrorist. He's a moron. 'He drove another car to Times Square last Friday, the day before the attempted bombing, apparently to be his getaway car. But they say he left the getaway keys hanging in the rear hatch door of the bomb-carrying SUV.' 'He also left behind the keys to his home.' ... What are we going to do in this country when we get attacked by someone who is not one of the 'Home Alone' burglars?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece's financial crisis threatens to take down all of Western civilization, a civilization they themselves founded.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a report circulating that this terrorist, this Faisal Shahzad guy that was caught at the airport, because the Army used sophisticated intelligence aircraft to hone in on his cell phone signal. They said a fighter plane scrambled found his signal and located him at the airport and tracked him down. ... I guess that's much easier than just looking for his name on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police searched the apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where this Shahzad guy was living. And they said he had no furniture, he slept on an air mattress, drank instant coffee and had a couple of free weights lying around. Terrorist? That's every divorced guy I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it seems like nothing has really been accomplished in the Gulf, and the situation gets worse every day, the government claims they've been involved since day one. Yeah. And they cite as proof of their involvement, nothing has really been accomplished and the situation has been getting worse every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crews attempted to lower a 100-ton concrete box, a huge box, four-story building a mile under the Gulf to stop the leak, putting concrete over the leak to stop it. This is not the first time dropping concrete in water to stop leaks has been used. I think the mob has been doing this for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the stock market fell again today after a huge drop yesterday. ... It's falling like Kate Gosselin after a tango lesson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stock prices are so low, Wall Street is starting to look like Wal-Mart street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so bad. Today, the head of Goldman Sachs made his assistant jump out the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, this crisis in Greece. This is unbelievable, this whole Greece is the word we're talking about. ... Well, it's being blamed on overspending, but government spending is needed to stimulate the economy, according to Greek president, Barack Obamopolous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top investment analyst says that China's economy will slow down and crash within a year, which is pretty scary. I mean, where are we going to get all of our defective drywall and toys with lead in them for our children?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big lettuce recall in 25 states because of possible E. coli. They believe the problem might be traced to lettuce from Arizona. See? This is what happens when you let US citizens pick their own lettuce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about the new immigration laws in Arizona? What it is, if they don't like your looks, they can have you deported. I don't like how you look. You're out of here. But you new law is essentially buy a pinata, go to jail. That's exactly what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Arizona government is very defensive about this because people are saying that. They're saying you're just looking for the Mexicans who are over the border illegally. And the Arizona governor said, 'No, no, no. Earlier today we were rounding up Germans.' Which, by the way, is never a bad idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems like every week there's something new to be sick about, and this week, of course, it's the big British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Have you folks been looking at this thing? This is crazy. The thing collapses, and the safety valve, when it collapses, the safety valve is snapped off so the pipe coming out of the ocean floor-- I'm sorry, the Gulf floor-- is now pumping. It's leaking a little bit of oil-- 200,000 gallons a day. 200,000 gallons a day pumping right up into the Gulf of Mexico. It's affecting everything. I was at lunch on Sunday, and I ordered the sea bass. My hand to God it's a true story. The waiter said to me, 'Do you want regular or unleaded?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum the people that caused the big oil leak, they're saying they have the problem under control. What's that British Petroleum is saying, it's leaking -- I'm sorry, gushing -- I'm sorry, spewing -- 200,000 gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico of every day. British Petroleum says, 'You know what? We're taking care of this.' Well, that's good enough for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's speculation that yesterday's 1,000-point drop in the Dow may have been sparked by a typo. When someone entered billion instead of million on a trading order. Yeah. Economists are saying a single letter hasn't caused this many problems since the letter 'w.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a crazy week here in New York with the whole Times Square bombing. Federal authorities are now conducting an internal review to see if the suspect, Faisal Shahzad, was overlooked as potential terrorist threat. I'll save them some work. Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Faisal Shahzad, there are reports that he's been bragging about his connections to global terrorists. And the only thing more annoying than a terrorist is a name-dropper, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some good news. The price of oil has dropped by $12 a barrel. I mean, why buy it when you can just scoop it out of the water, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that. If anybody needs a 100-ton concrete containment dome, there's one on eBay for 75 bucks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, that stupid idea about using a giant concrete dome and putting it over the leak, well, that didn't work. In fact, experts are calling this the worst use of a concrete dome since they built that stadium for the Detroit Lions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they're talking about trying to clog the leak up with garbage, like tires and golf balls. You know, where are the OxiClean people? Why don't we bring them down? Why not use the miracle cleaning power of oranges? Where are those people? Let's get the experts in here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress told BP they can't label this catastrophic failure as an unpredictable and unforeseeable occurrence. See, Congress used that excuse for not catching the financial meltdown, so now they have to come up with their own excuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece has a huge economic crisis. ... Tourism's down there. Government spending is up. And...Greece hasn't done anything in 2,000 years, really. I mean, other than that little to-go coffee cup in New York, there's not a lot they've made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece is a relatively small country. It would be like a state over here. But it overspends, it over borrows, it promises expensive pension plans, it over-taxes, it over-regulates business. So, the state it would be here would be California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not looking good around the world, folks. ... A top investment analyst says China's economy will slow down and crash within the year. You know, they already have signs of trouble over there, too. Do you know the unemployment rate is a staggering 12% among 3-year-olds in China?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in announcing this Elena Kagan as his nominee for the Supreme Court, President Barack Obama characterized Kagan as a 'trailblazing leader.' The other Democrats said she was a wise choice because she had no paper trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Colorado one of the gubernatorial...candidates has taken out a Craigslist ad to find a running mate. ... Is that a good idea? Hey, it didn't work when John McCain tried it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our transportation secretary, a man named Ray LaHood, announced that we are going to reopen the US border to Mexican trucks. ... Apparently they couldn't squeeze enough people into vans anymore, so they're going to trucks now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the British Petroleum oil executives -- the guys responsible for the big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- they testified before Congress. This was great. They were criticized by the same guys who approved drilling in the Gulf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these British Petroleum executives&quot; are &quot;trying to spin this a little bit. I heard one guy say today that it's a good thing actually because now when you open a clam, the hinge doesn't squeak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend, President Obama...gave an impassioned speech against technology. And then he had to stop when the teleprompter broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; has &quot;officially named Solicitor General Elena Kagan&quot; as &quot;his nominee to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest plan was to cover the leak with another concrete dome, a smaller one called a 'top hat.' ... Who came up with this idea, Mr. Moneybags, from the Monopoly game? What's next, the giant thimble?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Senate today voted to toughen standards for home loans. Under these new standards, lenders would have to verify the borrowers can repay the loan. ... Let's just hope China doesn't adopt this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that oil spill in the Gulf? ... They were going to put down what they called a 'containment platform'...and they were going to lower it into the Gulf. ... But that didn't work. So now, British Petroleum wants to try something else. It's a smaller containment device called the 'top hat.' ... They get the 'top hat' on the well, and then they're going to get John Wilkes Booth to shoot at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news from the world of publishing. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, has a new book coming out this fall. The warning came from an alert t-shirt vendor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Cairo have detained an American man who arrived on a flight from JFK with two handguns, 250 bullets, swords, daggers, and knives in his luggage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prison inmates in Louisiana are now pitching in to clean up the Gulf Coast oil spill. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General Eric Holder has said he may sue Arizona for their new anti-immigration law. Holder admitted he has not yet read the law. ... Hey, that didn't stop Congress from passing the healthcare reform bill. Nobody read that either.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks it's happened again. My favorite kind of story. Indiana Republican congressman named Mark Souder -- a married man and father of three, big-time -- one of these family advocates guys, has resigned after admitting to having an affair with a female staffer. ... In his resignation statement, he mentions God five times and his wife once. He knows there's a slight chance that God might forgive him. God might let it slide. Not the wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The chief US oversight official for offshore drilling has now resigned. Ironically -- you know how the news got out? It leaked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's now concern that the oil in the Gulf could go to the Florida Keys and up the East Coast, which could be really dangerous. Scientists say the cast of 'The Jersey Shore' can only absorb so much oil. They can't get any slimier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government now wants to train parking lot attendants to watch for terrorists.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this guy, Richard Blumenthal? He's a Democratic candidate for Senate in Connecticut. It turns out he actually lied about serving in Vietnam.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blumenthal lied about serving in Vietnam in several speeches, which I guess explains why his descriptions of the war sounded like Wikipedia entries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big story in Connecticut. Their attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who was considered a shoo-in for his race for the US Senate, is now under fire for claiming that he served in Vietnam when he really didn't. ... Turns out he has no war record at all. In fact, only combat experience? Shooting himself in the foot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the truth is he got five deferments, like Dick Cheney. Then he used connections to get into a special reserve unit, like George Bush. And he would have been fine, if he hadn't lied like John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news today for Blumenthal. Because of all the trouble he's in for lying, he was offered a job as spokesman for British Petroleum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. On the news today, the CEO of British Petroleum says he believes the overall environmental impact of this oil spill will be very, very modest. Yeah. If you live in England!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP has inserted a siphon tube into the well to suck up all the oil from the spill. And they've had a lot of experience in this area, by the way. This is the same tube they've been using to suck the money out of our wallets for the past 50 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of bees swarmed the White House Sunday morning. ... And President Obama...doesn't miss a trick. He is smart. Because all these bees were worker bees, he's now counted them as 10,000 new jobs he's created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in welcoming Mexico's President Felipe Calderon to the White House today, President Obama told him, 'We are not defined by our borders.' The president of Mexico said, 'What borders?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one embarrassing moment...with the Mexican president&quot; happened when &quot;Obama said, 'Let us all stand together,'&quot; and &quot;the governor of Arizona said, 'There he is. Grab him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain of Arizona&quot; is &quot;facing a tough reelection campaign. ... The key issue is illegal immigration. I don't want to say McCain is old, but in his first election, the illegal immigrants were white people, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another show canceled right here at CBS, 'The Ghost Whisperer.' ... Every week, the ghost whisperer would run errands for dead people. This week, you tune in, she's trying to find a job for Arlen Specter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blumenthal said he is not apologizing for misleading people about his war record. He said all he did was use the word 'in' instead of the word 'during.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Federal agency that regulates offshore oil drilling refused to send a witness to the Senate committee hearing this week. And, of course, people are stunned. 'What? There's actually an agency that regulates oil drilling? Where the hell have they been? Who are these people?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now British Petroleum said it is...a far bigger oil leak than they estimated. And our latest story -- the executives of British Petroleum are far bigger idiots than we estimated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, everywhere you go today, people are talking about 'Lost.' But enough about the stock market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a very embarrassing moment&quot; for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, &quot;who was running for the Senate. You know, he's the guy...that lied about his war record. I guess that he was overheard telling his wife after the campaign, 'Let's take a vacation and go somewhere I've never been.' And she said, 'Hey, how about Vietnam?' Awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of Greece's impending bankruptcy, many countries in Europe are demanding that Greece change their laws that allow workers to retire as early as age 50. ... Actually, in our country, there's a place that forces women to retire when they hit 40. It's called Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shell Oil...announced that they plan this summer to start drilling in the Arctic this summer. ... What could possibly go wrong? I mean, honestly. Go ahead, go nuts. Just drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview on ABC's 'Nightline,' Jesse James says he's probably the most hated man in the world. ... And the CEO of BP was like, 'Dude, don't flatter yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, BP executive Doug Suttles predicted that his company will survive the Gulf Coast oil spill. Seriously? That's like running over someone's dog and going, 'Don't worry, my car is fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP said today that in a worst case scenario, it would take until August to clean up the Gulf Coast. That's not so bad. I mean, who goes in the ocean during the summer anyway, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it seems that oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, much worse than British Petroleum first reported. You know how bad it is? Yesterday, I checked the oil in my car, had seawater on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the ocean currents, experts say oil from the Gulf could easily spread up the East Coast all the way to the Carolinas. In fact, today, people in North Carolina said they hadn't seen anything this slick and slimy since the John Edwards campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, Mexican President Felipe Calderone spoke at the White House. He called for a ban on assault weapons, and he also wanted to know why do we keep calling Taco Bell Mexican food?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Calderone also lashed out against Arizona's new immigration law. To give you an idea of how serious he is, he is calling for Mexicans to boycott sneaking into this country until that law is repealed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House, speaking last week, a rodent ran in front&quot; of President Obama &quot;as he stood at the podium. ... In fact, the rat was picked up on the microphone going, 'How do I get off this sinking ship?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another bad day for the stock market. The stock market is bad. ... It's so bad,&quot; for a &quot;lot of brokers now, there's a half hour waiting line to get on the ledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and scientists in Maryland say they have created the first-ever synthetic cell. ... They say their goal is to create a life form that can withstand lead products from China, volcanic ash from Iceland, and contaminated water from the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Montana man&quot; has admitted that he killed a &quot;bald eagle, but his alibi is he thought it was a porcupine. How blind do you have to be to mistake a bald eagle for a porcupine? Anyway, the guy pled guilty so he could get back to his regular job...inspecting oil rigs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You starting to get sick about the economy again? ... I was talking to my broker today. ... And he said, 'Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine.' Then the prison guards took him away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the end of the big TV viewing season. ... For example, 'Lost', that's gone. ... 'Law &amp; Order', wrapping it up. Also say good-bye to the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum is now saying the oil spill was caused by a bad underwater cement job. ... You don't have that problem with the mob.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain... is angry with British Petroleum. But in all fairness, he's had a grudge against the British since the Revolutionary War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty hard for...fans of 'Lost' now that it's finally over. If people want to get their fix, they'll have to follow that other group that's lost and confused in the middle of the ocean. You know, BP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News is launching a website this fall aimed at the Latino population. ... Latinos were like, 'Wait, what is Fox News aiming at?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is backing a new plan to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' ... They want to relax the harsh standard and implement their new policy, 'Just Try To Not Make It Super Obvious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how bad it's getting. Experts predict by next fall sea water will be $4 a gallon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is hope. Earlier today, British Petroleum began this operation known as 'top kill,'&quot; which &quot;comes on the heels of their previous operations, 'fish kill' and 'bird kill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, here's something that's going to get a lot of people upset.

And you know who arranged the payoffs? Fergie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a White House report, President Obama becoming more and more frustrated by this whole oil leak thing. He lost his temper today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced yesterday he plans to send 1,200 troops to the US/Mexican border. You know who we should hire to protect our border? It's so simple. Mexicans. They want jobs, they're there already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that 43% of Americans think President Obama is doing a good job at handling the BP oil spill. Of course, the same poll found that 43% of Americans hate pelicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today at a press conference, Obama said that the government does not have better technology than BP.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Obama fired the head of the Mineral Management Services, because of lack of oversight of offshore oil rigs. It's got to be tough finding another job after that. It's like, 'I see you were head of the department in charge of preventing oil spills? .... And this was during the huge oil spill?' &quot;Yeah, that's right.' 'You may not be Wendy's material.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Gulf oil spill now officially the worst in the US history. In fact, they're calling this the biggest environmental disaster since the state of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we're right in the middle of a process called 'top kill.' Doesn't it sound like some bad Steven Seagal movie from the '80s?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP says if 'top kill' fails, they'll try something called the 'junk shot.' Hey, worked last night for the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a big new scandal going on. Have you heard about this? Republicans are now saying that President Obama had Bill Clinton offer a job to Pennsylvania's Joe Sestak in exchange for dropping out of the Pennsylvania Senate race against Arlen Specter. It's kind of complicated. But if it's true, it's an impeachable offense. That's what they're saying. They're comparing it to the Clinton impeachment. Close, but no cigar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a rough day in the stock market. ... It's so bad, today, President Obama had to lay off two teleprompters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is...now clear that BP's latest idea to solve the oil leak by waiting for Aquaman to talk dolphins into stuffing themselves into it may not work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they've tried a couple different ways to fix this damn thing. There was the 'top hat' idea, where they were going to put a dome over the whole thing. That didn't work. Then there was the 'junk shot', where they tried to fill the pipe with mud and golf balls and trash. And that didn't work, although on the plus side, we did fill the Gulf of Mexico with mud, golf balls and trash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But fear not, America, the President of the United States of America is on the case! 'I'm not going to rest or be satisfied until the leak is stopped.' ... He will be on this thing 24 hours a day, right after celebrating the great Connecticut Huskies women's basketball national championship. ... 'Anybody here majored in oil leaks? Anybody? Anybody?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, the President has said that his top priority is the oil spill. He said that in May 2010. You know, he made a very similar pronouncement in May 2009 for another pressing issue. 'Healthcare reform is a key priority to this Presidency. That's why I will not rest until the dream of healthcare reform is finally achieved in the United States of America.' And, ten months later, we had it. So the oil should stop flowing, in March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or, to put that in terms the President understands, NCAA basketball tournament time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Occupational Safety and Health Administration records showed that in the last three years, BP ran up 760 egregious, willful safety violations at their US refineries.' Impressive, but amazing? Well, we really won't know until we compare it to something. 'This dwarfed violations from other oil companies. ... Exxon had one.' One! Exxon had one! The people who think nothing of putting tigers into people's tanks. They had one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does BP explain such a horrendous safety record? 'Much of that record relates to a prior period, and our absolute focus the last three or four years has been on safe and reliable operations.' No, no, no! The record did not relate to a prior period. It related to the three or four years that you just said it was your priority. ... Well, I guess that explains BP's old slogan: 'Raping The Earth &amp; Fomenting Civil Unrest In The Middle East Since 1909.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, like millions of Americans, for the last two weeks, I've had my...eyeballs glued to an exciting new television drama. It's the hit summer series, 'Grainy Footage of Leaking Underwater Oil Pipe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the twists and turns have been non-stop. First, BP tried the 'top hat.' Then they tried 'top kill.' Next, they're going to try 'top chef,' where they plug the hole with Tom Colicchio's giant, bald head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm a serious pipe head, but there is one thing I haven't figured out about this series ? who's the villain? I mean, it can't be BP. ... 'We're taking full responsibility for it. We're not blaming anyone yet.' They're not blaming anyone yet. They won't jump to conclusions before all the facts, data, and one-way tickets to Paraguay come in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, all the fan sites have their own ideas about who the villain is. I like this theory. 'The President and his people are in charge of this under the Oil Spill Liability Act, and they don't have a plan.' 'For more than a week, the White House appeared to pay little attention to this event.' 'And we don't have one ounce of action from the President.' Yes! Obama. He wanted it to leak, because that would prove what he said in March when he allowed off-shore drilling. 'It turns out, by the way, that oil rigs today generally don't cause spills.' Clearly, they don't cause spills. They cause unstoppable gushers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'm sure we've got plenty of time to figure...out&quot; who the villain is &quot;because it looks like 'Grainy Footage of Leaking Underwater Oil Pipe' has been renewed indefinitely. I just hope they don't jump the shark. Are there any sharks left? No. Oh, good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For months now, I've been warning you that President Obama is ending America's manned space program. Soon, the only way for Americans to launch themselves into space will be to row out into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and toss a lit match overboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now...we really, really need to save the program because my lifelong dream was to be an astronaut, and soon, I will fly to Houston for space training. I've already started it at home. To get used to weightlessness, I have let my muscles atrophy for 46 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, all of that hard training may go to waste, because there are only two space shuttle missions left. Just last week, Atlantis returned from its final planned mission, where astronaut Steven Bowen, during a seven-hour space walk, bravely untangled a space shuttle cable. Because otherwise, they would have had to wait for the Comcast guy between the hours of noon and 2050.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, don't get me wrong. ... I understand why they needed to retire Atlantis. That thing was built back in 1985. It's got 120 million miles on it, and the wiper blades are shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Middle East and the Korean Peninsula -- two great tastes that threaten to annihilate us altogether. 'Hey! You got religious strife in my ethnic tension!' 'You got ethnic tension in my religious strife!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, Israeli commandoes raided a flotilla of ships in international waters that were attempting to carry 10,000 tons of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in violation of an Israeli blockade.&quot; This led to an &quot;Israeli assault&quot; that killed &quot;at least nine activists. ... Israelis said the activists attacked them first with clubs. The activists said they never attacked the soldiers, they thought Israel was welcoming them with commando shaped pi?atas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As to why Israel had elite Navy SEALs repelling on to the deck of what looks like P. Diddy's St. Bart's vacation yacht, Israel says they had to search the boats to see if there were any materials that could be used to build explosives and supply tunnels. So what nefarious accoutrement of terror did they find? ... 'Here are some hospital beds and here are some wheelchairs.' I knew it. Hamas has been working on a crutch-a-pult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, the crutch-a-pult, perhaps the most humane weapon to be hit with. It fires crutches, so even if it hurts you, you have...something to help you get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So this story is apparently...very complex. ... I wonder how the world will react to the incident. ... Flag burnings, violent protests. Or, as it's known in that part of the world: Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sir Paul McCartney played at the White House last night. He dedicated the Beatles song 'Michelle' to the First Lady. Isn't that lovely? And then for Joe Biden, he played 'Fool on the Hill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Underwater robots have successfully cut through the pipe on top of the blown out BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico.' ... The next step...is to lower a dome -- well, another dome -- over the pipe. Although, unlike the first two failed domes, this dome is heated, to either prevent ice crystal buildup or to appease the leak by building it nicer and nicer places to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, if the heated dome doesn't work, maybe we're just going to give it a three bedroom house, wood floors, granite kitchen ? the works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, a simple plan for fixing the problem in the Gulf of Mexico. Just rename it the Black Sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we have all been horrified by this oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but I am happy today to report there was finally some good news from BP. ... 'A more risky attempt to plug that gushing well in the Gulf of Mexico recovers from a major snag. Workers free a saw that got stuck while cutting the damaged pipe.' They got their saw back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I was worried, because it was a really nice saw. It had diamonds on it. They chose it for the occasion because, like a diamond, this oil spill is forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And getting that saw blade free allowed BP to cut through the undersea pipe, which means more good news. 'Twenty percent more likely oil is spewing than was before because they've opened up the hole bigger.' It's all part of BP's new strategy ? draining the Earth as fast as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts are estimating that the oil could continue leaking through Christmas, which means there's a good chance the hot holiday toy this year is going to be the Clean-It-Yourself Egret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to tell you, in the face of this tragedy, I'm beginning to wonder just how committed the Obama Administration really is to fixing this mess because they are dismissing the one bold solution that we know would work. 'As for the so-called 'nuclear option,' literally, that's making the rounds on the Web, detonating some sort of nuclear device near the oil well shaft, the Pentagon tells us no consideration, serious, that is, being given to that idea at all.' 'They say the nuclear option has never been on the table.' Never on the table? The nuclear option is always on the table. Of course, we'll never use it, but it acts as a deterrent against that oil spill. And we already know it has chemical and biological weapons, because it is them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, nuking oil wells is proven technology. The Russians have used nukes to stop leaks like this five times already. Though to be fair, they also use nukes when they get locked out of their house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you...can believe it, folks, an Administration official actually said the nuke plan, quote, 'It's crazy.' Yeah. Crazy awesome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, it's not guaranteed to work, and sure, no one knows how the radiation would spread or affect wildlife, and sure, it would violate international treaties, but come on. It would turn the bottom of the ocean to glass. How cool is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if we nuked the seafloor and turned it to glass, we wouldn't have to do any more exploratory drilling. We could just see where the oil is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Push the button, President Obama. This is no time to wave the white flag. For one thing, with all that oil, it's not going to stay white for very long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, consumer confidence is way down, but I have a solution -- poor-quality merchandise. Think of the boost to the economy if instead of buying one good coffee maker every five years, you're buying five crappy coffee makers every one year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, of course, there are unpatriotic souls who value quality over quantity, people who reject the cries of, 'Buy American!', and instead cry, 'Don't buy that! It will set fire to your drapes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like the nervous Nellies over at 'Consumer Reports' magazine. I ask you, if they know so much about what consumers want, why are they still a magazine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying now that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could go until August. Six months leaking oil. Just like your old Chevy Nova in the driveway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to get the oil spill fixed and we need to put a cap on it, but BP is not making it easy.&quot; The CEO of &quot;British Petroleum...said, 'There's no one that wants this thing over more than I do. I'd like my life back.' You know what? We ought to put a cap on that fool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to BP, this containment cap is now capturing, they're capturing 10,000 barrels of oil a day. Which is amazing, considering they said it was only leaking 1,000 barrels a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP officials are now saying the campaign to clean it up could last until fall. That's why they call it a campaign. You know why it's called a campaign? Because it's like an election. It's dirty, it's slimy, it never seems to end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP -- they are spending $50 million on an advertisement budget to try and put a pr spin on this whole thing. Like, you hear what they said today? This is unbelievable. They said fishermen down there are catching tuna that are getting 35 miles per gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC just announced who's going to be the next contestant on 'The Bachelor.' Surprisingly, Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were you sad to learn that Al Gore and his wife, Tipper -- I was. I was a little sad about that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh got married for the fourth time on Saturday. He's 59, she's 33. So, I'm doing the math. That means when she's 40, he'll be on wife number seven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House reporter Helen Thomas &quot;is retiring after making some quite controversial comments about Israel. She said Jews should leave the Middle East and go back to where they came from. The problem is that's where they came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea now the level, the quality of training that the terrorists are getting: These two guys trained every weekend to become terrorists by playing paint ball. If they got really good at paint ball, Al Qaeda would let them plant a bomb in a go-cart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore and his wife, long time married couple, are separating. Tipper Gore. And they may get a divorce. Apparently what happened, they experienced global cooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now the official Rush Limbaugh wedding announcement. ... Rush Limbaugh wed Catherine Rogers in a quiet Florida ceremony on Saturday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama spoke at Kalamazoo's central high school graduation ceremony in Michigan. He told the students they could be anything they want to be, but if they could be oil leak experts, that could be great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP's CEO Tony Hayward said yesterday that he will not step down over the gulf oil coast spill. Yeah, he said, 'I mean, it's not like I let one of the biggest ecological disasters in history happen. Oh, I did? ... Well, at least my first attempt at cleaning it up worked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he's not stepping down, Tony Hayward is handing over responsibility to the cleanup to an American named Bob Dudley. There's a name that gives me confidence. ... It sounds like a sitcom character who's always messing everything up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Tony Haywire guy, whatever his name is, he told the BBC on Sunday that he believes the new oil cap that they've installed will eventually capture the vast majority of oil spewing from the well.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BP CE Tony Hayward &quot;said he would just like to get his life back. He wants to get his life back. You know, I say give him life plus 20.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2005 Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010 the Gulf was devastated by the largest off- shore oil spill in US history but the fun is just beginning. The governors of the Gulf coast states are pleased to announce they are now accepting bids for the next disaster to hit the region in 2015.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A great day for President Obama. He addressed a group of senior citizens in Maryland today. He's pitching his healthcare bill.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, the Obama's invited members of congress to a picnic at the White House. Yeah. They played all the classic picnic games -- Wiffle ball, capture the flag and their favorite game, ignore the oil spill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama's picnic featured foods from all over the four corners of the US, the Pacific Northwest provided the wild salmon and strawberries and the Southern Gulf Coast provided 400 million gallons of salad dressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today marked the 50th day of the BP oil spill. Yeah, the oil spill is getting so old, its tar balls are starting to sag.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1934 the first Donald Duck cartoon premiered. ... He's 76 years old. ... You'd think if America loved a 76-year-old...guy with a hot temper so much, we would've elected John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few days ago, Vice President Biden and Rahm Emanuel had a water gun fight during a party at Biden's house. ... Meanwhile, Sasha and Malia spent the last few days trying to solve the BP oil crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little bit of good news. The Coast Guard says that Bp is now catching up to 630,000 gallons of oil a day. The bad news is that they're capturing it with ducks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of the biggest races were in California, where both the Senate and the governor's mansion are up for grabs. There, former Hewlett-Packard CEO... Carly Fiorina will get the chance to square off against Barbara Boxer. And also, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman won the chance to face former California Governor Jerry Brown, answering the question: Is former Governor Jerry Brown still alive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'You know, career politicians in Sacramento and Washington, DC, be warned, because you now face your worst nightmare. ... Two business women from the real world...who know how to create jobs, balance budgets and get things done.' Yes! Of course, she's referring to the business savvy of Carly Fiorina, named as one of Portfolio magazine's 20 worst CEOs of all time, and who, in only six years, was able to reduce Hewlett-Packard stock value by, oh, I don't know, a third.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or perhaps she was tooting her own fiscal bona fides. 'Meg Whitman has contributed $71 million from her own fortune.' Ah, she spent $71 million of her own money on the race, against state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner,&quot; a &quot;bespeckled insurance agent whose last name sounds like poison her. California is back, people!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never been a fan of journalists. ... But earlier this week, the world of journalism lost a legend when Helen Thomas was forced into retirement at the tender age of 89. She had so many productive hours ahead of her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP, which of course stands for 'Born Polluted,'&quot; is &quot;spending $50 million on a PR campaign to make themselves look good. ... In fact, they said they would burn the midnight oil if they hadn't spilled it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, BP has the worst safety record of all the oil companies. They've paid over $372 million in fines. Oh, they don't call them fines. They call them 'campaign contributions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voter turnout here in California, all-time historic low. In fact, the polling places near my house had so few people they actually turned it into a Blockbuster video store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House announced they have come up with a cheap, effective solution for illegal immigration. They're going to have Helen Thomas on the border, yelling, 'Go back to Mexico! Go back to where you came from! ... Get out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems Hall and Oates have cancelled an upcoming concert in Arizona to protest the state's new immigration law. Well, that will teach Arizona a lesson, huh? Let's see how long they can go without Hall and Oates!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, apparently, Hall and Oates were worried Arizona authorities would make them go back to where they came from -- the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, British Petroleum stock...dropped $17 billion in value. ... And the executives at British Petroleum say they have no idea what happened. I kind of have an idea. I kind of think maybe I got a hunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the good news. Actor Kevin Costner was testifying before Congress earlier today. And he has come up with a way to separate oil from seawater. And so he was telling the congressmen all about it. And previously, Kevin Costner developed a process to separate moviegoers from their money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But British Petroleum, they're getting desperate, so here is what they are going to do to improve their public image. With every 100,000 gallons of oil that leaks, you get a free NFL team glass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys heard about Al Gore and Tipper splitting up? Everybody is talking about it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the economy appears to be on track to continue to expand through this year and next. And then he said, 'And you can take that to one of the remaining banks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Obama met with Bill Gates at the White House to discuss energy reform. It was very cool. Bill Gates offered to plug the Gulf Coast oil leak with 5 billion unsold Zunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain actually tweeted to Snooki&quot; from &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, an MTV program, &quot;after she complained about the tanning bed tax in the new healthcare law.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum's stock has dropped 51% since the oil spill. Good! Now they're leaking money the way they're leaking oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A review of British Petroleum's 582-page plan...to deal with a catastrophic oil spill&quot; was &quot;found to be full of errors and severely flawed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are upset and wondering why President Obama is willing to sit down and talk to the Iranian President Ahmadinejad and not to BP chief Tony Hayward. I guess Obama is meeting with Tony Hayward next week. I think President Obama was a little afraid of Hayward. Think about it. Ahmadinejad only threatened to destroy the world. Hayward is actually doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the only commercial airline in Iraq...went out of business this week. Well, it's not surprising. Iraqi planes are divided in three sections -- first class, coach, and martyr.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're talking about this...bomber. ... And it turns out now that the reason he was so inept is because he failed to complete the al Qaeda training school.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the al Qaeda training school. That was&quot; the bomber's &quot;fallback school when he didn't get into Ball State.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is cool. Vice President Joe Biden is actually in South Africa for the World Cup. Biden is looking forward to all the matches, or as he calls them, 'foosball re-enactments.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US will face England on Saturday, and the US ambassador and the UK ambassador have made a friendly wager on the game. ... If England wins, we have to buy their ambassador tea and crumpets, and if we win, they have to buy us a new ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the whole mess, President Obama may finally meet with BP's CEO Tony Hayward next week. Obama plans to ask Hayward for an update on the spill while Hayward plans to ask Obama for an update on the spill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you been following what's been going on in the South Carolina Democratic primary for the Senate? This is very bizarre.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama said today he's going to use the Gulf disaster to immediately push a new energy bill through Congress. I got an idea. How about first using the Gulf disaster to fix the Gulf disaster?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the heads of the five families -- we call them 'oil companies' -- testified before Congress today. It was billed as 'the tarballs versus the slimeballs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, during the testimony, the President of BP said the underwater cleanup is pretty effective. And when he was done, Congress gave him a standing ovation. Well, sure, they've never seen anybody who could lie better than they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know something, if the oil industry could suck up oil the way they suck up to Congress, the Gulf would have been cleaned up a month ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's an amazing story. A 52-year-old construction worker -- a guy from right here in California -- was arrested in Pakistan today, armed with a pistol and a 40-inch sword. He said he was on a mission to capture Osama bin Laden. Hey, at least somebody's looking for the guy. Give him credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems the United States has found over $1 trillion of untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan. And here's the great part. The country comes pre-invaded. ... We don't have to invade again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And besides the deposits of iron, copper, cobalt, and gold, they found the largest deposit of lithium ever discovered; most of it on land controlled by tribal communities. Wait a minute. Wasn't that the plot of 'Avatar'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in the Gulf region again today,&quot; having &quot;lunch at a local seafood restaurant. Horrible timing. A clam coughed up a tarball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry the show is on later than usual. It was delayed by the President's speech about the Gulf oil spill. Obama has been criticized for not doing enough. To be fair, he's been using every strategy in the book. Unfortunately, it's the same book President Bush used for Katrina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This spill... makes the Exxon Valdez look like a leaky juice box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know it's a real catastrophe when our biggest hope is Kevin Costner. I'm not kidding. Costner spent millions of his own money to develop a water-cleaning system&quot; that &quot;soaks up...oil-tainted water and spins it around and pumps out pure water at the other end. ... Director James Cameron is also helping out. He offered up his fleet of private submarines. ... If he's serious about cleaning up the spill, why doesn't he soak it up with his 'Avatar' money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was in Mississippi yesterday, President Obama ate mini crab cakes, fried shrimp and shrimp salad sandwiches to show Americans that seafood from the Gulf Coast is safe to eat. And if you don't believe Obama ate all that stuff, just ask our new president, Joe Biden. ... He'll tell you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also ordered a lemon-lime snow cone on the beach. A little awkward. Obama was like, 'Forget the oil spill for a minute. Can we figure out how to fix the leaks in the bottom of these paper cone things?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the oil spill, yesterday, BP ordered 32 oil-separating machines designed by Kevin Costner. ... Costner said, all along, a voice kept telling him, 'If you build it and there's a huge oil spill and the oil company and government have absolutely no idea whatsoever how to clean it up, they will come.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, earlier tonight, President Barack Obama unveiled his plans for the Gulf of Mexico and America's future energy needs. I was surprised, watching the speech tonight, when...both solutions turned out to be cars that run on oil-soaked pelicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little riddle for you. What's covered in heroin and sitting on a pile of gold? No, not Amy Winehouse. Well, not just Amy Winehouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the answer? Afghanistan! ... 'Reports now of potential newfound wealth for Afghanistan, a previously unknown yet massive amount of mineral deposits. The mother lode of iron, copper, cobalt, and gold could top out at nearly a trillion dollars.' Awesome! Congratulations, Afghanistan! You're...rich. You've got tons and tons of incredibly valuable natural resources buried beneath your surface. You will never not know war.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama delivered a primetime address on the oil spill. He said his Administration 'has been on top of the situation since day 51.' I mean, 'day one.' I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also declared that seafood in the Gulf was safe to eat, although he said if you 'really want to be safe, eat at Long John Silver's.' ... Luckily, batter has not been affected by the spill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama told the residents of the Florida coastal area that he is with them for the long haul, or at least until 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, President Obama met with that Tony Hayward guy and a couple of other BP executives. The meeting only lasted about 20 minutes, or, in BP terms, 10,000 barrels of oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids, Al Gore's marriage broke up because he was having an affair. ... Sources say it was hot and heavy. ... Apparently, she was hot, he was heavy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has bought more US debt. They know hold over $900 billion of US debt. A lot of Americans concerned about this because it's so much. ... Why are you concerned? It is not like we're going to pay them back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard During President Obama's Meeting With Tony Hayward:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'So, what's new?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Careful, you're getting oil all over the Oval Office.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Before I start kicking as#es, would any of you like some sparkling water?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Speaking of leaks, where's the men's room?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Thanks for giving my Administration something to worry about besides two wars, a crushing debt, global warming, and the worst economy in 70 years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Twenty billion?! Hell, I got that on me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Tony, I forgave you the second I heard that dreamy British accent.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Gotta keep this short. I'm meeting with the President of Indonesia about that smoking baby.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Biden, please, enough with the vuvuzela.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'How can we blame this on Bush and Cheney?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Barack Obama spoke from the Oval Office about his plan to clean up the oil spill. Did you folks get a chance to see it? Yeah. Well, I'm glad that problem's behind us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made a lot of promises that he can't possibly keep. I mean, it's like he's campaigning again, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He assured the nation that the Gulf will be cleaned up and restored to even greater beauty and prosperity. Well, you know what that means. He's started drinking. That's the only possible explanation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, right after the President's speech, Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, said that we should not demonize the oil companies. ... Well, I'm glad somebody's looking out for the little guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then today, the President met with...British Petroleum&quot; CEO Tony Hayward, and Obama was &quot;demanding that British Petroleum clean...up the Gulf. And I'm thinking, good luck. They can't even clean up their gas station restrooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said we need a new energy strategy, one with more alternatives, like solar power. I agree. But let's not forget about lunar power. Remember, the moon is what gives power to werewolves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I know Obama was trying to take the long view, but talking about solar energy in the middle of the oil&quot; spill is &quot;like watching your house engulfed in flames and saying, 'We really should change the curtains.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By this point, it's not even an 'oil spill' anymore. Spill is a little accident that can easily be cleaned up. Calling this a 'spill' is like calling World War II a 'tiff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's not the only one on the hot seat right now. The CEO of BP is taking a lot of flak. His name is Tony Hayward. ... Today, President Obama had a meeting with Hayward at the White House. It got off to the wrong start. Hayward arrived in a Hummer limo powered by baby seals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder how Obama began that meeting. 'Thanks for wrecking my Presidency, Tony. Want a water or something?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hayward... didn't take any questions after his White House meeting today. Probably a good thing. He's great at destroying ecosystems, but not so great at talking. Hayward&quot; has &quot;said...'No one wants this thing over more than I do. I'd like my life back.' ... Tony, I'm so sorry you had your summer disrupted. I'd buy you a drink, but you'd probably spill that too. And make me clean it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen. I'm not naive about large faceless corporations who destroy everything that's beautiful. I work here at CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that Hillary Clinton is now more popular than President Obama. Hillary was like, 'Look, I don't pay attention to the silly polls like that -- what were the numbers exactly?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, Hillary is more popular than Barack. ... They're separated by about ten points, or roughly one billion gallons of crude oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP had to stop collecting oil for a few hours yesterday after a bolt of lightning struck its ship in the Gulf, causing a fire. When asked for a comment, a spokesman for BP was like, 'So that's how things could possibly get any worse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama finally met with BP's CEO Tony Hayward, but the meeting was only scheduled 20 minutes. Call me crazy, but I think it should take more time to discuss an oil spill than it does to get your oil checked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, 'Top Chef DC' premieres tonight on Bravo. I love that show. But since it's in DC, the contestants don't actually cook, they just talk about what they're going to cook in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, President Obama announced that British Petroleum will set aside $20 billion to pay the victims of the oil spill in the Gulf. Well, that is good news. The bad news -- it still comes out to less than, like, a dollar a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These British Petroleum guys...can't do anything right. The chairman of BP, Carl-Henric Svanberg, told reporters that sometimes large oil companies are greedy and don't care, but 'not...BP. We care about the small people.' That's what he called the residents of the Gulf ? 'the small people.' But to be fair, English is not the guy's first language. Money is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the problem is I do believe they care about the small people. Problem is, they don't care about the big leak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the...CEO of BS -- is it BS? BP. I'm sorry. It's BP. I'm sorry. I don't know where I got BS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Hayward. You read about this guy? He's a little weasel guy. ... Well, he was testifying before -- why do they even call it testifying? Testi-lying, that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the sad part is, environmentalists say if this leak continues unabated, some species might become endangered, like Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the other oil companies are turning on BP. While testifying in Washington this week, Exxon executives blamed the Gulf oil spill on lapses by BP. See, that's when you know things are bad, when Exxon is lecturing you on oil safety, huh? That's like Heidi Montag saying, 'Just be yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen President Obama lately? People are saying he's dying his hair. Right there, that's a good use for the oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new bill in the Senate that is upsetting a lot of people. This bill would give the President the power to shut off the Internet. ... Al Gore is strongly opposed to it. Not because he invented the Internet. Because he did. But because he just signed up for Match.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday during a press conference, BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg caused some controversy when he said BP cares about the 'small people.' Part of his new strategy -- plug the hole by digging himself into a deeper one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP said that the comment was lost in transition from Svanberg's native Swedish to English. And the Americans were like, 'We get it. We've all tried to assemble something from IKEA. Apology accepted.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Washington, BP CEO Tony Hayward told members of Congress that his company is working to make sure that a spill like this does not happen again. And they have a great plan in place. They're going out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story ? it's day 59 of the siege on the Gulf,&quot; when &quot;Congress had its chance to take out its pent-up anger on...BP CEO Tony Hayward. But of course, before they did that, the CEOs from Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Conoco Phillips, and Chevron took to Capitol Hill to answer the questions, 'Gosh, would you guys have done this?' ... And the good news is, those oil companies do have contingency plans in the unlikely event of a spill. ... 'Several of the plans include an emergency contact for a Dr. Peter Lutz,'&quot; who &quot;'has been dead for five years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, oil guys, talk yourself out of this one. 'The fact that Dr. Lutz died in 2005 does not mean his work and the importance of his work died with him.' Right. But it does mean you can't call him anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with BP CEO Tony Hayward, otherwise known as 'the lying king.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, Hayward told Congress yesterday he's 'deeply sorry'...about the Gulf oil spill. He said he would have apologized sooner, but he was putting 100% of his energy trying to turn off that underwater video camera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a story that just stunned people. Texas Republican Congressman Joe Barton actually apologized to BP yesterday...for the way he felt they have been treated. ... Finally, somebody with the political courage to say what's on all our minds, huh? Yeah. Let's give BP a break. Boy, they've been through a lot. Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how stupid are you when you have the CEO of BP in the room and people think you're the moron?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, Cuba is bracing for effects of the leak, though a lot of Cubans say they can't wait for the oil to get there. They're hoping to use it as a Slip 'n Slide to sneak into Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, yesterday was the 38th anniversary of the Watergate break-in,&quot; when &quot;Republicans broke into Democratic headquarters, looking for their long-term plans and strategies.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors now that the CEO of British Petroleum is saying they could go out of business. ... And I thought, well, yeah, great. But if they go out of business, who will be in charge of not stopping the leak?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that NASA says there's 100 times more water on the moon than they first thought? In fact, there is so much water on the moon that BP is planning to go up there...and ruin it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I'm not going to do any jokes about oil spill related news. I thought it might be nice to just pretend for a few minutes that the oil spill isn't happening. You know, kind of like BP does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While testifying before Congress, BP's CEO Tony Hayward called the oil spill a 'complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures.' Then he realized he was reading notes left on the stand by a Goldman Sachs executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was on the Fox Business Network and surprised a lot of people by calling marijuana quote, 'a minimal problem in America.' She said law enforcement has more important priorities than arresting people smoking pot in their homes and also admitted that she herself has tried pot, which...could explain some of the things that she's said over the years. It's not Sarah, it's old baked Alaska talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was shocked that a woman who named her children Willow, Piper, and Trig and married a snowmobiler would be pro-marijuana. ... You would never expect that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because&quot; of the &quot;success&quot; of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, Pixar &quot;is now rushing ahead with its plans to do a sequel to one of their most popular movies, presented by BP. It's BP presents...'Try Finding Nemo Now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know something, as if these poor people in the Gulf weren't angry enough, you see what&quot; BP CEO Tony Hayward &quot;did over the weekend? He flew back to England to race one...of his yachts in the pristine, crystal clear waters off the coast of England. His yacht is named BOB, B-O-B, which stands for 'British Oil Bastard,' I believe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Hayward on a yacht. Where are the Somali pirates when you need them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, oh, when he heard this, oh, he was furious. President Obama got so mad, he almost couldn't finish his round of golf. That's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, I tell you, I think it's hurting him. President Obama is losing support from his own party over the way he's handling this BP situation. You want to know how bad it is, today, Jimmy Carter compared him to Jimmy Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has revealed she has tried marijuana, but she did not like it. You know, it's amazing: 200 million Americans have smoked marijuana. The only ones who don't like it seem to be elected officials. Ever notice that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bet that's what John McCain was smoking when he picked her. It all makes sense now. Of course!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and how stupid is this. You know, this state is so broke, they're just trying to make money any way they can. California lawmakers -- this is real -- are now considering a bill to allow electronic license plate frames on vehicles that will flash digital commercials. ... Who is this for? People who want something else to read while driving and texting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways Tony Hayward Can Improve His Image:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Catch Osama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Contaminate waters around a country like North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Reveal secret behind his soft and lustrous curly hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Apologize on The Golf Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Shoot new BP commercial where he viciously is pecked by angry pelicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Join team Coco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Get a job at Poland Spring; accidentally dump a billion gallons of water into the Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Improve his image, are you kidding? He's doing great!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Hang out at BP station, let customers inflate his a*s with air hose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dial it back from 'arrogant bastard' to 'smug pr***'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are kind of upset with British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward. ... Over the weekend, he was out on his yacht. And when President Obama found out that...Tony Hayward was on his yacht, he was so angry, he missed a putt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his defense, Tony twittered...that the oil spill was still his top priority. And I think you know that a guy really cares when he tweets from his yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad? He was in court today. And here is where the guy screwed up. He didn't count on our army of alert t-shirt vendors. ... And I was thinking, well, it's too bad we didn't have them in the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faisal now faces a couple of charges, including attempted terrorism and conspiracy to double park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the whole oil mess has been going on, President Obama spent the weekend playing golf with Vice President Biden. ... Biden's handicap is 16 and Obama's handicap is Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also went to the White Sox-Nationals game this weekend and actually sang 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game.' ... However, critics were quick to point out that while his singing sounded good, it seemed like he really didn't say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while Obama was playing golf, BP CEO Tony Hayward actually spent his weekend at a ritzy yacht race, where he watched...his 52-foot yacht compete. ... If that's not bad enough, he was watching is it from his 100-foot yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's rumored that President Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, will leave the White House at the end of the year. He says the work is important to him, but he wants to spend more time screaming at his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently minted mortal Barack Obama got BP to put $20 billion in an escrow account to pay back all those impacted by the disaster. Good news, for almost everybody. 'The President and I disagree on this escrow fund.' 'There's a misreading of the Constitution and a misunderstanding of jurisdictional limits from this White House. Now it seems that it's all about extortion.' Yeah, you broke it, you bought it is not extortion, just like give a penny, take a penny is not stealing, or philanthropy. You know what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman is pushing a bill to give the President absolute power over the Internet in the event of a national security emergency. Under the legislation, the President would have a figurative kill switch to seize control of the Internet and shut it down.' Either Joe Lieberman is exceptionally worried about cyberterrorism or somebody has a sex tape he doesn't want the world to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds a little silly, but Lieberman maintains it's necessary in the event that our communications structure comes under attack. And he's got, I think, a really good argument for it. 'Right now, China, the government, can disconnect parts of its internet in the case of war. We need to have that here, too.' Oh, see, I was worried about the potential government overreach and government censorship, but if China says it's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I have been a huge fan of the World Cup ever since I heard the US might win a game.&quot; But on &quot;Friday, we were fighting back from a 2-0 deficit to tie Slovenia when&quot; a &quot;goal was disallowed&quot; by a referee &quot;from Mali. ... This call was totally unfair, and the rest of the world agrees. 'It was a real injustice.' 'It was bad refereeing.' ... The US hasn't felt this much global goodwill since 9/11, and folks, we cannot let it go to waste. It is time to invade somebody. How about Mali?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am pretty sure that there is a Nobel Prize in my future because I have discovered an inexhaustible source of renewable energy: My rage at BP. ... This Saturday...BP CEO Tony Hayward took time out from his busy schedule of making turtles extinct to attend a yacht race in England. No wonder he wanted his life back, because it looks pretty sweet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, everybody hates Tony, which is bad news for Texas Congressman Joe Barton, because last Thursday he said this to Hayward. 'I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown. I apologize.' Then, to secure his popularity, Barton punched an orphan with a boxing glove made of kittens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, what Barton said shocked the nation. Even Republicans like John Boehner backed away so fast, you'd think Barton had said it in Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Barton then apologized for his apology. 'I want the record to be absolutely clear that I think BP is responsible for this accident. If anything I've said this morning has been misconstrued in opposite effect, I want to apologize for that misconstrued misconstruction.' Coincidentally, Misconstrued Misconstruction is also the name of the company that BP hired to build the well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is clearly a shakedown, folks. No oil company would ever voluntarily do the right thing. This $20 billion escrow account is a violation of cashtitutional rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'You've also got the aspect of, in this particular instance, a President actually, more or less, ordering this company to set aside $20 billion without their due process of court.' 'You can't asset strip and liquidate a company on the nod of the President. There has to be some due process.' ... 'There's no due process.' No due process. That is a violation of the Constitution. You can't just seize $20 billion and lock it away without a trial. It's not like it's a person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now luckily...Tony Hayward is. So, Obama, do the right thing, let that money go, and lock up Jeeves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is being criticized now. Here's the problem. The British Petroleum guy, Tony Hayward,&quot; was &quot;on his yacht&quot; recently. Everybody &quot;thought, whoa, this idiot. I mean, the Gulf of Mexico is turning to asphalt and the British Petroleum guy is relaxing on his yacht.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in Obama's defense, people are saying, 'Wait a minute, the President has always had his own particular way of relaxing.' For example, George W. Bush had his way of relaxing. He was President. That's how he relaxed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General McChrystal was relieved of his duties because of derogatory comments he made about President Obama and other White House staffers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today, although he admires McChrystal's service and dedication to his country, he said, 'You don't criticize your bosses.' Okay, that's the same reason President Obama never says anything bad about the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the bad news for McChrystal is he got fired for insulting the President. But the good news is, Fox said, 'We'll hire him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden arrived in the Gulf today to survey the oil spill. I'm like, haven't these poor people suffered enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's day 71 of the oil spill...in the Gulf of Mexico. They just did a poll that says only 6% of Americans have a favorable view of BP, to which I say, 6% of Americans have a favorable view of BP? That's 18 million people. Is it possible that 18 million Americans don't know what the word favorable means?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP is running with this, I guess. ... Their company newsletter&quot; has &quot;an article that says most Gulf residents aren't upset with BP because their clean-up crews have boosted the local economy. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I remember correctly, it's been a little while since we've heard from Vice President Joe Biden. I assume that's no accident. Here's the lengths the Administration is going to keep him under wraps. This week, they sent him to Milwaukee. ... His big diplomatic mission? Buying frozen custard. Even Biden can't blow this one. 'Where's the ice cream?! 'It's custard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gaffe. Did you hear that? He called frozen custard ice cream. I can't believe he's a heartbeat away from the presidency. Oh well, I guess it's back to the undisclosed location for ? wait. There's more? ... Play the rest of the clip. 'What do we owe you?' ... 'Lower our taxes and we'll call it even.' 'Why don't you say something nice instead of being a smart a#@ all the time?' ... You know, I've got to say, as Biden gaffes go, it ain't no tellin' a guy in a wheelchair to stand up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real issue here is why Biden even bothered to the answer. You're the Vice President. This guy's workin' at a custard shop. I know it's tempting to want to shoot back at him. But, did you ever think maybe that's why your handlers had you holding a custard in your hand in the first place? The perfect item to perhaps shove in your pie hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He forgot he still had a show. 7. Wants to focus on his second career as a barn owl. (Editor's note: Split screen image of Larry King and a barn owl were shown by the program.) 6. It's not easy juggling a television show, marriage, and an affair with your wife's sister. 5. Suspender rash. 4. Lately, introduces every guest as the 'lovely Ms. Carol Channing.' 3. Couldn't handle pressure of coming up with questions like, 'What's your favorite lunch meat?' 2. Well, there's this. (Editor's note: Program showed videotape of Larry King stuttering, trying to say 'E. coli.') 1. He needs time to plan his divorce.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Forget about the fact that we've been in Afghanistan since before Obama was even a gleam in the Senate's eye.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday, of course, the Fourth of July, recognized our independence from the British. Back in 1776, Americans were fighting to escape British rule. Of course, today, we're fighting to escape British oil. So...the struggle continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was talk the Democrats are going to try and pass an immigration bill this year, but it looks like that's not going to happen. It's kind of ironic.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new unemployment numbers are here! 'The government said the unemployment rate dropped...but the economy, still losing jobs, 125,000 in June.' ... Imagine if we hadn't had the stimulus. 'It's hard to argue...things would have been a lot worse. ... People kind of say, 'Yeah but unemployment's still at 9.6.' 'Yes, but it's not 12 or 13 or 15.' Yes. I believe we can all agree as Americans, there are many numbers bigger than nine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at least the unemployed still have their benefits, which will help them keep their heads barely above water. 'The House passed a bill to extend unemployment benefits, but the Senate...failed by a single vote, then went home for a long Fourth of July recess.' ... Extending benefits to jobless people seems like such a no brainer. What possible argument could you make against it? ... 'Continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work.' You hear that, people who have lost their jobs and are skating by on your $1200 a month?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story is Bristol and Levi will be getting their own reality show. I think it's going to be called, 'No, We Won't Just Go Away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China announced this week they have successfully slowed down the runaway growth of their economy. The way they slowed it down? By investing in our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced this week that the stimulus package saved three million jobs. ... The package was $862 billion, which means it cost us $287,000 per job. You know what we should have done? Write a check to those three million people for $187,000 each. They could have stayed home for the summer and we would have saved $300 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you know the very first atomic bomb was tested on this day in 1945 in New Mexico? It was top secret. ... So apparently, it was a lot easier to keep a secret back then. I mean, how do you keep an atomic bomb explosion a secret? I mean, Mel Gibson can't even keep his phone conversations secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York appeals court has just overturned the FCC's right to regulate the amount of obscene language on broadcast television. So finally, some good news for Mel Gibson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, BP May now face a seven-year off-shore drilling ban. ... In response, BP said, 'What are we supposed to do for seven years, sit there like idiots and do nothing all day? We can do that. We can do that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a rare earthquake in Washington, DC, this morning. ... At this point, I think God is just messing with Obama, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama was on vacation and this is his 65th vacation day since he's been in the White House,&quot; which &quot;means he's only 300 vacation days shy of tying George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a study by the Brookings Institute, Washington, DC, has the highest concentration of smart people in the United States. Let's see. We have a mess in the Gulf, we have a dysfunctional home security; we are $13 trillion in debt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is in Islamabad, Pakistan, today. Here's the odd part. You know what she's doing there? She's scouting locations for Chelsea's wedding. I was stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The countdown is...under way for what a lot of people are calling the wedding of the year: July 31st, Chelsea Clinton's getting married. Bill and Hillary...say they don't care who the groom is, as long as it's not Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has passed a new policy now that will protect the nation's oceans and coasts. Thank God, because you just don't want anything bad to happen. Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Sarah Palin, who was the governor of Alaska for a couple of years? ... She had a daughter who had a baby out of wedlock with a guy named Levi Johnston. ... And this is good news -- they're getting married. ... Bristol and Levi are getting married.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who will run for president? Jeb Bush. ... I feel the same way about Bush presidencies as I do about the 'Godfather' films. You're better off stopping at two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is speaking out, finally. She is opposing a plan to build a mosque...near the site of the World Trade Center. ... I don't know. You put a mosque there, there's no way the terrorists blow it up. If I was in charge, I'd put a mosque on top of every building in America, just to be safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin tweeted this on Sunday. She said, 'Ground Zero Mosque supporters: doesn't it stab you in the heart, as it does ours throughout the heartland?' Is Alaska part of the heartland? 'Peaceful Muslims, pls refudiate.' Now, I don't think refudiate is a word. And it wasn't a typo either, because she's used that word before. 'The President and his wife, the First Lady, spoke at NAACP so recently, they have power in their words. They could refudiate what it is that this group is saying.' She's like the Eskimo Don king. She makes up words.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comic book fans are gathering in San Diego&quot; for Comic-Con. A &quot;jock managed to get into&quot; the event and make &quot;off with more than $175,000 in lunch money. ... Speaking of guys who will beat you up for your lunch money, Governor Schwarzenegger spoke...yesterday&quot; in &quot;front of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which sounds like a fun group. And the Governor kept things light with a topical and hilarious joke. 'The good news is that BP has contained the oil leak. ... The bad news is that no one has figured out how to contain Mel Gibson.' He's still got it, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the comedy didn't stop there. The Governator also cracked wise on one of his favorite subjects, which is the importance of a daily workout. ... 'Just last week, I lifted 375 pounds. ... I lifted Rush Limbaugh out of the chair.' ... Right, because he's fat and you lifted him, out of 'the' chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, some bad news. Tonight's entire monologue turned up five hours ago on WikiLeaks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A website called WikiLeaks has posted 90,000 classified military documents about the war in Afghanistan. It's a huge deal. And the Pentagon is outraged. The White House is furious. And of course, British Petroleum, relieved. 'Finally, a leak that has nothing to do with us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an internal investigation launched by BP themselves -- well, they determined that British Petroleum is not at fault for the giant oil leak. BP has cleared BP. So, I guess we all owe them a huge apology, huh? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know who they said was responsible? Lindsay Lohan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP now getting rid of their chief executive guy, Tony Hayward. And they're giving him $23 million to leave. You know, I got a better idea. Don't give him any cash whatsoever. Eighty bucks a barrel, something like that? Give him a skimmer, a plastic hat, there's 30,000 barrels, all you scoop up, you can keep. Okay? Let's make it that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, though, I was thinking about this Tony Hayward guy. I mean, think about it. He's British. He's rich. He's hated. I think we found a replacement for Simon Cowell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum has announced that as a result of their own internal investigation, it has cleared itself of all blame in the Gulf oil spill. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward...got fired. ... British Petroleum is sending him to a project in Siberia. He wants to go to a part of the planet that hasn't yet been ruined. He wants to go there and see if he can't ruin it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who is going to be on 'The View' on Thursday? President Obama will be on 'The View.' ... I predict after 10 minutes on 'The View,' he'll call General Petraeus to send in more troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going on a 10-day vacation to Martha's Vineyard in August. Obama was like, 'This is my longest vacation ever.' And voters were like, 'Wait 'til you see the one we're planning for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP announced today...they will replace Tony Hayward as CEO. ... They are offering him a spot running their operation in Siberia. For real.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin with explosive news. 'Secrets are out about the war in Afghanistan.' ... So, top secret? 'We just came from an off camera session with...a Pentagon spokesman. He says it looks to be secret in nature, not top secret.' Oh, just secret. I was worried. I thought it was top secret. That's a much lower classification. It goes secret, top secret, and I believe, of course, pop secret. That is where all of our military information is encoded in fluffy and delicious butter coated kernels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was absolutely thrilled to hear that while I was on vacation, BP finally capped the Gulf oil spill. ... That is a cause for celebration. But if you're in the Gulf, please, no fireworks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is even more big news about BP. ... 'Fox News has confirmed BP CEO Tony Hayward will step down.' That's right. Tony Hayward has been resigned. He's looking forward to spending more time saying insensitive things to his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the oil spill has ended. So there's nothing to worry about, except, the Wiki spill. 'WikiLeaks is publishing what it says is more than 90,000 US military reports filed about the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2009: Raw data from the front line, a day-by-day unvarnished view of the war by US soldiers themselves.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama will appear on 'The View'&quot; tomorrow, thus &quot;becoming the first sitting president ever to be on a daytime talk show. He's going to talk to the ladies about the economy. Then later on, he will go on 'General Hospital' and explain to the doctors how the new healthcare system works. Finally, he'll end up doing a makeover on Tyra Banks. So it's going to be a big day...for the President.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona's new immigration law...has given birth to a new state slogan: 'What happens in Arizona stays in Mexico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, actually,&quot; a Federal &quot;judge issued an order blocking the most controversial part of the new immigration law from going into effect tomorrow. Police will not be asking undocumented workers for their papers. So, in a related story, Wal-Mart today said the job fair will continue as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just hours before it was supposed to take effect,&quot; the &quot;law was blocked by US District Judge Susan Bolton, which means she either thinks the law is unconstitutional, or she hasn't been able to find another nanny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is the interesting part. A hundred protesters gathered in front of the US Embassy in Mexico to wait for the judge's decision. And guards wouldn't let allow them on the grounds because the embassy is considered US land. Kind of ironic, isn't it? The only US land people from Mexico aren't allowed in is in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Embattled Congressman Charlie Rangel is said to be working out a deal with the House Ethics Committee. See, only in Congress can you work out a deal with the Ethics Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continental Airlines announced today a new feature called self-boarding. There's no ticket agent taking your boarding pass anymore. You scan your own boarding pass. You board the plane. You get on, there is nobody there. This is part of Continental's 'Terrorists Fly Hassle Free' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! ... Sounds like illegal immigrants are here, and you can stay in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, because of this new law, a lot of illegals have fled the state and gone back to their homeland, Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, today, the same day this new anti-immigration law went into effect, Arizona made it legal to carry a concealed weapon without any training or a permit. So, if you're illegal&quot; and &quot;working the night shift at the Phoenix Wal-Mart to support your family, get the hell out of there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was a guest on 'The View' today. ... Then later in the afternoon,&quot; he &quot;went over to 'The Maury Povich Show.' He passed the lie detector test. Turns out he was born in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said he had a good time on 'The View.' He said surprisingly, the ladies there talk a lot less than Joe Biden, so it wasn't so bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were some surprise questions. Joy Behar asked the President about Snooki...from 'Jersey Shore.' Well, President Obama said he didn't know who she was, which is okay, because Snooki doesn't know who he is either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, according to those leaked Pentagon documents -- listen to this -- Pakistan once plotted to kill an American diplomat with poison beer. I didn't even know they sold Pabst Blue Ribbon over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, despite the CIA claims that they cannot find Osama bin Laden, these WikiLeak documents say he was seen several times in the last couple years, and according to one report, he was seen attending monthly meetings in Pakistan. Here&quot; the weird part. They were Amway meetings. ... He was trying to get a distributorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea Clinton's getting married this weekend. And Bill said, 'I'm going to try not to cry when walking her down the aisle.' Actually, the last time Clinton cried at a wedding&quot; was &quot;his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Jeb Bush Isn't Running For President:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Too busy with his daily routine: Gym, tan, laundry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Huckabee already has a lock on the 'pasty fat guy' vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Leaves voicemail messages that make Mel Gibson sound like a choir boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Scared of Lincoln's ghost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Wants to be 'American Idol' judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Wasn't blessed with Bush family stammer (Editor's note: Program played video tape of Bush stammering, 'Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme.')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For some reason, he'd rather not inherit two wars, massive debt and an ocean full of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. No governor siblings to help him rig the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we have&quot; anybody from Arizona &quot;here? ... This new immigration law went into effect...I believe earlier today. And it may not mean much to us but I mean I'm telling you, the Diamondbacks had to replace their entire bullpen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they're serious. Today, out there in Arizona, they swapped 10 illegal aliens for four Russian spies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama goes on 'The View.' And, you know, his critics are saying this guy is unwilling to confront radical extremists.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama went on 'The View' yesterday and got something he hasn't had in years -- high ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says his new message to the American people is things could be a lot worse. Well, that's inspiring, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, better than saying, 'Hey, the end isn't that near. Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several hundred demonstrators opposed to Arizona's new immigration law marched to Phoenix's courthouse yesterday. And on the way there, they picked up a couple hundred more at the Home Depot parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the people were protesting this new law, SB-1070. They want to replace it with bill WD-40. This allows illegals to slip in and out of the state whenever they want, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Charlie Rangel has reportedly struck a deal with the congressional ethics panel. You know what that means. Time to start investigating the ethics panel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Rangel has been accused of 13 ethics violations. But see, politicians. His explanation was...he may have just been overzealous in serving the public. Remember the last time a politician was overzealous helping you? ... Maybe overzealous lying to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea's wedding is this weekend. ... Doesn't that sound like the ultimate chick flick? Didn't Julia Roberts marry Hugh Grant in that one? 'Chelsea's Wedding.' Sounds like it should be on the double bill with 'The Notebook.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the rumor is Chelsea will be wearing Hillary's old wedding dress. Now, Bill said today he doesn't remember Hillary's dress. He remembers what the maid of honor was wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The seating plan at a wedding like this is very tricky. ... For example, you don't mix political adversaries. Like, you can't put CNN reporters...next to Fox News reporters. And whatever you do, don't put Al Gore near any massage therapists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This story doesn't seem to want to go away. It seems Portland police reportedly interrogated Al Gore last Thursday, about allegations that he sexually abused a massage therapist back in 2006. And of course, being Al Gore, the light they shined in his face when they interrogated him...was a low wattage, long life, energy efficient bulb. They wanted to be extra green.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;RadarOnline is reporting that Bristol Palin may call off her wedding to Levi Johnston after she found out his ex-girlfriend is pregnant, and he may be the father. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, want to give our best wishes to Chelsea Clinton. As you know, she got married on Saturday. So, that was very nice. And I tell you, it was a very emotional time for Bill and Hillary, because as you know, they hadn't seen each other in years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody looked beautiful. Did you see Hillary? She wore a dress. I mean, it was...over her pantsuit, but it looked great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I didn't realize as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had this much power. Did you see the wedding gift she gave to the new couple? New Zealand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am stunned that people are not more upset about this. You know $8.7 billion...of our money has gone missing in Iraq. I didn't even know they had a Goldman Sachs over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this. Goldman Sachs has told all their employees now that obscene words will no longer be allowed in any more office e-mails, because at Goldman Sachs, obscene words include integrity, trust, fairness, hard work, honesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the government, the number of Amish people has increased by 10% in just the last two years. ... Those aren't Amish people, okay? Those are people who had their power shut off and cars repossessed, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're sitting around growing beards because they don't have jobs. They are not Amish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and here's a frightening story. Three convicted murderers escaped from a prison in Arizona, but the governor of Arizona...told the people, 'There's no need to worry. All three murderers are American citizens, so we are safe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snooki, from&quot; MTV's &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; got &quot;in trouble. She punched a cop or something like that. ... President Obama stepped in. And...here's what he did. He invited them both to the White House for a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of the United States has no idea who Snooki is. I find that comforting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea Clinton...got married over the weekend. ... I'm beginning to think maybe I'm not getting an invitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen photos of the event? It looked lovely. I mean, Hillary was there. She was wearing a strapless pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, Bill had his attorneys add some wiggle room to the wedding vows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was funny, at one point Bill Clinton...accidentally backs into an ice sculpture at the reception and he goes, 'Whoa, Hillary!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with a bit of media news. You may remember that a seat in the White House press room became available a few months back when Helen Thomas...retired after telling Jews to leave Palestine and go back home to Germany. ... Ironically, Thomas' retirement led to a territorial dispute over who would get her tiny, purely symbolic piece of land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several organizations put in bids for the front row seat. Ladies and gentlemen, who gets it? ... 'Fox News has a front row seat on the Obama Administration.' Fox News! Finally in the front row! Oh, so that's why they get much...wrong. They couldn't hear. They were too far back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Thomas seat replacement is the biggest story to come out of White House press room since 2006, when they broke the huge story about the remodeling of the White House press room. So, White House press room, still America's number one source of news, about the White House press room.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to start off by saying happy birthday to President Barack Obama. He is...49, which is eight points higher than his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you would like to get him a gift, he's registered at Bed, Bath, and Blame it on Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the cake they had for him? He had a huge cake. A little different than most birthday parties. What he did was he didn't blow out the candles, he just taxed them until they finally gave up and went out on their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raul Castro, brother of Fidel Castro, said on Sunday that his government will scale back on control on small businesses. It will lay off unnecessary workers and allow more self-employment. So, apparently, he sees how bad socialism is working in America. He doesn't want it to happen there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways Barrack Obama Celebrated His Birthday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Sent troops to invade a Cold Stone Creamery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Read details of his surprise party on Wikileaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Got a new fake birth certificate he wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Read 'Eat Pray Love' and bawled his eyes out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Asked birthday party magician if he could make Sarah Palin disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Fist-bumped with Snooki and The Situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Went to Pizzeria Uno for their 'Shrimp &amp; Crab Fun-Doo' with the guys from NORAD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Flew Air Force One to Party Depot to buy helium balloons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. .Sat alone watching 'Real Housewives' marathon on Bravo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Stuffed Tony Hayward full of nickels and beat him like a pi?ata.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to President Barack Obama. Today, the President is 49 years old. ... He blew out all his candles and wished for his old job back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's 49 years old and I want to tell you something -- and believe me, I'm no political expert -- but it's&quot; not a &quot;good sign when your age is higher than your political approval rating. Never a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight in Washington. As you know, we talk a lot on this program about how Congress can be somewhat ineffectual or short-sighted or ignorant or a feted pool of corruption and stupidity located at the intersection of Entitlement Avenue and Abject Dereliction Of Duty Lane. I'm sorry, what are we talking about again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ah, Congress! Credit where credit is due. Last week the House of Representatives took up a pressing issue with bipartisan support. ... 'Mr. Speaker, our committee can do great work when we work together.' Yes we can! And what better reason to work together than on a bill providing health care for 9/11 first responders and relief workers currently suffering chronic health problems directly related to their brave service? It's one of Congress' finest hours. But I'm sorry, sir, I cut you off. Continue. ... 'This is not one of our finest times.' Hey, what the ? What?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the President's 49th birthday. And, of course, Democrats are using it to drum up support by holding birthday events around the country, including a 'presidential potluck' in Phoenix, '49 Candles for America' party in Des Moines, and a Hawaiian luau in Austin, Texas. And Honolulu, I assume, will reciprocate by holding a dolphin rodeo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, when I want the latest news on Fox News, I turn to Fox News. ... 'MSNBC and CNN on Wednesday received terrible ratings while Fox News dominated, as usual.' They tout their ratings so much, I'm surprised they don't slap a blonde wig on them and give them their own show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I was surprised that Fox didn't cover the recent story that a full 1.38% of their audience is black. That's 29,000 viewers. Personally, I had no idea so many African Americans were terrified of Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I've had my research team...break down those numbers. Of those 29,000 black viewers, it appears 45% are trapped in the waiting room of a Jiffy Lube, 7% are white people who just enjoy watching Fox News in black face, 25% said Glenn Beck's name three times in the mirror and his show appeared, and the remaining 23% is Juan Williams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama turns 49 today. Finally, his numbers went up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you all familiar with the 14th Amendment? ... That's the one that says anyone born in the United States is a citizen. If your parents jumped over the fence and you were born here, you are a citizen. ... Well, a lot of people are trying to repeal it. And now, Senator John McCain says he now supports holding hearings on overturning the 14th Amendment, which is kind of odd, because when it passed back in 1866, McCain actually voted for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less than half of American workers hold on to a job for four years or more,&quot; which is &quot;bad news for President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know it was this week in 1861 the first Federal income tax was instituted to pay for the Civil War. Of course, these days, we don't worry about that kind of stuff. Our wars are now paid for by our grandchildren. We're in good shape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, listen to this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama...has a new book out. ... May have seen this: 'Spain On $75,000 A Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a recent interview on Fox News, Sarah Palin said she thinks President Obama is in over his head. And believe me, when it comes to being in over your head, this woman knows what she is talking about, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exxon's profits last quarter are nearly double what they were the same time last year. Well, petroleum experts say it's because of their new slogan, 'Hey, We're Not BP.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the number of Americans receiving food stamps has risen to a record 40.8 million. And experts say, without this assistance, many Americans would find obesity out of reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Postal Service reported a $3.5 billion loss in the last quarter. They lost $3.5 billion, thus establishing themselves as the Federal government's most successful enterprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A postal expert said today eventually the post office could turn a profit if this email thing turns out to be just a fad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and remember that little girl we talked about last week with the lemonade stand? Remember the...seven-year-old girl? Remember she had a lemonade stand shut down by the authorities because she didn't get a $120 business license. Well, the good news is the city has allowed the girl to switch to a more legitimate business. She's now opened a medical marijuana dispensary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to AARP magazine, dyeing you hair gray is the hottest trend among young celebrities like Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, and Pink. And believe me, when it come to tracking hot trends among young people, you can't beat AARP magazine. Oh, they've got their finger on the pulse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama celebrated his birthday by playing basketball with...LeBron James...and a lot of other NBA stars. ... And the President started off strong. Then halfway through the game, people became disappointed with his performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point, President Obama turned to LeBron James and said, 'Man, you're lucky. They only hate you in Cleveland.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was like a real NBA game. Once there was a blowout, they emptied the bench and put the white dude in: Joe Biden. That dude talks smack and never shuts up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kobe Bryant was there. He played, but at the cookout afterwards, never passed the barbecue sauce.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The...First Lady and her daughter, Sasha, just returned from a vacation in Spain that cost, get this, $80,000 a day. Who the hell did they go with? Diddy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle said she wanted to expose her daughter to the Spanish culture. Why doesn't she do what everyone else does? Get a nanny.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reggie Bush and the entire team were there. It was like the old days. You had a mess in New Orleans, the economy in a recession, and a Bush in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's top economic advisor -- a woman named Christina Romer -- announced she is leaving. They say she'll probably go back to teaching. Well, you know what they say: 'Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Wall Street Journal' says there's a movement growing to replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the Democratic ticket in 2012. ... In response, Hillary said, 'Come on, that is just silly. Make it so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A growing number of Democrats want President Obama to replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton as a running mate in 2012. And by growing number of Democrats, I mean President Obama and Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston is going to run for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, in a new reality show. The show is called, 'Who Wants to be Mayor of Wasilla,? Seriously, Anybody? We Just Need Someone with a Pulse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which amendment is trying to kill us? At first, I was sure it was the second. That's where the guns are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no, this threat is lurking up in the double digits, in the most sinister amendment of them all. ... 'A growing number of Republicans are calling for dumping the 14th Amendment, revoking the citizenship of people born in this country if one of their parents is an illegal immigrant.' 'The 14th Amendment -- Lindsey Graham, among others, is proposing that we repeal the provision where you get automatic citizenship if you are born in the country.' 'The 14th Amendment was written and passed, I think, in 1868, at a time when we had no immigration law.' And that's a good thing. If there was immigration law, the Indians could have had us deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the world champion New Orleans Saints visited the White House earlier this week. You probably saw this. They presented President Obama with a Saints jersey with the number 44 on it, in honor of his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, a year ago, the President's numbers were above 70&quot; and Tiger Woods' &quot;numbers were below 70. Now, they've changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there's been a lot of criticism over President Obama's -- what they're calling his 'sports week.' Last Saturday he played golf.

They said everyone needs leisure time and thanks to these economic policies, 9.5% of all Americans have all the leisure time they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supposedly in the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger ? he's only in it for about five minutes -- but he accomplishes more in those five minutes than he did in his entire time as the governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a little vacation over the weekend, on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The President and his family spent just over 24 hours in the Gulf. Some Republicans are actually attacking him for not staying longer. They do have a point. President Bush, for instance, used to vacation for weeks and weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is trying to help tourism on the Gulf after the oil spill. He even jumped into the Gulf to prove it was safe. Unfortunately, he did a cannonball right on to a pelican. Nothing goes right for this guy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is him. 'You don't believe the water's clean? How about I pull my 9-year-old daughter into it? Sasha, do not swallow, you understand me? Do not let a drop of this filth into your mouth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously in this day and age, Muslims will take any reason to party, especially in the face of continuing controversy over the so-called 'Ground Zero mosque.' It's an issue on which the President himself weighed in on Friday. 'I understand the emotions that this issue engenders, and Ground Zero is indeed hallowed ground. But let me be clear. As a citizen and as President, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country.' Boom! Religious freedom. ... You can't be any more clear than that. ... Usually when Obama says the 'let me be clear,' he's about to get...very unclear. ... Usually, he says, 'Let me be clear. There is no way I would not un-support the kind of project this isn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...that's not what this was. This was the principled guy that people ? I'm sorry? There's more? Okay. 'I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there.' Oh. Well, that's walking it back a little bit there. That kind of reminds me actually of his campaign slogan, 'Yes We Can, But Should We?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you all had a fun weekend. I did and the President certainly did. He went for a swim in the Gulf of Mexico. Then, I assume the Secret Service scrubbed him off with Dawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After that he played mini-golf, and Sasha got a hole in one. Yes. An adorable attack on small business owners, forcing them to foot the bill for her free game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then let's see. Took his family on a boat ride. Got some ice cream and, oh, yeah, he endorsed jihad! 'I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan.' You know what? I've been wrong, and I owe the President an apology. You're not a secret Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can cite the Constitution and the Bill of Rights all you want, but what about our Gutstitution and the Bill of Frights? ... Technically, Muslims have constitutional rights, but since 9/11, we gave up a ton of our constitutional rights -- search and seizure, trial by jury, habeas corpus. I don't even know what that last one means. I think it's the Little Caesar's mascot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of all...we have given up the right to privacy. I can't make a phone call without hearing Dick Cheney breathing on the line. He still uses lungs, right? Okay. Good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, after 9/11, the intelligence community realized they failed to connect the dots. So they came up with the simplest answer -- more dots, please. 'The money spigot was just opened after 9/11, and nobody dared say, 'I don't think we should be spending that much.&quot; 'The intelligence community is apparently larger, much larger: 1,271 government organizations comprise our intelligence community; 1,931 private companies are tied to it.' 'There are 854,000 people with top secret security clearance.' More people have top secret security clearance than have Pop Secret security clearance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, these are dangerous times. That's why we need the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Counterterrorism Center, the National Drug Intelligence Center, the Office of Intelligence Support, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Information Security Oversight Office, and, of course, the National Bureau of On-Screen Graphic Overload.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, folks, we are now protected by so many secret programs that the incoming Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, 'There's only one entity in the entire universe that has visibility on all (programs) -- that's God.' That means God's a spy! That's why he's always undercover as a burning bush or a grilled cheese sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our analysts have to keep up with a massive flow of data. The NSA alone processes 1.7 billion electronic intercepts per day, and that's just from Kanye West's Twitter page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, the system is clearly working. As retired general John Vines says, 'Because it lacks a synchronizing process...we consequently can't effectively assess whether it is making us more safe.' Which means it's making us more safe. You see, if our enemies infiltrate our spy networks, they, like us, will have no...idea what is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, I am calling on Congress to make our intelligence system even larger with a new agency to monitor our existing agencies: The National Central Homeland Surveillance Bureau of Intelligence Agencies Agency. The NCHSBIAA, or Inchisbiaa, whose great seal features an eagle looking up its own a#@.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number one movie at the box office this weekend was 'The Expendables.' Or as in Arizona, they like to call them, 'the Mexicans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite part of the movie ? there's one scene between Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger that needed to have subtitles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows you how bad the California economy is. Even the Governor has to have two jobs!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger hasn't acted in a long time. Hasn't acted on the economy, on jobs, on education...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing unrealistic about the movie -- whites, Asians, and blacks hanging out together. Where do you see that? Only in the unemployment line.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a great deal of excitement here in Los Angeles this week. President Obama paid us a visit. ... He was here for a star-studded fundraiser held at the home of John Wells. They raised one million dollars and converted him to scientology, so it was a success.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what's the 'gaping hole in our security'&quot; that &quot;Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert&quot; is &quot;so worried about? 'Explosive claim that pregnant foreigners are coming here to give birth to future terrorists. Babies with US citizenship under the 14th Amendment who will then be raised and trained overseas and to come back...20 or 30 years from now and attack us.' ... That's your gaping hole? ... Have a baby here, take it away for 20 years to raise it as a terror baby to then have it come back and attack us. That's...not&quot; a &quot;hole in security. That's the new Will Ferrell movie, 'Baby Make a Boom Boom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm sure that Rep. Gohmert realizes it's probably easier for a terrorist to recruit Americans than to count on terror babies doing what their parents want them to. Because, you know, when they become terror teens, they tune you out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is America, Louie. They got terror babies? Guess what we got? ... Hero babies! Take your best shot, terror babies,&quot; because hero &quot;babies don't run! Yet. About a year and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, a new approach to solving the immigration issue. We're all going to close our eyes and count to diez, and you all better be gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, illegal immigration has America dangling by a thread. We're like a giant pinata that Mexicans are hitting until we bust open and all our jobs spill out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, our country's most famous immigrant, Barack Obama -- and I hope I pronounced that name correctly -- he took a half-hearted swipe at the problem. 'President Obama signed a new $600 million border enforcement bill that sends 1,500 new agents to the Southwest border and pays for more unmanned drones to patrol it.' Big whoop. We've got 140,000 troops in Afghanistan and that place is still crawling with foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there are a few practical ideas to control the border out there, like this one from Rand Paul. 'I think you should actually put an electronic fence under the whole border.' Yeah. An electric fence under the border. We just need to get the Mexicans to wear those dog shock collars. Then, it would work. It's humane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then there are those whack job suggestions, like, 'Why don't you just stop hiring them and they'll stop coming here.' Come on! They're so cheap.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of dumb, a new poll finds that more and more Americans believe that President Obama is a Muslim. Almost one in five of us believe this. According to the poll, 43% didn't know what religion Obama is. Only 34% correctly said he's a Christian. Which is crazy ? remember...during the election, when all anyone could talk about was his crazy friend, Reverend Wright, and how he couldn't be trusted because he belonged to this guy's church for 20 years? What happened to that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's headed to vacation in Martha's Vineyard for 10 days. He's staying in a house that has an unobstructed view of the Atlantic Ocean, which just happens to be pointed in the direction of Mecca.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Islamic community center in downtown Manhattan has quickly become more than just a local problem. And it's sure to be a major political issue for the Democrats come November. But don't worry, they are all over it. 'There's no question that there's a concerted effort to make this a political issue by some. And I join...those who have called for looking into how is this opposition to the mosque being funded? How is this being ginned up?' So...your answer to attack on freedom of religion is an investigation threatening to chill freedom of speech? ... What is wrong with you people? There is an all-you-can-eat buffet of things you could be saying and doing right now to win the hearts and minds of the country. And instead, you're acting like...Democrats.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This: 'It was the first day of shrimp season today. And for the first time since BP oil began seeping into Louisiana waters, the shrimp boats headed back to work.' Yes, it is shrimp season.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make sure I mention&quot; that on Saturday, Glenn Beck will host a rally at the Lincoln Memorial. Beck &quot;didn't intentionally schedule his rally...for the anniversary&quot; of Dr. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech,&quot; but it &quot;does turn out to be an absolutely appropriate synchronicity. 'This is about'&quot; the &quot;'things that Martin Luther King stood for -- the content of character, not the color of skin. But people have been acting as though no white man can mention or praise or support the mission of Martin Luther King.' ... Who acts like white people can't praise Martin Luther King? Or is it that they don't want people who...called Barack Obama, the first black president, a racist, to praise Martin Luther King? Because here's something that's never happened to me: 'Uh, Martin Luther King is one of my personal heroes.' 'Oh no you didn't! No you didn't, white boy!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's a tough job market out there. That's why I always try to keep you abreast of the latest job openings. And today, there is a big one. Fox News White House correspondent...Major Garrett has announced that he is leaving the network. Now, according to Garrett, he is leaving Fox News for the 'National Journal' because he wants to 'talk less' and 'think more.' So, if you're an unemployed reporter who likes to talk but does not like to think, Fox News is hiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Fox News, nation, I am brimming with anticipation. ... Because in just two days, Saturday, August 28th, Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor to America ceremony will be held in Washington, DC. And this isn't just some picnic. This is the picnic that changes everything. 'It may not change America tomorrow. ... I know it will in 25 years. Because somewhere, there will be an eight-year-old boy or girl that will rise to be the next George Washington.' Thanks to Glenn, some beautiful eight-year-old will grow up to be a hatchet-wielding, toothless slave owner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, no surprise, folks. The restoring honor haters out there are upset that Glenn is holding his 8/28 rally on the steps of the Lincoln memorial, the exact location and date of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. Well, big whoop: 8/28 is also the birthday of Jason Priestley. You don't see his panties in a bunch. Though, I wouldn't mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest polls, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has an approval rating of 59%. Very high. Experts say this is because he has put socialism behind him and improved the economy. In fact, it's worked so well, many Democrats in Congress are thinking of trying it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a report in 'Time' magazine, experts say that this recession...is good for people because fewer people drive to work, which means fewer deaths and auto accidents. Fewer people can afford to eat, so we don't gain as much weight. ... You know what that means? President Obama's economic plan is also his healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you...the economy is not good. Oh, the economy is so bad, today, President Obama had to play golf on a public course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the only housing stock in the United States now are mosques in New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the weekend, Glenn Beck and Al Sharpton both held rallies on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech back in 1963. How many have a dream both Glenn Beck and Al Sharpton will go away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And man, how about those 33 trapped miners down there in Chile? ... They have plenty of food and water, but they're saying the rescue could take three months. ... I had no idea BP was operating down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five years ago, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. ... Now, that's not to be confused&quot; with the Gulf disaster. Hurricane Katrina &quot;was not British Petroleum's fault. That was the other Gulf disaster. Completely different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend marked five years since Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. ... Back then, the economy was in a mess, there was a huge disaster in the Gulf, the President was on vacation when things were falling apart. Thank God that could never happen today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama spoke in New Orleans over the weekend to mark the fifth anniversary. One embarrassing moment -- halfway through his speech, FEMA finally showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with Brian Williams, President Obama said, 'I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would it make any difference if President Obama's birth certificate was on his head, huh? I mean, most of the people who want to see it can't read anyway, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well...Roger Clemens, forced to testify before Congress. Congress is very upset with Clemens, because they felt they were lied to. ... Good! Now you know how we feel!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something odd. I'm in Las Vegas over the weekend. ... You know the hotel complex New York, New York? You know what they're building in it? A mosque.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is in bad shape. ... The economy is so bad, stockbrokers who jump out the window now are asking for frequent flyer miles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you know the big story last night. In only his second Oval Office address, President Obama announced the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the speech last night, President Obama called former President George W. Bush. I'm not saying the economy is bad, but he called collect, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they had a pretty cordial conversation. President Bush said the last 19 months he has been relaxing and playing golf. President Obama said, 'You, too?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama...said there are too many Americans struggling to find jobs. You know what these Americans are going to be called? Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Miss Mexico, who has been crowned the new Miss Universe. ... Her family is so proud, they are now thinking of moving back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Archaeologists in Mexico think they may have finally determined why the Mayan Indians left their city so suddenly. Apparently there were jobs available at the Wal-Mart here in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that President Obama speech yesterday in Milwaukee. Do you remember that speech? Here's what happened. The President saw his shadow. Which means six more weeks of recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, listen to this, proposed a $50 billion job bailout. He wants to rebuild roads, $50 billion. Rebuild roads, going to rebuild runways, going to be rebuilding railway lines. Going to be rebuilding his presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all remember Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska. There is a article about her in a magazine that says she's a lousy tipper. ... I'll give you an example how cheap she is: Dinner for four, a steak dinner. She left only two pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand, you think 'Bad tipper? Wait a minute, I don't know' because a couple of years ago she gave back 20% of the vote to Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech in Milwaukee yesterday, president Obama complained that Republicans talk about him 'like a dog.' Then Biden got up to agree with him and Obama was like, 'Biden, sit!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of the Mideast peace talks, President Obama held a conference call with rabbis this afternoon. Yeah, Obama didn't get to say much, though, because we had to listen to, 'Oh, we have to wait for you Mr. Big Shot? You never call and when you do, you can't wait to get off the phone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats' problem isn't their ideas or their desperate strategy it's really that no matter what they do it doesn't (bleep) matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study has found -- this is what they say. The government says that making over $75,000 a year does not increase your happiness. To which President Obama said to Republicans, 'See!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in Cleveland today delivering his latest economic plan. He picked Cleveland because, see, those are the Browns fans, and in September they'll believe anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one awkward moment when the [President's] speech ended at lunchtime. 9.6% of the crowd had no jobs to go back to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has introduced a $50 billion plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. Now, let's think back, wasn't -- remember the first $787 billion stimulus package? Wasn't that what that was supposed to do? Remember we were told this is what they call 'shovel ready jobs'? Remember that? Remember that? So whenever Washington talks about shovel ready projects, get your shovel ready...because you're gonna be shoveling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starting today, travelers flying to the United States from certain countries will be required to pay a $14 entrance fee. 14 bucks to get into the United States. See, that's to keep out the riffraff. They do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP has just come out with their own report on the gulf oil spill. You hear about this? See who they're blaming it on? Reggie Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Center for Health Statistics has announced that the birthrate has dropped for the second year in a row. They say it's due to two factors -- the recession and, of course, Levi Johnston now wearing a condom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this story of this moron pastor in Florida who wants to have a 'Burn The Koran Day'? Well, now General Petraeus said this could cause problems for our troops in Afghanistan. This pastor claims he is going to talk to God before he decides what to do. How many think God has this guy on his do-not-call list?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Describes leadership style as a mix of Jefferson, Churchill, Blagojevich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. You get him on the phone and he barks like a dog. [Editor's note: Letterman held up a phone while barking was played] That's Gov. Patterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. At least once a week, wakes up naked on roof of the capitol building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Makes no secret of the fact that she entered politics to meet Justin Bieber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She resigned from running Alaska to work for Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is trying to back Republicans into a corner by paying for tax cuts on small businesses with tax hikes on big businesses. It's like that old trick when you take two balls, and throw one high in the air to distract your opponent. Then throw the other one right at his chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're for or against it, you have to agree choosing Cleveland to announce new taxes on the rich was a great move. Cleveland's a blue collar town. They're always up for pinching the nipples of rich dudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama also said in the speech he wants to close major tax loopholes for big oil companies. Which I'm like 'Oh, really taking a stand there, Mr. President.' Going after the oil companies, that is risky, isn't it? These days, oil companies are about as popular as Michael Vick at a dog show, I would say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's touring the country to push his $50 billion plan to rebuild roads and runways around the country to help get people working. The Department of Labor unveiled a new website to help people looking for jobs. The way it looks is, I went on it today, you register your information, you check off your aptitudes and the kind of work you're looking for, you scan the results and before you know it, another day of unemployment is behind you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BP &quot;released a big report with their explanation of what caused the millions of barrels of oil to flow into the Gulf of Mexico.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a weather update from Florida. This week's Quran smoke advisory has been lifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That crazy pastor down...in Florida -- remember, he was going to burn the Quran? ... He's now suspended&quot; that plan. He &quot;says, instead, he's now just going to rip up a couple of copies of the Watchtower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, have you heard this guy talk? ... He said he's now looking for direction from God on where to go. You know, I can't speak for God, but I think if he grabs a shovel and starts digging, he's heading in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Atlantic' had a big article on the inevitability of Israel going to war with Iran over building nuclear weapons. But the White House thinks that strong economic sanctions will bring them to their knees, raise unemployment, and cause their factories to close, the same way those economic sanctions work right here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy's in bad shape. The economy is so bad, women in Beverly Hills are now telling their real age just to get the AARP discount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that President Obama wasn't wearing his wedding ring during his White House press conference today. I guess that makes the press conference the second most difficult speech he's going to have to give this weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world is waiting nervously tonight as Florida pastor Terry Jones decides whether or not to burn copies of the Quran. He originally planned to burn them tomorrow, on September 11th. Then yesterday, he called it off because he believed he made a deal with an imam, which is a Muslim leader, to stop the plan to build a mosque near Ground Zero. The imam said that wasn't true, he agreed to no such thing. ... Jones said he was lied to, the burning was back on. This guy ? he's like the Brett Favre of burning books. He's back and forth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, the plan is to hold off on burning the Quran. Actually, they're...thinking of lightly toasting it with a George Foreman grill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even though nothing has happened and this guy is -- I hope the world realizes he's one nut from a church the size of a Sunglass Hut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is ? he's caused a lot of anger. There have been violent demonstrations in Afghanistan about this. Hundreds of people -- I saw one report said three protesters were injured and one was killed in one of these demonstrations. ... Aren't they all on the same side? Why is someone being killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of funny. Our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the robot -- made fun...of Sarah Palin on his Twitter page last night. Arnold was on his way to Asia. He posted a picture of himself looking out the window of his plane. ... And he wrote, 'Over Anchorage, AK. Looking everywhere but can't see Russia from here. Will keep you updated as search continues.' ... I think sometimes he forgets he's not really bulletproof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tough one for Sarah Palin, because not only is Schwarzenegger a fellow Republican, when she was a teenager, she had a Conan the Barbarian poster hanging on the wall of her igloo. So this really...hits home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new report, 41 of President Obama's White House staffers now owe the government more than $831,000 in back taxes. ... When asked if they could just keep avoiding taxes, they said, 'Yes, we can! Yes, we can!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government announced today a $60 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, the biggest in our history.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it seems al Qaeda's number two man has released yet another tape where he criticizes the entire Pakistan government, calls them incompetent and corrupt, and demands they be thrown out of office. So, it sounds like they have a Tea Party over there, too. It's a worldwide movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession ended in June of last year. ... So if you're broke and out of a job, this is all in your head! What's the matter with you people?! It was last year!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? ... The...Republican candidate from Delaware, Christine O'Donnell. It turns out she's a practicing witch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if she wins, and goes to the Senate, she'll be the first practicing witch in Washington since Barbara Bush, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for America but not such a great day for Christine O'Donnell.

Sarah Palin tweeted a warning to...O'Donnell. She said, 'The national media is seeking your destruction.' That's ridiculous. If the media wanted to destroy her, they'd just douse her with water. 'I'm melting! I'm melting!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She doesn't just do the witchy stuff. She also said this weekend that Hollywood needs to re-evaluate what they're doing, because movies these days are filled with gay sex and extra-marital affairs. And I'm like, well, have fun in Congress then.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this. Yesterday on 'Meet the Press,' Colin Powell said that President Obama has lost some of his ability to connect with people. When asked for a comment, Obama said, 'Shmeet blarb.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin endorsed a woman named Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary for Delaware Senate. As a result of that endorsement, O'Donnell won that primary. Since then, we've been learning all sorts of wonderful things about her,&quot; and this &quot;weekend, Bill Maher showed some video&quot; in which O'Donnell &quot;admitted that in high school, she dabbled in witchcraft.&quot; Later, O'Donnell &quot;tried to explain this witchcraft thing with, kind of a laugh. 'I was in high school. How many of you didn't hang out with questionable folks in high school? But no, it -- there's been no witchcraft since.' ... I don't know that I've ever heard a politician say, 'There's been no witchcraft since.' Oh, high school -- wedgies and witchcraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tea Party favorite&quot; Christine O'Donnell's recent election &quot;victory has released hell! 'Are Republicans having a battle for the soul of the party?'

That's how he earned the solid gold tan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The premiere of 'Hawaii 5-0'&quot; has been shown &quot;right here on CBS. How many of you saw that show? ... What a great episode. The cops are looking around and they accidentally stumble on Obama's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, according to experts, the recession is over. ... What I want to know is, is it really over or is it pulling a Leno?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about Bob Woodward's new book, 'Obama's Wars.' In the book, he says Joe Biden called Middle East adviser Richard Holbrooke 'the most egotistical bastard I've ever met.' Then, Rahm Emanuel was like, 'What am I, invisible?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woodward's book also reveals that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has severe mood swings. But Karzai was like, 'That is not true!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the media vultures out there are circling around Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell, the way Christine O'Donnell used to circle around anyone with a video camera.

If you're watching, you need to come on this show. If you don't come on this show, I'm going to show a clip every week.' Bill, you cannot do that. It will take time away from Ashton Kutcher discussing credit default swaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, no surprise, Bill O'Reilly is taking the high road. 'I'm trying to be fair to Christine O'Donnell. She's been on this program a number of times, and we have some kind of crazy stuff that she said. We're not going to play it yet. I'm not in the business to injure her.' ... Good for you, sir. Showing her clip is beneath you. But not me. ... 'American scientific companies are crossbreeding humans and animals and coming up with...mice with fully functioning human brains.' ... She's right, folks. How else could Stuart Little have memorized his lines?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is actually starting to lose the support of black voters. It is getting so bad, they said by the time the election rolls around, he might not even vote for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unbelievable. Even Michelle Obama's mom...pulled her aside in the White House and said, 'Girl, you can do better than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last Friday, comedian Stephen Colbert ruined Congress,&quot; when he &quot;mocked our legislators to their faces!&quot; Colbert &quot;went to Washington, walked into a congressional hearing room, and testified on the plight of undocumented farm workers, stealing a job that is traditionally done by baseball players on steroids and not really at all...apologetic CEOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't the only completely humorous C-SPANiard who was offended. 'It's a serious issue. It's broken. And they call in Colbert as the first guy?'

'They've got time to bring a comedian to Washington, DC, but they don't have time to eliminate the uncertainty by extending all of the current tax rates?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former California Governor Jerry Brown, who is running for governor again, denied it was his voice calling his opponent Meg Whitman a 'whore.' Apparently, there was a taped phone conversation, and after Brown hangs up, you hear someone say, 'Why don't we call her a whore?' ... But it's unclear if the voice is Jerry Brown's or someone else's. See, that's where I'm going to miss Governor Schwarzenegger. You always knew it was him. 'Yah, she's a whore.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's safe to assume that Carl Paladino, who's running for governor of New York, is not excited about Coming Out Day being on Columbus Day. Carl Paladino told a group of orthodox Jewish leaders in Brooklyn yesterday that he wants to make sure children aren't brainwashed into believing that homosexual relationships are equally valid, I guess, as heterosexual relationships. And he criticized his opponent, Andrew Cuomo, for marching in a gay pride parade with his daughters. So I guess he's planning to decorate the governor's mansion himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paladino says he's not anti-gay, he just believes people in heterosexual marriages are happier and more successful. So, he's encouraging all gay men to go out and marry a straight woman immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has been busy lately, trying to drum up support for fellow Democrats. Both he and Vice President Biden were at a rally in Philadelphia this weekend,&quot; where &quot;somebody threw a book&quot; at Obama. Bush &quot;got a shoe thrown at him, Obama got a book.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was a political group classified as a 527, meaning that they could receive unlimited corporate donations for their political ads as long as they did not explicitly tell people to vote for a certain candidate and also reported the names of their donors to the IRS. I know what you're thinking. That sounds pretty restrictive. Well, don't worry. The Supreme Court Citizens United ruling fixed this 527 un-loophole, allowing other groups not bound by the ban on pre-election candidate advocacy to feed more fully from the corporate trough. These groups, called 501(c)4's&quot; are &quot;not to be confused with Levi's line of explosive jeans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything in Chile is going well. The last miners are being brought up as we speak. So once all 33 miners have been rescued, that means the only one still stuck in a hole of his own making&quot; will be &quot;President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel Prize for Economics&quot; has been &quot;awarded to three economists. Should we have even given one out this year? ... If there's one thing we've learned in the past few years, it's that there's no such thing as an expert in economics, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration has lifted the six-month ban on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. They can go back to drilling, provided the oil companies follow...new safety regulations. For example, under the new rules, there has to be at least one sober person on the rig at all times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the artist community over here in North Hollywood&quot; is &quot;called NoHo,&quot; which, &quot;ironically, is also Meg Whitman's new campaign slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman has released a new TV ad in both Mandarin and Cantonese. This is part of an effort to reach out to the Asian community. See, that's how&quot; it works in California, &quot;where a white woman from back east trying to replace an Austrian governor runs an ad in Chinese to explain to people why she hired a Mexican maid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea is getting a new evil dictator. ... Kim Jong Il&quot; has &quot;named his own replacement. ... It's his dimwitted son, Kim Jong W. Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;trying to reconnect emotionally with his supporters. I gave up on that years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The midterm elections&quot; are &quot;in three weeks. The Democrats are at a huge disadvantage, and I'll tell you why. They don't have a witch running. That's the problem. They need a witch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the debate with Christine O'Donnell? ... She's trailing in the polls by 20%, so she'll need a miracle to win. Or a really good spell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was moderated by Wolf Blitzer. It got pretty intense. At one point, O'Donnell turned Blitzer into a real wolf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those Chilean miners are finally being rescued. ... President Obama was actually watching some of the rescue effort on TV today. Obama said he just wanted to see how they dig people out of a giant hole in other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting. According to Ancestry.com, Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh are President Obama's tenth cousins, which means Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh are secret Muslims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what to think. One minute, Obama is an illegal immigrant, the next thing you know, he's the lost Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Obama and Palin share family genes. Specifically, mom jeans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President was -- they say he was amused by the revelation. And well, Sarah Palin, I guess now we know why the mainstream media treats her so unfairly. It's because she's black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On CNN tonight,&quot; they &quot;aired...a debate between two Delaware Senate candidates, mostly because Christine O'Donnell is a nut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's not polling very well in Delaware.&quot; O'Donnell is &quot;down 18 points. When given a choice, most Delaware voters said they would rather vote for the lion or the wardrobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had the third and final debate this week between California gubernatorial candidates Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman. In case you missed it, it went something like this. 'Whore.' 'Jerk.' 'Bitch.' 'Old man.' 'Slut.' 'Loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that the Democrats have the momentum going into the midterm election. Of course they do. You always have momentum when you're going downhill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden said Democrats up for election aren't running on their accomplishments, because they're too hard to explain. So basically he's saying either the voters are too stupid to understand or the Democrats are too stupid to explain it. You know what's even harder to explain? Why a Democrat is letting Joe Biden talk with an election just a couple of weeks away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Joe Biden said today President Obama has asked him to run again with him in 2012. So, I think I speak for all late-night hosts -- thank you, Mr. President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in history, there were 100,000 home foreclosures in the month of September: 100,000 people were told this fall they're going to lose the house, 100,001 if you count Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, there is a witch down there in Delaware -- Christine O'Donnell. And they had a television debate last night. And the moderator kept saying, comment about recent Supreme Court decisions. And the only one she could come up with was -- she said, 'Hmm. Cox versus Arquette.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the first debate was at podiums. And the next debate will be at satanic altars, so I think she's going to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know Kim Jong Il, the evil dictator of North Korea. ... He's stepping down, and he has appointed his son Kim Jong Un as his successor. If you don't know, Kim Jong Il has three kids -- Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Nan and then the daughter, Kim Jong Dashian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big night for President Obama. He appeared earlier tonight on the MTV town hall show,&quot; which was on &quot;just before the new episode of...'Jersey Shore.' Yes, nothing says low approval ratings like agreeing to open for Snooki.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But appealing to the young voters is a good idea, because Obama has to find people so young that they're not already disappointed in his performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about the amazing rescue of those miners in Chile. ... Experts thought it would take 48 hours, but it ended up only taking less than 24. That's right. BP was like, 'Pfft! We could have done it in six months.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some big political news. Joe Biden told 'The New York Times' that President Obama has already asked him to be his running mate in 2012. Not only that, he said Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney and the rest of the Republicans also asked him to be Obama's running mate in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a crazy morning on 'The View' this morning. Bill O'Reilly from Fox News was the guest. It ended up with Joy and Whoopi storming off their own show. You'd think people named Joy and Whoopi would be more cheerful, but not the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, down in Delaware, Tea Party darlin', Christine O'Donnell, squared off against Democratic Senate hopeful Chris Coons. Finally a chance to put all that...witchcraft&quot; talk &quot;away and get back to what voters in Delaware really care about. 'Earlier, you said you didn't want to have to talk about comments you made years ago about witchcraft and stuff like that, but in this commercial that's so widely seen, you begin...with the words, 'I am not a witch.' What were you thinking?' 'To put it to rest, to put it behind me.' 'But didn't you realize if you do that in a commercial, it would just revive it and everybody would be talking about that?' Hey, hey! Take it down a notch, white beard. You're a staff and a cloak away from getting tenure at Hogwarts, buddy. Seriously. I mean, Wolf Blitzer. J.K. Rowling wishes she thought of that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, folks, it's sad, but the national media is attacking Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell by digging up embarrassing video clips from her past. Today, they dug one up from all the way back on, last night at 8:00, in her debate against Democratic opponent Chris Coons. ... 'What opinions, of late, that have come from our high court do you most object to?' 'Oh, gosh, um, give me a specific one. I'm sorry.' 'Actually, I can't, because...I need you tell me which ones you object to.' 'Um, I'm very sorry. Right off the top of my head, I know that there are a lot.' Nailed it!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The midterm elections are coming up, two weeks from today. And I have to say, I have never seen a nuttier bunch of candidates. Yesterday, they had a debate for candidates for governor in New York and a new star was born. Jimmy McMillan of the Rent is Too Damn High Party. I think the candidate may be too damn high in that party. I like any candidate who starts a sentence with, 'As a karate expert.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of surprising. President Obama is traveling to India next month and the White House has canceled a planned visit to a Sikh temple...because in order to enter the temple, you have to cover your head. And the White House is worried that photographs of Obama wearing a turban would fuel rumors that he's a Muslim, event though I don't think Muslims wear turbans. But we're dumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same reason he canceled Turban Tuesdays in the Rose Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama really should just do what President Bush used to do. Wherever President Bush went, he had a beer hat on his head. Problem solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
