<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new 'LA Times' poll, in this gubernatorial race in California, Jerry Brown leads Megan Whitman 52%-39%. Well, she spent $163 million of her own money and she's behind by 13 points. That's the biggest expenditure of money for a loss, I guess, since the Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, Halloween, the scariest day of the year, unless you're a Democrat. Then, that would be next Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Less than one week till the election. A new poll shows that one out of three people haven't decided who they're going to vote for yet. And you know, for most people, it's a tough choice. I mean, do you vote for the people who got us into this mess or for the people who can't get us out of this mess?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama campaigning like crazy. He's out on the road. He held a big political fundraiser in Rhode Island the other day. He left early. He told the audience he had to go home to 'walk the dog and scoop the poop.' ... Scoop the poop is...not a job for the President. Where's Joe Biden? Isn't that his job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs There's Trouble In The Democratic Party:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Obama's slogan, 'Yes We Can,' changed to 'Thought We Could.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Joe Biden asked to see the President's birth certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Only running campaign commercials in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Their top adviser ? the Rent Is Too Damn High guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. They got a 'hang in there' text from Brett Favre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Gave up on campaigning to go see 'Jackass 3-D.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Replaced old playbook with 'They Call Me Baba Booey' by Gary Dell'Abate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Only cheered up by Barney Frank's hilarious Buddy Hackett impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nancy Pelosi found in hotel room drunk and naked with Charlie Sheen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even Fox News feels sorry for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who turned 63 today. ... Bill put flower petals on the bed at a cozy bed and breakfast for a romantic getaway. Then he called Hillary to say happy birthday, which is nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Tuesday night, and another celebrity dancer has been fired from 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... Miraculously, Bristol Palin was not eliminated or impregnated. That makes it a six-week streak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know where she's getting all the support. Somehow, Bristol Palin has gotten more votes than her mother did in the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe she'll get eliminated next week. Better be soon. Mid-November is typically when the Palin family goes into hibernation. She needs to spend the next six weeks gorging on salmon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight,&quot; the guest is &quot;Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman. He was actually appointed to serve out Vice President Joe Biden's term and has spent that time as an outspoken advocate for the people, working tirelessly to break up the big banks. So naturally, he's completely fed up and quitting after less than two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joy Behar says Sharron Angle is going to hell. Funny, I didn't know Angle was going on 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, we are just four days away from my and that other guy's rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC. ... And if you have not booked your plane ticket yet, get walking and bring a tent, because the hotels are booked. And, unfortunately, the Democrats' offices won't be vacant until next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the midterm elections are next week, and we're finally going to take our country back, from the people who stole it, by being elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Less than a week until the election. ... I was thinking about that. You know, it's a shame that either of these parties has to win, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama left a big political fundraising event in Rhode Island yesterday. He left early. ... He told the audience he had to go home to 'walk the dog and scoop the poop.' You know what that means? His dog has created more shovel ready jobs than he has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Congressman Charlie Rangel has dumped his legal team and will represent himself at his upcoming ethics trial. Is that a good idea? I mean, he's a politician and a lawyer. He puts his hand on a Bible, it could explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another threatening audio message from Osama bin Laden. This time he's threatening the French. Bin Laden is angry that Muslim women in France cannot wear their burqas in public. You know bin Laden. If there's one thing he can't stand, it's somebody denying women their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the psychic octopus in Germany that would go game to game and pick&quot; the World Cup soccer &quot;winners, the psychic octopus? ... He's dead. ... He was stomped to death outside a rand Paul Rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington, DC, was under a tornado watch today. It was pretty crazy, especially when the White House landed on Christine O'Donnell, and her feet curled up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I look at the Democrats' chances in the midterms. I assume, under an electron microscope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the homestretch, ladies and gentlemen. The midterm elections are next Tuesday, whereas I've been telling my Democratic friends, next Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Emotions are running high, folks. You can feel the excitement pounding in your heart. Or, if you're a liberal activist at a Rand Paul rally, pounding on your head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me explain. It seems Lauren Valle, a 115-pound female MoveOn.org activist, got her cranium dangerously close to Rand Paul outside a Kentucky debate. But luckily, two men had the courage to throw her to the ground and hold her down while a third hero stomped on her melon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, while liberals' faces are getting stepped on in Kentucky, everywhere else, it's their hopes and dreams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Democrats can brag that they stood against Obama on the most important vote of all, like Mississippi Democrat Gene Taylor, who last weekend proudly announced that he voted for John McCain. That is brave. If only more people in his district had followed his lead, they probably wouldn't be represented by a gutless Democrat like Gene Taylor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am glad the Democrats are finally showing some spine, a spine that can best be seen as they run away from their record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, Laura Bush says now that George Bush is out of the White House, he should pick up his dirty socks and towels. Basically, he is doing the same thing he did as President -- making a huge mess and expecting somebody else to clean it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 'Entertainment Tonight,' Sarah Palin says she may run for president in 2012 if there's nobody else to do it. Today, a poll came out showing that voters prefer nobody else to do it over Sarah Palin, two to one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure I understand this. NASA has received initial funding for a long-term manned mission sending astronauts to Mars. We'll send the astronauts to Mars and then leave them there. They stay there. We won't be able to bring them back. They would fly to Mars and we leave them there. Don't we finish anything in this country? 'Oh, we got you there! That's good enough!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Halloween? .. Oh, it's the scariest day of the year, if you don't count Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday is Election Day. Millions and millions of Americans take time off from their jobs on Tuesday to pretend to go vote, so it's going to be a big day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you found this to be true, that there is a lot of confusion about the election? For example, that Delaware witch who is running for Senate -- Christine O'Donnell, -- she thinks that the Jon Stewart Rally To Restore Sanity is actually a Rally to Restore Satan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the San Francisco Giants,&quot; who won the &quot;first game&quot; of the World Series. The &quot;Rangers lost and that Cliff Lee, man, this guy got beat up pretty bad. It was like watching a Rand Paul rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a campaign stop in New York this week, Joe Biden said to a volunteer, 'If I had your hair, I would have been president.' In response, the guy was like, 'If I had your hair, I wouldn't bring up the subject of hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Esquire' magazine ranked President Obama one of the world's best-dressed politicians, while North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il was ranked best dressed female janitor who also happens to be a politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A court just ruled that voters in Arizona don't need to show proof of citizenship at the polls next week. When asked about the ruling, some said they were 'on the fence,' while many said they 'just hopped over it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other scary Halloween news, tonight on 'ET,' Sarah Palin sat down with Mary Hart. 'Are you going to run for president?' 'You know, I've not decided what I'm going to do in 2012.' ... Great. One quick question. Why are you announcing this to Mary Hart? Billy Bush wasn't available? Couldn't get Mario Lopez on the phone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next Tuesday's election is an important one. It's not just about selecting the candidate who may or may not best represent your political values. It's about choosing between hard-line Marxist state tyranny and autocratic Taliban religious crazies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll came out that says that most Americans think President Obama is underperforming. ... Obama admits that the economy is in rough shape, but says the Republicans have just been sitting around watching and drinking Slurpees. That explains why the Republicans are crazy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's a great way to scare Californians this Halloween -- remind them our choice for governor is Meg Whitman or Jerry Brown.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal investigators have stopped a man named Farooq Ahmed...from&quot; carrying out a &quot;terrorist plot against the DC Metro system.&quot; He had &quot;planned to bring Washington, DC, to a standstill. Hey, you're a little late. ... After two years of Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, we're already there, alright. Mission accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another terrorist threat today. Apparently, a toner cartridge that had been suspiciously modified was discovered aboard a UPS cargo flight. You know, that's the last time I order my toner cartridges from the Office Depot in Yemen. ... I mean, you save a few bucks, but it's nothing but problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess President Obama was notified about this last night at 10:30. He was notified about the threat. And Homeland Security said, 'This had the potential to be almost as bad for the White House as Tuesday's midterm election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. If we find a package that contains one of these bombs, and especially if it's a UPS package, why announce it on the news? Just stamp return to sender. Put it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove said this week that Sarah Palin does not have the 'gravitas' to be president of the United States. Sarah Palin is furious. She says as soon as she finds out what 'gravitas' means, she will respond, and harshly!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just can't get through Halloween fast enough. ... They got the lousy games that you've got to play. And I always hated the bobbing for apples. ... Or as Dick Cheney used to call it, 'apple-boarding.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sobering thought -- on this very day in 1929, the stock market crashed. And you know why it crashed? Wall Street greed. ... Thank God they fixed that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you folks know about this WikiLeaks deal? ... Somehow they get secret government military papers from the CIA, from the state department,&quot; and &quot;from the Pentagon,&quot; and &quot;then they release them on WikiLeaks. And everybody goes crazy because they're secret, and they think, 'Oh, what do we do now?' I'll give you an example of the kind of stuff they're releasing. It turns out now, the CIA...knew about Leno getting a show at 10:00. ... And they did nothing to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you all had a nice Halloween. ... How many of you are sick today from too much candy? How many are sick from too many political ads?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many think the Democrats will keep the House? How many are too busy worried about trying to keep their own house?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the good news -- the President was campaigning to enthusiastic crowds wherever he went. People were cheering and applauding. The bad news -- the President that was campaigning was Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I like down there in Kentucky is that Rand Paul. ... Here's a guy that...likes having rallies and then he likes having people stomped on. So if you show up at a rally, be prepared to get stomped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Rand Paul goons saw a woman with a sign that they didn't like as he was driving by in his motorcade. So they wrestled her to the ground, because she&quot; was &quot;carrying what appeared to be a dangerous sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they get her down on the ground, and then the guy who did the stomping...said, 'I can't ? I've got a bad back. I couldn't bend over, so I had to use my foot to keep her head on the ground.' Oh, okay. Well, once you know the facts, everything's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, there were bomb packages from Yemen sent by the same guy...who did the work&quot; for the &quot;guy who had the underpants bomb? ... This guy has made more bombs than Kevin Costner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is Election Day. Some interesting news -- the final poll before the election shows that 55% of Americans plan to vote for Republicans, while 40% plan to vote for Democrats. ... I guess Obama is finally going to get that change he was talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems most experts are predicting that Republicans will win back the House tomorrow. ... When Americans heard that, they were like, 'Wait, we can win back our houses?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama sent out an email encouraging his supporters to take at least three friends with them to vote. That's not how people vote. That's how women go to the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DNC released a last-minute ad that says, 'Don't let Sarah Palin win. Vote tomorrow.' The weird part is, it ends with the line, 'I'm John McCain and I approve this message.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California will vote on Prop 19 tomorrow to...legalize marijuana,&quot; which &quot;means thousands of stoners will be at the polls, going, 'Dude, just pass it. Just pass it! Thanks. Now let's vote on Prop 19.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very special night tonight on 'Dancing with the Stars.' It was their 200th show. ... It's more important to vote for your favorite dancing star than it is to vote for anyone or anything in these so-called elections tomorrow, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midterm elections are tomorrow. President Obama was out making last-minute appeal to voters. He told them, 'Don't look at the polls, don't look at the cable news prognosticators, in fact, don't even look at the ballot, just mark the dots in at random and we'll have a better shot at winning that way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In just a few hours, voting will start at the biggest election in this country since two years ago, with both sides campaigning furiously to get their base to the polls. Republicans, you're up. Of course, they've been decrying the lack of bipartisanship in Washington, which they apparently will decry right up until they retake control of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Democrats are striking back with their most powerful weapon -- total delusion. 'I believe that we'll hold on to both houses.' 'Yes, I believe that Democrats are going to hold on to the House.' 'If it's a Republican tidal wave, I've sensed a Democratic undertow going against it.' 'There's a blue thunder that's going to stop the red wave.' Well that's your problem right there. If you want to stop a red wave, you don't use blue thunder, you use some sort of blue seawall, or a blue retaining area. Thunder's only good if you're trying to scare dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How bad has it gotten for the Democrats? They had to send in former President Bill Clinton to campaign against other Democrats. 'Bill Clinton tried to persuade Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek to drop out of running in the three-way race for the Florida Senate seat.' .. Why is Clinton backing lifelong Republican Charlie Crist over the Democrat? 'Clinton and a top aide thought they had convinced Meek to drop out, thus delivering liberals and moderates to Independent Charlie Crist and preventing Republican Marco Rubio from winning.' Ah! Rather than vote for the guy who would agree with them on most things, they'll settle for the guy who has never really agreed with them on anything to keep out the guy who won't talk to them. That's from Sun-Szu's 'The Art Of War...The F@*k Are You Doing?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is that time of year, when people dress up and hide who they really are. That's right. Tomorrow's Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the Obamas welcomed trick-or-treaters to the White House. One kid refused to be photographed with the President, because he's running for student council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is All Saints Day. Tomorrow is Day of the Dead. And Wednesday's Day of the Dead Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is likely that tomorrow, Barack Obama is going to lose the House. So then he'll know how a lot of other Americans feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, former President Clinton was campaigning for an Ohio congressman when the dude's wife suddenly went into labor. Out of habit, Bill Clinton said, 'That's not mine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new election is going to lead to a huge disaster -- Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to acting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was Election Day in America today. ... The Republicans...didn't win the Senate. They did win the House, which means the Democrats lost the House. Big deal. A lot of Americans lost their house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'Indecision 2010,'&quot; a &quot;Tea Party-ganza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is incredible. Many of the results are in. The GOP is now projected to take 692 seats from the Democrats, out of a possible -- well, there were 100 that were up for grabs. But somehow they have managed...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually they're projected now to take 60 seats and retake the House of Representatives. The Democrats are projected to keep the Senate. We're going to get to some results here.&quot; In Connecticut, the &quot;state that your train goes through when you're trying to reach a real city, Democrat Richard Blumenthal has defeated Republican Linda McMahon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina Senate race ? this is very interesting. Obviously, South Carolina the fourth best Carolina, out of North Carolina and then two that don't exist and then South Carolina. Jim DeMint has defeated Alvin Greene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many residents, of course, in Florida voted early and obviously then went right to eat dinner. ... Marco Rubio has defeated Charlie Crist&quot; and Democrat Kendrick Meek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, as always&quot; with &quot;pre-election coverage,&quot; there was a &quot;lot of predicting. This year's prognostications very greatly&quot; depended &quot;on whether the person predicting...was a Democrat or anybody else in the world other than a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York,&quot; Carl Paladino's &quot;campaign to not be elected governor has succeeded. Andrew Cuomo is the victor. Paladino, of course, tried very hard not to be governor. He must be feeling very pleased tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Wisconsin,&quot; Russ Feingold &quot;defeated for having progressive values. In Louisiana, David Vitter has absolutely destroyed his challenger by going out with hookers. All right. ... So really, what is the message we're sending to America tonight? It is better to, I think, go see prostitutes than...believe Social Security is a right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we will be riding a...GOP barrel all the way to Tax Cut Beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today as Americans, we got to see democracy in action. I hope that we've all exercised our fundamental right by voting Bristol Palin off 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, today is Election Day. I hope everyone voted...because I did. I am very interested in the democratic process. Also, Latinos love free stickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were so many propositions in California this year, it was confusing. I saw one billboard that said, 'Vote No on Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was on Ryan Seacrest's radio show this morning, urging young people to vote. He was the fifth caller, so he got two tickets to see Usher on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also put out a video today on AOL.&quot; It is &quot;great that he's reaching out to old people, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama did not call&quot; the San Francisco Giants &quot;to congratulate them&quot; on winning this year's World Series. But Obama &quot;did call the Texas Rangers after the World Series and said, 'You guys can still pull this thing out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surprisingly, a lot of people in the Tea Party movement are in favor of the legalization of marijuana. ... That explains all the crazy stuff they said this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some medical marijuana dispensaries in California are selling a very potent strain of pot that's called 'Mel Gibson.' ... I thought weed was supposed to mellow you out. That's like naming virgin olive oil after Snooki.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do the Democrats have in common with Charlie Sheen? They both woke up this morning going, 'What happened late night?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; they had the &quot;mid-term elections, unless you're the Democrats. Then it was the end-term elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Republicans won by a mudslide. ... To give you an idea of how bad it was, today, President Obama changed his slogan from 'Yes we can' to 'I've fallen and I can't get up.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, all year long, the Democrats have been telling people to get out the vote. And yesterday, people told the Democrats, 'We voted, now get out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that...Republicans have gained control of the House, John Boehner is going to replace Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. So we've gone from the 'Botoxer' to the 'Bronzer.' I'm not sure that's really improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact,&quot; Boehner's &quot;new slogan ? 'Yes we tan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how the different TV news networks covered the election last night. Like, on MSNBC it was called 'Election Night 2010: What Went Wrong.' At Fox, it was 'Election Night 2010: Party, party, party!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And despite being caught paying $300 for a prostitute, Senator David Vitter easily won reelection. See, this proves that voters respect a fiscal conservative like Vitter, who only spends $300 on his hooker, as opposed to a wild-spending liberal like Eliot Spitzer, who spent $5,000 on his hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it wasn't all good news for...Republicans&quot; as &quot;pro-witchcraft candidate&quot; Christine O'Donnell &quot;lost by a big margin. At least now she can tell people she dabbled in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here in California, Meg Whitman...spent $160 million of her own money on her campaign and lost, to which the Yankees said, 'Hey, join the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Jerry Brown, the new old governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can sure tell it's winter. The Democrats have gone into hibernation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you were applauding, three more states turned red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Washington, DC, today,&quot; volunteers &quot;were washing the mud off Democrats and releasing them back into the wild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are in charge now, ladies and gentlemen. And we all remember how well that worked last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters didn't like the way President Obama was handling the economy. Wait a minute, he was handling the economy? What?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, Ohio Representative John Boehner succeeds Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House. He will be our first orange Speaker of the House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, down in Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, the witch, she lost the election. She conceded, congratulated her opponent, and then vanished in a cloud of smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying that Christine O'Donnell's career in politics may be over. I think, however, she still has about six months left as a punch line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rand Paul? Guy was elected, and wasting no time, went right to Washington and started stomping Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did everyone watch the election results last night? Oh, man, it was a terrible night for Democrats in Congress, but a terrific night for moving companies in the Washington, DC, area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was really emotional watching the results on TV. I don't know what was more touching -- John Boehner starting to cry or Nancy Pelosi trying to cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people went on Twitter to complain that the font size used on ballots was too small. ... People who got the small fonts were like, 'I can't see anyone I want to vote for!' People who got the regular size fonts were like, 'I can't see anyone I want to vote for!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election day is...over. ... Some pundits are saying that the Republican gains actually might be good for President Obama. because instead of just saying no, they'll actually have to do things. And their top two priorities are cutting taxes and reducing the debt, which is kind of like your top two priorities in life being to lose weight and win the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. So, we'll see what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sean Duffy, who was on 'The Real World Boston,'&quot; ran in &quot;Wisconsin and...actually won his race,&quot; which &quot;hopefully bodes well for a certain President Snooki in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, last night&quot; they had the &quot;midterm elections. ... Big night for the Republicans. They decisively took back the House of Representatives ? 239 seats to the Democrats' 185, with 11 still to be decided -- increased their margin of control of the Senate from 41 seats out of a hundred to 47 seats out of a hundred, with one race still in question. Now some would argue, 'They don't have control of the Senate. That's less than 50. Don't the Democrats still control the Senate?' The people that would argue that just have no idea how fu@3ed up the Senate really is. It is a silly and ridiculous place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I recap the results of least nights mid-term elections. Parents, if you have Democrats, you might want to have them leave the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats lost badly in the election yesterday. Fortunately for President Obama, his healthcare plan covers a@#-kicking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new Speaker of the House. His name is John Boehner. He said Republicans will work for all Americans -- white American people and very white people, and the albinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President called Boehner to congratulate him. Then he went upstairs to the Oval Office to update his resume on Monster.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, Meg Whitman spent $140 million of her own money to be governor and still lost! ... To get back some of her money that she lost, she put her housekeeper up on eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meg Whitman blew $140 million in one year. She definitely has a future as a rapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday night, voters completely rejected the efforts of a charismatic African American who was only trying to do the best job he could. Rick Fox is off 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday not good for President Obama either. ... People just gave up hope, went for the change.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Present Obama lost 66 Democrats. And not one of them was Joe Biden. ... How frustrating is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican John Boehner will take over as Speaker of the House from Nancy Pelosi. Let me tell you something. That's not going to be easy. Those are mighty big eyes to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Federal government announced that it will pump an additional $600 billion into the economy. I guess they feel they have to make up for what Meg Whitman isn't spending anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, Meg Whitman lost to Jerry Brown, despite spending $141 million of her own money. See, that prove she's not cut out to be a professional politician. You don't spend your own money. You spend other people's money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the big Republican landslide, ladies and gentlemen? ... I tell you, nobody's laughing at my John Boehner tattoo now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama's press conference the day after Election Day? .. He looked a little sad, a little disappointed. I mean, it was like last night's audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's the thing about the President. I mean, one day you're up, one day you're down. But you got to keep...doing the job. In fact, this weekend,&quot; Obama is &quot;going to India on business. He will be traveling on Air Force One Term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's future now depends on Republicans and Democrats working together. ... We're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush&quot; has written a &quot;book...called 'Decision Points'. And it will be out next week. ... I've already made a decision not to buy it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new book, George W. Bush reveals that he considered dropping Dick Cheney from the 2004 ticket, because he wanted to demonstrate that he was in charge, not Cheney. But then Cheney nixed the idea, so they went back to normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 'The Today Show,' Bush said that his new book will be a 'data point for future historians.' Then he said, 'That's kind of a mind bender. Future historians. They should just call them 'nows.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, everyone is still talking about the unemployment rate. ... This week, it went up about 65 Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a grand tradition in the great country of ours. Each quadrennial presidential contest shall be followed biennially by a thorough and robust congressional referendum. And in such instance whereupon the President's party receives unto a whooping of a@s, the President shall then in due haste present forth an obligatory post-electoral, red-carpeted, impodiumed walk of shame. So it is written, so say we all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;could have done a whole ton of jokes, like, uh, 'White presidents take a midterm electoral defeat like this: 'I can't believe you rebuked my policy.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, we turn the clocks back. Now, don't confuse that with last Tuesday, when Democrats got their clocks cleaned.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it was a rough day for incumbents. But some of them held onto their jobs. Barney Frank reelected in Massachusetts. John McCain reelected in Arizona. So Congress still has Barney and the dinosaur. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like John Boehner will be the new Speaker of the House. He is the son of a bartender, one of 12 children. He grew up in a two-room home with just one bathroom, worked his way through school, became the first person in his family to graduate from college, and, sadly, fell in with the wrong crowd and wound up in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Boehner is, right? He's that orange-looking guy. See, Republicans -- that counts as diversity. ... In the Republican Party, he is a man of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston said in an interview that Sarah Palin is not qualified to be president. And, believe me, if there's anyone who knows about not being qualified for something it is Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those elections? We have a Republican House, we have a Democratic Senate, and we have a president with veto power. Smooth sailing, right? No problems there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one kind of awkward moment. When he met the president of India,&quot; Obama &quot;asked him, 'What do you think? Windows Vista or should I upgrade to Windows 7?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi, who lost her position as Speaker of the House, says she will seek to become the House Minority Leader.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC news anchor Keith Olbermann will be back to work on Wednesday, after being suspended without pay for giving campaign contributions to Democratic candidates, which is against the rules at MSNBC.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love fall in New York City? ... The colors, you know, brown and gold and orange. And that's just John Boehner's face.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush has written his memoir. It's called 'Decision Points.' I've already decided not to read it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll be everywhere promoting the book. He's...going to be on the 'Today Show,' going to be on the Oprah Winfrey show, and tomorrow he'll be on the Rachel Ray Show, waterboarding veal cutlets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the book, George Bush claims that he's happy to be out of Washington. Well, that makes it unanimous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you thinking about buying the George W. Bush book? It's a big, thick book and it -- when are you in the bookstore, you can&quot; use it &quot;stand on&quot; and &quot;get a better book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is on the big book tour this week. During an interview with 'USA Today,' Bush said that he was 'blindsided by the financial crisis.' Bush said he was also blindsided by the fact that he knew the word blindsided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his trip to India yesterday, President Obama said that he has to make some mid-course corrections if he wants to win over frustrated Americans. ... And then people in India were like, 'You think you have to deal with frustrated Americans. Please! 'Did you unplug it, sir? Did you unplug it?' 'Of course I unplugged it. What the heck do you think I did?' 'I'm trying to help you, sir. Did you unplug it?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the great thing about America -- we all have the freedom to have our own opinions and say and do what we wish. 'MSNBC has suspended Keith Olbermann for making political donations.' Almost everybody has that right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Olbermann broke an MSNBC rule by making campaign donations without first obtaining permission from the network. Because MSNBC has a hard and fast rule that political donations represent bias in journalism, unless you ask first. 'You learn your manners, boy, or I'll knock you down to hosting 'Headliners &amp; Legends' so fast, your head'll spin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; there is &quot;no telling how long it will be until we see Keith Olbermann again. 'MSNBC says...Olbermann will be back on the air tomorrow night.' Lesson learned. Yes, MSNBC ? it's a stupid rule, but at least it was enforced poorly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in India yesterday, visiting our jobs. Tomorrow he goes to China, to visit our money. So it's a nice trip.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the Republicans are making such a big deal out of it, saying how expensive the trip was. They said the President was staying at the Taj Mahal. He was not staying at the Taj Mahal. Turns out he was staying at the Taj Mahal Express, near the airport. Smaller...hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama traveled to India because he said it's becoming one of our most important trading partners. For example, we give them our American jobs, and they give us -- what the hell? Do we get anything out of this? Have we gotten anything out of this? No! We don't get anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama is traveling. He went to India, then I believe South Korea, then Japan. He's going to keep traveling until he finds his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's memoir is out today. And the guy is apparently quite candid, quite honest in the memoir. It's a big, big book. The problem is because of his economic policies, nobody can afford to buy the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the guy, the President, he is still quick, still very athletic. ... He proved today at a book signing that he can still duck a shoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the book, Bush says that he lost respect for John McCain when he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate.&quot; This is coming from a &quot;guy whose running mate shot a buddy in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news today from President Obama. You know how he's been trying for two years to shut down Guantanamo Bay.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that welfare recipients can no longer use state-issued debit cards at medical marijuana shops. He says, 'This is a chronic waste of money and a waste of chronic money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the California high-speed rail authority has voted to spend $4.3 billion to build rail line for either Merced to Fresno or Bakersfield to Fresno.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy in Indonesia wrote this book about president Obama. Did you hear about this? It's 5,472 pages long, the thickest book in the world. The book is called, 'One of Obama's Speeches.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China is expected to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, 'That hasn't happened already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the power went out, the food on the&quot; Carnival cruise ship &quot;spoiled. And the Navy had to send food.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said on '60 Minutes' last Sunday he wants to bring back the eight million jobs we have lost. And today, India said, 'Uh, no.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's Asian tour&quot; has &quot;not been too successful. At the economic summit in South Korea, President Obama said, 'Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.' ... I know Obama's a big fan of the Chicago White Sox, but he sounds more like a Cubs fan right about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one awkward moment when President Obama went to pay for lunch, the Chinese President Hu Jintao said, 'Your money is no good here.' And President Obama thought the Chinese leader was just being polite, but he said, 'No, your money really sucks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's overseas trip has been such a disaster that people in Kenya are now claiming he has an American birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in China, workers...built a 15-story hotel in just six days. And kids stay free, because, you know, they're the ones that built it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the US Postal service announced today they lost $8.5 billion this year. They say they blame it on people using e-mail. Oh, and the fact that terrorists have switched to UPS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday night...is the debut of the Sarah Palin show. ... it's called 'Sarah Palin's Alaska.' And Sarah Palin takes you all around Alaska&quot; on the program. For example, she &quot;will show you where she waterboarded Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody said to me, 'Did you hear that they are running on the Discovery Channel, or one of those things, the show with Sarah Palin?' And I said, 'What happened? Did we run out of Kardashians?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no, seriously. In all truthfulness, it's nice to see Sarah Palin finally getting some media attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's on the Sarah Palin show? John McCain makes an appearance. He wasn't scheduled, he just wandered through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the name of the Sarah Palin show is 'Bleep My Ex-Governor Says.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush has a new memoir out and he was talking in an interview and he said that he thought that Sarah Palin was not qualified to be president. Well, isn't that the pot calling kettle black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, when does not being qualified to be president disqualify you from being president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush says now that he hardly ever leaves Texas. Former President Bush says he hardly ever leaves Texas. Hell, when he was president he hardly ever left Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton met with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for six hours at a hotel yesterday. When Hillary saw that she had a six-hour meeting at a hotel, she was like, 'Wait, I think this is Bill's schedule.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Bill Clinton, today he released a statement where he called George W. Bush's new memoir 'well-written and interesting.' Then Bush released a statement calling Clinton's lie 'convincing and much appreciated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is back home after his ten-day trip to Asia. On the way back yesterday, Air Force One made a stop in Anchorage, Alaska, which is hopefully the only time we'll hear Air Force One and Anchorage, Alaska, in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Charlie Rangel walked out of his ethics hearing today after being refused an extension. He said he didn't have any money for legal representation. ... What about all the money you saved not paying any taxes? Use that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...has her own weekly show now. Anybody ever been to Alaska? I always...wanted to go to Alaska. I don't think that's going to happen now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's ten-day, post-election Asian sojourn has ended. It was a trip filled with high-level political intrigue, pomp, circumstance, and the kind of citizen of the world theatrics that have so endeared the President to his critics. 'Indonesia is a part of me. I am back home.' Don't believe him, Indonesia! Ask for his Indonesian birth certificate! He's actually from Hawaii! He's tricking you! It's what he does to become president of your land!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I can't wait to hear about his trip. I bet he thinks he hit a home run. 'Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles. But they're really important singles.' At least he's...not using cricket references.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'President Obama's Asia trip was a total disaster. 'His economic view somewhat rejected.' 'No resolution with China over their currency valuation.' 'He failed to reach a free trade agreement with South Korea.' 'No cooling of tensions between India and Pakistan.' .... ' This is a troubled time in America. Why is he going on this long trip?' 'This was an extraordinarily expensive trip.' 'Another chapter in the great American apology tour.' 'What did he get besides really nice photo ops?' ... I haven't seen a trip reviewed this badly since the Griswolds went to Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow. Barack Obama is just terrible. Republicans especially are coming down on him mercilessly. I bet they miss the good old days when they had a president they respected. 'Under Clinton, you had a president who was willing to compromise.' 'Bill Clinton, who you depict in your book ? he was a flexible guy.' 'Yes.' 'He learned how to compromise with conservatives to get things done.' 'If he's willing to work with us, as Bill Clinton did after the 1994 elections to pass things like welfare reform, trade agreements and the like, we'll certainly work with him.' That's right. Republican darling Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of you may be too young to remember the feel-good 1990s, when a universally respected President Clinton reigned over an eight-year bipartisan love-fest. Let me give you a taste of what it felt like back then. 'Let the sun shine, let the sun shine' -- and by the way, that is what they were singing at his impeachment hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, that's how I remember it. Oh, but I was high for nearly the entire decade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess for Republicans, Clinton is like a fine wine -- the more you drink, the harder it is to remember, 'Oh, I...hate wine!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton apparently has a cameo in the new 'Hangover 2' movie. When asked why Clinton is in the movie, the producer said, 'There are some things Mike Tyson will not do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sunday night was the debut of the reality show 'Sarah Palin's Alaska.' Hey, say what you want. It got huge ratings. Even -- even John McCain watched it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Halfway through the program McCain turned to his wife Cindy and said, 'Who is that woman? She looks familiar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wife of a Maryland politician is suspected of taking bribes was found with $80,000 in cash hidden in her bra. How big is that bra? $80,000? Is that a good place to hide it? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No guy would ever think to look there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House ethics committee has found Congressman Charles Rangel guilty of financial misconduct. You got to understand. Hey. Hey, you know, it wasn't easy. They had to go way outside Washington to find anyone who knew anything about ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't think Rangel gets it. Like, today, he said to pay his fine he's going to have to accept bribes now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has just released a new children's book. It just came out. Have you seen this? It's called -- right here. It's called 'Of Thee I Sing.' 'Of Thee I Sing.' And of course, the Republicans, you know, they couldn't wait to release their version of the book: 'The End I See.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Michael Vick? He set a record last night, 59 points against the Washington Redskins. Yeah, that was unbelievable. The most points ever on a Monday Night Football game. Hasn't been an ass kicking in Washington since I guess the midterm election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in Thailand, former President Bill Clinton shot a cameo for the movie 'The Hangover 2.' ... When asked what he was doing in Thailand, Bill Clinton got very quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Oxford Dictionary has declared Sarah Palin's made-up word 'refudiate' to be the 2009 word of the year. Yeah, that's true. Palin was honored. Said she'll continue to do our best to dismangle the English language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the groundbreaking ceremony of the George W. Bush's presidential library in Dallas. ... It's easy to get into the building, but then you spend ten years trying to find an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney attended the ceremony. It's fitting for Cheney to be at the library. He spent eight years telling Bush to be quiet, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When speaking about Bush, Dick Cheney said that Americans can tell a decent, good-hearted guy when they see him. Then he was like, 'Let me know if you do. I need that heart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a memo today from NBC. It says, since we have former President Bush on the show tonight, we need to maintain a higher standard of dignity during our broadcast, you see. No cheap or tasteless jokes, nothing crass, nothing juvenile. So good night, everybody. That's all we have for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many have flown since they instituted these new security procedures? Because you know, under these new rules, they can touch your breasts, they can touch your genitals, in some circumstances they can put -- put their hands down your pants. See, in the airport, that's a security check. In Hollywood, that would be an audition.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tempers are starting to flare at the airport. Today I saw one of those bomb-sniffing dogs said to another bomb-sniffing dog, 'Hey you lick my junk, I'll have you arrested.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A study has found that the collective wealth of Congress has increased 16% since the financial meltdown. Now over half the members of Congress are millionaires. Yeah, that explains why they haven't done anything about the recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats in the House have chosen Nancy Pelosi to stay on as their leader. She is the new House Minority Leader. Why -- why -- why mess with success, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller announced he wants the FCC to take both MSNBC and Fox News off the air, because he says they're both biased. He wants them both off the air. When asked about CNN, he said 'CNN? That's still on the air?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the opening of the George W. Bush presidential center in Texas, Dick Cheney joked that the center is the only shovel-ready project in America. Yeah. Well, I don't know about that. Dick Cheney taking a buddy hunting? That could be another shovel-ready project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an upcoming interview with Barbara Walters, Sarah Palin says she believes she can beat Obama in 2012. The way things are going right now, Bristol Palin could beat Obama in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how confident Sarah Palin is. She's already started writing her inaugural address on her hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plans are now under way for a remake of the movie, 'Total Recall.' This one's a little different. It stars Congressman Charlie Rangel saying, 'I don't recall, I don't recall, I don't recall, I don't recall.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amazon.com announced they will hire over 15,000 temporary employees this holiday season. Most of them Democrats who were just voted out of office, but that's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A California district attorney has vowed to prosecute any TSA agent who touches a passenger inappropriately. Yeah, the DA says, there's a time and a place for inappropriately touching a Californian. It's called an audition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump wants to see if people want to see him run for president. So a Website has been launched called, 'Shouldtrumprun.com.' Yeah, the American public has respond with a Website by the name of 'No.com.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressional House Democrats have been pushing for $12 billion more for unemployment benefits. They say we must not turn our backs on those who until two weeks ago were House Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston has announced that he's not going to do any more interviews for a while. Yeah, when asked why, he said, 'Because I've already used all the words I know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the airport, &quot;They'll have either the complete body search where you're groped, or they'll put you through the naked body scan, airport security. And I'm saying to myself well wait a minute, why can't we have both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm all for it because if there's a guy walking around with a bomb, I want to know about that. So I don't mind the excessive, you know, the groping and the probing. My problem is when it's done, I don't know how much to tip the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They opened the George W. Bush presidential library out there in Dallas. They broke the ground already out there on Monday. I know you're snickering already. The guy never read a book in his life but he's got a library. How does that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush opening an library, that's like Kirsty Ally opening a can of Diet Coke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin says she's going to run for president in 2012. Donald Trump said he's going to run for president in 2012 against Sarah Palin. Nice to know there will somebody equally unqualified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that would be some presidential race. You've got Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. The debates, get there early and get some seats down in the front for those debates. You're fired, you betcha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are going to be problems when Donald Trump runs. They had a lot of problems with Obama, you wait until Donald Trump runs because the rumor is already that thing on his head, the rumor now is that thing on his head was not born in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is still trying to quit cigarettes two years into his Administration. President Clinton kept cigars in his office. But I don't smoke. During the Bush Administration, visitors to the Oval Office said it smelled like smoke. That's because Dick Cheney installed a dimensional portal to hell. It's a quick way to get home!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama had a tough decision to make this week. Which turkey does he pardon? The Thanksgiving one or Charlie Rangel? I mean, which one do you go with?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congressman Charles Rangel found guilty on 11 charges. And Democratic leaders say Rangel 'undermined trust in Congress.' Really? Trust in Congress? Huh, really? Who has any trust in Congress? Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess what happened was everybody ran to the secure underground bunker, but they couldn't get in because Dick Cheney changed all the locks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, the TSA is saying they will allow pilots to pass through security a lot easier than before. See, I don't think you have to pat down the pilot, right? You don't have to have them go through the body scanner. You know, I'm happy the pilot just passes the breathalyzer. That's all I care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama expected to announce this week a plan to put 5,000 salad bars in to public schools. ... They expect as many as three students to use this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Switzerland say for the first time, they have isolated atoms of antimatter, which could help solve some the biggest mysteries in the universe. For example, this could explain how Bristol Palin is still on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bristol Palin...gets more votes than anyone else. You know what this means? John McCain picked the wrong Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In her new book, Sarah Palin criticizes 'American Idol,' saying the show is full of talent-deprived contestants, you know, unlike 'Dancing with the Stars.' Those people have real...but that other show, that's nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush&quot; has &quot;published his memoirs. ... President Bush was asked today if he used a ghost writer and Bush said, 'Nah, I stopped believing in those when I turned 12.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Will I enjoy being cursed at 40 hours a week for minimum wage?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'If I find explosive underpants, may I keep them?' Dammit! That was number eight. Who checks these things anyway?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Should I practice by frisking people on the street?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'In five years, whose pants do I see my hands in?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Do I really want to know what a fat guy's thighs feel like?'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is a big TV star is that Sarah Palin. ... Has a show all about Alaska. And last night, did you see the show? We learned on the program last night that the mysterious hatch has something to do with the Dharma Initiative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has a new book,&quot; as does &quot;George W. Bush. ... You know who else has a new book? Snooki. Sarah Palin, George W. Bush, and Snooki. I'm telling you, the Pulitzer Prize race is on. Here we go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new book, 'America By Heart,' comes out tomorrow. ... It can be found next to President Bush's book in the 'Apparently, Anyone Can Write One Of These' section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In her new book, Sarah Palin reveals that she once gave up chocolate for an entire year just to prove that she could do it. Still think she's not qualified to be president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night&quot; is the &quot;grand finale of this season's 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... The three finalists are Jennifer Grey,&quot; Kyle Massey, who is &quot;pretty good, and Bristol Palin, who isn't good at all, but whose mother has an army of Eskimo robots voting for her 24 hours a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Palins dream of a future in which no American will ever be disqualified from a job simply because he or she is unqualified to do that job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that Bristol was a target of a mysterious white powder sent to the 'Dancing with the Stars' studio on Friday. A package came. At first they thought it was Florence Henderson's cocaine delivery but...too soon? She's alive, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody seems to like these pat down procedures, the new ones, very much at all. ... Over the weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would not like to go through the pat downs herself. ... After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'I think we all know where Hillary stands on being touched.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is sort of good news for California, I guess. The turkey that President Obama pardons this year will come from California. ... A spokesman for the turkey said it 'doesn't need a pardon, it needs a job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Pretty scary. North Korea attacked South Korea by brazenly firing mortars into their country. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States said today they're going to step in and try and prevent a border dispute. ... Because, as you know, when it comes to avoiding problems along the border -- oh, we're the experts there, aren't we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, 'Harry Potter'&quot; is the &quot;number one movie in America, making something like $130 million. ... In the latest episode&quot; of the movie series, &quot;Harry loses his friends,&quot; has to &quot;battle overwhelming evil forces,&quot; and &quot;hides in exotic foreign places to avoid public scrutiny. I'm sorry, that's President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a three-hour delay reported at LAX today. ... Apparently, another fat guy got stuck in the full body scanner and they couldn't...get him out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And al Qaeda now bragging that the toner cartridge bomb scare we had last month only cost them $4,200 for the whole thing. See, that's why they were able to save money. They used toner cartridges. If they had used those color inkjet printing things, it would've&quot; cost them a &quot;fortune.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To stop little girls from buying Barbie dolls from America, Iran is coming out with an Iranian version of the Barbie doll. It's about an inch shorter than our Barbie and about an inch taller than Iranian President Ahmadinejad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian Barbie has a lot of accessories like the American one. It even comes with a little bikini, and a pile of rocks to stone her to death with if she wears the bikini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to Vice President Joe Biden,&quot; who recently turned &quot;68 years old. .... You know the one thing you never hear at a Joe Biden birthday party? 'Speech! Speech!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview this week,&quot; Joe Biden &quot;said his dog is smarter than President Obama's dog. Well, he should know. As Vice President, it's his job to clean up after both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Fox News, Sarah Palin said, and I quote -- this is her quote ? 'I want to clean up the state that is so sorry today of journalism, and I have a communications degree.' You know, after that sentence, they might take it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that radiation from Wi-Fi is hurting trees. ... Environmentalists are calling it the 'worst assault on trees since George Bush and Sarah Palin became authors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After...weeks of competition,&quot; the winner &quot;of 'Dancing with the Stars'&quot; is not Bristol Palin, who will now be &quot;deported back to Alaska, to dance exclusively with wolves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's new book, 'America by Heart' came out today, just in time for awkward holiday gift exchanges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'America by Heart' tells the story of Sarah Palin's lifelong struggle to learn to spell the word America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; the book is filled with &quot;mostly...typical Sarah Palin-y stuff. But the chapter on igloo construction is indispensable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ratings&quot; for Sarah Palin's &quot;show on TLC&quot; are &quot;way down. The ratings fell 40%. So, she and President Obama do have something in common after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first day of Hanukkah. ... And President Obama issued his annual Hanukkah message. See, this is what America is all about, when the son of a black Kenyan father and a white Kansas mother, elected president, thanks the Latino voters, issues a statement over his Japanese-made computer, serviced by technicians in India, congratulating the Hebrew-speaking people of a land we took from the Native Americans. That's what this country is all about!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is the latest on our government's top secret, classified documents. We don't have any anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of this WikiLeaks&quot; has &quot;gone into hiding. They say he's some place all alone where no one can find him. In fact, officials believe he may be hiding in a theater showing 'Burlesque.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain said it's time for a 'regime change' in North Korea,&quot; to &quot;which the waitress at Carol's said, 'Sir, if you don't order now, you're going to miss the early bird special.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has booked the entire wing of a hospital in New York City while he recovers from back surgery. If you have enough money, you can get as many hospital rooms as you want. Or, as Republicans call that, 'healthcare reform.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last time we checked in with this 111th Congress, it was before the mid-term elections, when a period of calm and deliberate, shall we say, inaction, had overcome our beloved legislators. Democrats fearing anti-incumbency fever and the loss of their more conservative Blue Dog Coalition avoided any pre-election vote that may have given the country the impression that they were in fact Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans were careful to avoid any vote that might even inadvertently, leading up to the election, improve our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now, the mid-terms have come and gone and these be the last three weeks of 111th Congress. So as you can imagine, time to get to work. 'Harry Reid has told Republicans that in a mere three weeks, he wants to pass a food safety bill, the Immigration 'Dream Act', a repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' for gays in the military, a 9/11 rescue workers relief act, a spending bill for fiscal 2011, an extension of some Bush-era tax cuts and estate tax reform, not to mention the 'New Start' nuclear treaty.' And then on Tuesday...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; President Obama &quot;met with Republican leaders at the so-called 'Slurpee Summit,' so called because many ousted Democrats will soon be working at 7-Eleven.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight at the White House, President Obama is going to hold a ceremony for the first night of Hanukkah. And in response, the Republicans said, 'It's even worse than we thought. He's a Jewish Muslim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Congress say they are against extending unemployment benefits for people who have lost their jobs. You know why? Because most of the people who lost their jobs were Democrats who just got voted out of office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Citigroup is in talks to hire the former White House budget&quot; director, &quot;Peter Orszag. Is this the best guy to run a credit card company? Somebody who put the country $30 trillion in debt? I'm surprised this guy could even get a credit card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with 'don't ask, don't tell,' legislation that was enacted in 1993. It was designed to allow gay people to serve in the military, as long as they told their colleagues that the picture of the ripped, topless...fireman that they had in their foot locker was Cousin Rico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the type of civil rights compromise legislation that typically precedes the more historic, all right, you can have your civil rights, act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives has already voted to repeal. But what about...the Senate? Today, its Armed Services Committee called Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen up to Capitol Hill to discuss a 10-month study of the issue conducted by the Pentagon. It seemed to suggest that individuals of strong enough stuff to volunteer to spend months at a time in a desert hellscape being shot at by Pashtun-speaking hill people, don't seem to be overly concerned...if their brothers in arms like to hold brothers in their arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can often assess the mood of the Senate chamber by its members' opening remarks. Let's try one from flavorless Democrat, Evan Bayh. 'In all likelihood, there were gay Americans serving at Valley Forge. There were gay Americans at Gettysburg.' Evan Bayh, expressing surprise, that despite clear reproductive disadvantages, gay people have somehow been around for hundreds of years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's hear something from Evan Bayh flavored Republican, Susan Collins. 'I was struck by one observation by a special ops operator, who said at a town hall meeting, quote, 'We have a gay guy in the unit. He's big, he's mean, and he kills lots of bad guys. And no one cared that he was gay.' ... So...the reasons for are on the more practical side ? Evan Bayh's they've already been in the Army, and Susan Collins' gay men and women can be just as big and violent as straights. They are a gym-going people, you know. You ever been inside a GNC? You don't want to mess with those guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But really, there was only one senator who mattered in today's hearings, John McCain, a man who in 2006 said he would revisit his views on 'don't ask don't tell' if and when military leadership said it was time. Then, when they said it was time, he said, well, he'd need to see a study. And now that that study has been done, well, this should be interesting. 'I'm troubled by the fact that this report only represents the input of 28% of the force who received the questionnaire. That's only 6% of the force at large.' Boy, you're really going down with the ship, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's like one a them Japanese soldiers living on Okinawa in 1949, still fighting because he doesn't realize the war ended a long time ago. And for some reason, even though he's been alone for years and years on this island, doesn't like gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been devoting a lot of time this week to poring through all 250,000 pages of the WikiLeaks dump. ... Turns out we were just wasting our time. ... Somebody's already taken the trouble of boiling it all down to 140 characters. 'Earlier today, Sarah Palin tweeted, 'Inexplicable: I recently won in court to stop my book, 'America by Heart' from being leaked, but&quot; the 'US Govt can't stop WikiLeaks' treasonous act.&quot; Wow. That is such a good point. Except, you know, you didn't really stop the book from being leaked. You're book was leaked, and is probably still available on mirror sites on the Internet. And, there is the fact that WikiLeaks is in Sweden, and its founder...is Australian. So, really, you can't charge them with treason against America because they're not American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now maybe, she meant that the American who leaked the documents was committing treason. It's a fine distinction she was unfortunately unable to make because she was forced to use 18 of her 140 characters to get in the full title of her book, which totally coincidentally is on sale right now. Not that I would accuse the ex-governor of using a political issue to shamelessly plug her book. Although if you do enjoy scurrilous accusations like that, you'll love, 'Earth (The Book)', the book we at the 'The Daily Show' love.&quot; It is &quot;full of cheap and unfair characterizations and countless, so-called 'jokes.' Plus, it makes a great Christmas present. Buy two. You'll thank yourself later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palin, of course, took to Twitter in order to bypass the 'lamestream' media, which is why the 'lamestream' media, like a teenage boy with a crush on the stuck-up girl who hates him, is now utterly fascinated by everything she tweets. ... It's not going to make her like you. It just makes you look desperate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was so thrilled to learn that European gambling websites...are already laying odds on who the Republican nominee will be for 2012. Leading the pack are the obvious choices, Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, but the third-place contender is South Dakota Senator John Thune. Yeah, that John Thune, the one you've never heard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is interesting. President Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan today. Complete surprise. Nobody knew he was going, except of course the WikLeaks guy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had to cancel a meeting with the Afghan president, Karzai, because of bad weather.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain says the time just isn't right to repeal the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. ... You know what I say? Wait until McCain goes to bed&quot; at, &quot;what, 5:00, 5:30? Then it'll be the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the British press,&quot; the &quot;head of WikiLeaks, who Interpol has issued an arrest warrant for,&quot; is &quot;apparently...hiding in the UK. And Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency acknowledged receiving...that notice from Interpol. That's the name of their police over there. The Serious Organised Crime Agency. Originally, they had notified the Light-Hearted Organised Crime Agency, and I guess they just didn't take it seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigerian authorities are now charging former Vice President Dick Cheney on a bribery scandal. Allegedly, it involves Halliburton. Well, that's when you know you're bad, okay -- when guys in Nigeria accuse you of running a scam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, Cheney has offered to be hooked up to a polygraph. You know, as soon as he's unhooked from the defibrillator.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what that means, being censured?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been released from the hospital after undergoing treatment for a kidney stone. He says he's recovering. Yeah, good luck. That's what he said about the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know anything about this John Boehner,&quot; who is &quot;going to be the new Speaker of the House? ... Here's all I know about him. ... For a long time, he was orange. They thought he had scurvy or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they had an interview with him on '60 Minutes,' with Lesley Stahl. Did you see that on Sunday? Very emotional guy. I think in this day and age in politics you have to be an emotional guy. But come on.&quot; Boehner &quot;will break down and sob just at the drop of a hat. As a matter of fact, Lesley Stahl dropped her hat, and he started crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Thursday is Larry King's final show, and CNN has apparently scheduled a bunch of surprises for it. ... Because if there's one thing you want to give a 77-year-old man who's had quintuple bypass surgery, it's lots of surprises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama showed up 20 minutes late to a press conference. ... It was the longest he's kept everyone waiting. Well, unless you count the past two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at an elementary school, Michelle Obama said that childhood obesity is both an economic threat and a national security threat. ... It was pretty awkward, mainly because she said it all to one chubby kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, Barack Obama's made some mistakes in the first two years of his presidential tenure, but one, I think, stands out in particular. No, not his inability to close Guantanamo Bay or the continuation of Bush era draconian, anti-terror policies or the slower than expected progress in Afghanistan and Iraq or the inexplicable lack of urgency with financial regulations ? look, ease up on the guy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there was one mistake in particular that stands out. It happened last Friday at 4:24 in the afternoon in the White House press briefing. 'I just had a terrific meeting with the former president, President Bill Clinton. I'm going to let him speak very briefly. And then I've actually got to go over and do some -- just one more Christmas party.' 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. First of all, I feel awkward being here and now you're going to leave me all by myself.' You're going to leave that guy, the Michael Jordan of press briefings, in charge while you go to a Christmas party?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama, what are you doing? You think the kind of handsome guy who replaced Clooney on 'ER' ever let&quot; Clooney &quot;back on the set? Not a chance!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Wally Pipp, Mr. President? Of course you don't. Do you know why? Because he sat down for like a day and let Lou Gehrig take a couple of cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, I'm not saying you don't have Jedi potential, but maybe you want to wait until term two before you let Obi-Wan back out in front of the press corps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, Obama faces challenges on other fronts. For instance, the healthcare bill. .. Democrats can always seek judicial remedies for laws they don't agree with, like no gay marriage. It's too bad that Republicans are so virulently opposed to judicial activism. 'A Federal judge in Virginia rules a key plank of...the new healthcare reform law is unconstitutional. Judge Henry Hudson says Congress cannot require Americans to purchase insurance under the Constitution's Commerce Clause.' 'It could turn out to be just the beginning of the end for Obama care.' ... It's a judicial activism miracle. Yes, Virginia, there is a Commerce Clause.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new poll, Congress' approval rating&quot; is at an &quot;all time low of 13%.

But the Senate Republicans have filibustered it, won't allow the bill to come up for a vote. Luckily, yesterday, there was some good news from the Senate. The logjam broke. 'Today, the Senate passed that bill to extend tax cuts to all Americans, including the wealthiest, by an overwhelming 81-19 vote.' Yes! That is astoundingly good news for firefighters that make over $200,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, all non-millionaire firefighters are still...out of luck. Apparently, the party that turned 9/11 into a catchphrase&quot; is &quot;now moving suspiciously into a convenient, pre-9/11 mentality when it comes to this bill. What's more, none of the three broadcast networks have mentioned any of this on their evening newscasts for two and a half months. Although to be fair, it's not every day that Beatles songs come to iTunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Our networks were scooped with a sympathetic Zadroga bill story by the same network that Osama bin Laden sends his mix tapes to. This is insane!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is not a good week for the former US Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell. The FBI is investigating her for misusing her campaign funds to pay for personal expenses like rent, gas, and meals. ... I think it's a witch hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wildlife officials in Kentucky...are now trying to identify what they say is a new species of animal that somebody shot over the holidays.&quot; It has &quot;gray skin,&quot; no hair, and is &quot;completely wrinkled.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from Iran&quot; is &quot;selling his car. It is a 1977 Peugeot. ... I thought...1977 -- that is an old, old car, isn't it?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...is back from Hawaii. And he says he read three books while he was on vacation, or as Sarah Palin put it, 'Show-off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Obama read three books during his vacation. Not to be outdone, Joe Biden says he got through, like, half the 'Sweet Valley High' series.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new governor in California. Former Governor Jerry brown replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't know if I'm comfortable with a governor who's never done steroids ? I don't feel as safe -- and who can pronounce things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The experts have been very critical of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the job he did, but I don't necessarily agree. ... No major earthquakes on his watch. That's something, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold said he might...write a memoir. And if he does, I think I have a good title for it: 'I'll Be Book.' Right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been away for two weeks, having very carefully timed our break to the holiday news lull. ... And I have yet to check up on the outcome of that lame-duck session&quot; of Congress &quot;until this very moment. ... 'Huge legislative victories,&quot; including a &quot;'tax deal to protect the unemployed.' 'The 9/11 first responders healthcare bill.' 'The repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell.&quot; 'The law overhauling the nation's food safety laws.' 'Along with that nuclear weapons treaty with Russia.' 'So, did quite well during this process.' ... Democrats, you need to lose mid-term elections more often. It suits you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If only&quot; Democrats would &quot;completely lose the Senate, we could solve our immigration problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the definitive pronouncements of an Administration's demise, followed nearly instantaneously by a multitude of political victories. As scandals must be suffixed with gate, this can mean only one thing -- to the coin-phrase-o-meter! 'President Obama is being called the 'comeback kid.&quot; ... 'President Obama, is he now the comeback kid?' 'He's the comeback kid.' You were the only ones who said he was dead. You know, the media is like the world's worst paramedics. They declare people dead when they're napping. So of course, waking up must be a miracle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

We may never know what motivated this clearly unbalanced individual, but we do know that now is not the time to lay blame or politicize this tragedy. 'He was obviously a leftist. He admired 'Mein Kampf' and 'The Communist Manifesto.&quot; 'The Tea Party is definitely tolerant of extremism and violence.' ... 'Sarah Palin has blood on her hands.'

Pennsylvania's Mike Fitzpatrick and Pete Sessions of Texas were at a reception for constituents when the rest of the House was being sworn in.' ... That means...Sessions and Fitzpatrick did not become members of the 112th Congress. Now, they had a good excuse for missing the swearing in. They had to be in the Capitol Visitor's Center for a swearing in party&quot; that &quot;Democrats say...violated House ethics rules against fundraising on Capitol grounds. But there is no evidence of fundraising, other than it costs $30 to attend and the invitation contained a credit card payment page and Federal rules for campaign contribution limits. Sorry, Dems. Those rules only apply to members of Congress, and they didn't swear in. Check and mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there has been...a bit of a kerfuffle about whether their votes on legislation should count. I say yes, because they believed they had officially been sworn in. 'The pair said they watched the swearing in on TV, with their hands raised.' They tele-swore in! And everyone knows that oaths made through the TV are legally binding. That's why I'm actually the 44th President of the United States, because right before Obama recited the oath, I shouted it at my Samsung.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that we know that taking the oath of office through your TV makes you a congressman, ladies and gentlemen, here and at home, please raise your right hands.

'Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies foreign and domestic, that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the States, that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of your office upon which you are about to enter, so help you God?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the vote hasn't been without its challenges, such as Sudan's 24% literacy rate, which has led to some creative ballots. 'The ballots clearly lay out the choice for the southern Sudanese people -- clasped hands to remain unified with the north, as they have been for a half century, or an open palm for independence.' Okay, that makes sense. Because the first time I saw it, I thought the choice was between 'want to arm wrestle' and 'I have to use the bathroom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, a tortured people, stepping out from the shadow of genocide, perhaps seeing a glimpse of light for the first time in generations in that country. But, why should I care? I'm an American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Prendergast, co-founder of election monitoring group, The Enough Project, explains why I should care. 'The idea is to try to prevent human rights abuses before they occur by shining a spotlight on the places, on the locations along the border between the north and the south.' ... I'm being told right now by my producer that I didn't hear any of that because, oh my God, that guy is standing next to George Clooney. Oh, my God! That's George Clooney! Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, George Clooney is down in the Sudan, helping to monitor the elections. And I gotta give Clooney cred ?wait a second. Zoom out there. What? Oh, my God! He's there with Cheadle, Damon and Brad Pitt! ... He's not there to monitor the vote. This is a heist! He's there to rob the Sudan's biggest casino!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the recent tragic events in Arizona show us, a scourge of violence is still very much with this country. It's clear that there are going to be no quick fixes, unless there are. 'At least five members of Congress are now planning to introduce new gun legislation. Among them, New York Republican Congressman Peter King, who said today he will introduce a bill that would make it illegal to bring a gun within 1,000 feet of a government official.' Two questions: A. Can the rest of us get us one a them 1,000-foot gun-free perimeters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And B. How's that supposed to work, exactly? How would law-abiding gun owners know how far they are from government officials? Unless the statute also requires government officials to wear, let's say cow bells, and gun owners to carry NFL yardage chains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. ... Thanks for cheering me up because I feel like an idiot, and that's rare. ... And here's why: I have missed the boat on perhaps the greatest financial opportunity of my life.. ... 'Rapper 50 Cent made a big chunk of change by tweeting. He reportedly raked in more than $8 million by giving a business an online shout-out.' 'But the kicker here is that he owns a big chunk of the company. The stock wound up jumping from 10 cents to 35 cents to 40 cents.' It went from 10 cent, to 40 cent. That's why he's Fiddy Cent. That's just math.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what hot fire did Fiddy spit to make it rain eight million dollar, dollar bills, y'all? ... He tweeted: 'HNHI is the stock symbol for TVG. They're launching 15 different products. They are no joke. Get in now.' ... Fiddy made eight ma-zillion dollars without even using all 140 characters. He could have made an extra half mill just by adding ROTFL, which in this case would stand for radically overstepping the financial laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'&quot;I'm pretty sure pumping and dumping here could be at least conceived as unethical, but certainly, it might be illegal, too.' I don't see anything illegal about buying 30 million shares of a penny stock, then instructing your Twitter followers to run up the price. ... Also, SEC, I wouldn't recommend starting a beef with Mr. Cent. Just ask Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Cam'ron, Rick Ross, The Game, Young Buck, and Old Dirty Bernanke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, you know you can trust Fiddy, because I believe Fiddy is short for Fidelity Investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's why I feel stupid, folks. I am the king of Twitter. ... I have merely two million followers. I can't believe I haven't abused their trust to make millions off worthless penny stocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations, Fiddy, for finding a way to make money off Twitter. That is something not even Twitter has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we're all still saddened and disturbed by the tragic shooting in Tucson last Saturday. Unfortunately, there are some who are cynically exploiting this event by suggesting this might possibly be an opportunity to explore, perhaps, discussing, eventually, toning down our angry political rhetoric. 'Those of us in public life and the journalists who cover us should be thoughtful in response to this and try to bring down the rhetoric.' 'What we should be doing is having leaders on both sides lowering the level of the rhetoric.' 'I think it would be better for political discourse if people didn't call each other fascists and socialists and Nazis and Hitler.' An eloquent plea, but you know who else was eloquent? Hitler.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big medical news. The FDA says it will limit the amount of pain reliever in Vicodin, which explains my new substitute for Vicodin -- two Vicodin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been five days since the terrible events in Tucson, Arizona. And last night, the President of the United States paid his respects. Speaking to an audience of thousands at the university of Arizona,&quot; the President &quot;played the role of inspirer in chief. 'If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost. Let's make sure it's not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle.' It was a message not lost on the purveyors of the next news cycle, who across all political lines, roundly praised the President's speech, for nearly two to three minutes, before allowing politics, point scoring and pettiness to kick off its reunion tour. ... 'I thought that speech was particularly courageous.' 'You do have to question the timing of it.' No, no. You don't, have to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are not a primitive nematode,&quot; Michelle Malkin, &quot;capable only of autonomic nervous response to outside stimuli. You have a choice. You went to Oberlin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, once it had been established that the President had successfully delivered a healthy infusion of support, inspiration and comfort to a community in dire need, there was really nothing left to do but just really wonder about the seating arrangement. &quot;I thought it was kind of strange that they didn't put the people'&quot; that &quot;tackled the shooter...in the first two rows.' 'Absolutely. It would have been better.' ... Yeah, yeah. That would have made it much better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That would have made it a better show. But you know, it's a memorial service, not the Emmys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the blessing, by Dr. Carlos Gonzalez, a member of the U of A faculty and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, came under scrutiny. ... 'The Native American who opened up the show, which I found very strange.' It's not a show!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's mourning, with a u. You're confusing a morning show, which you are on,&quot; Brian Kilmeade, &quot;with a show of mourning, which is what this is. Didn't you wonder why no one threw to commercial?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Veteran journalist Brit Hume was even more perplexed. 'Gonzales...blessed, you know, the reptiles of the sea and...prayed to the four doors of the building, and, and, while, I'm sure that all ? that's an honorable tradition with his people, it was most peculiar.' Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like my benediction like I like my coffee ? Christian!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am feeling very unsettled this evening. You see, last night, President Obama spoke at the memorial in Tucson honoring the victims of last weekend's tragic shooting. And, of course, he had to politicize it by doing a great job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I want to be clear here. Even though I found his words touching and pitch perfect, that doesn't change the fact that I spent the last two years calling this guy Hitler. Once you cross that line, you're committed. We all know on Hitler, there are no backsies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've made my bed and I'm going to lie in it. So, in light of the President's inspiring speech, it's time for me to man up and admit, last night, I was moved by Hitler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never thought I'd say this, but Hitler said some really lovely things. Turns out Hitler's much more sensitive than I gave him credit for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I admit that sounds horrible coming out of my mouth. If you want to blame somebody, blame President Obama. He's the one who put a friendly face on Hitler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a speech to Arab leaders and she urged them to enact real reform. ... Halfway through the speech, the Arab leaders looked at each other and asked, 'Why is a woman talking?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Middle East, this is crazy: Disney has announced that they will be opening a theme park in Israel. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say the Chinese own a lot of property here, but while driving down Pennsylvania Avenue, the Chinese president&quot; was &quot;hanging out the window, going, 'Got it, got it, need it, got it, need it, got it, don't want it, got it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow night is the big state dinner. ... And you know, you can see our economy is not going well. It's being catered by Panda Express.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one really awkward moment when the Chinese president met President Obama's young daughters, and he asked them, 'So, what factory do you kids work at?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Wisconsin Republican by the name of Reince Priebus has been elected the new chairman of the Republican National Committee. ... They think this will help get the Republican Party back to its roots -- boring white guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview on the 'Today' show,&quot; former &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney says he may one day need a heart transplant. I understand Halliburton has a new big contract to do the installation on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the debate over repealing healthcare began in the House today. ... And the Republicans have their own plan ? 'Don't Ask, Don't Get Sick.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember a guy named Dick Cheney? He was Vice President, Dick Cheney, with George W. Bush.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great day for China,&quot; whose &quot;president...attended a state dinner at the White House. ... Fox News said it was a 'gathering of the world's most powerful communists, and the president of China.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meeting President Hu must have been confusing for Joe Biden. 'Vice President Biden, Hu is here to see you.' 'I don't know.' We did it. We got it out of the way. You're welcome, Abbott and Costello.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a Fox News interview, Sarah Palin said, 'I won't shut up,&quot; which is good, because President Obama needs a second term. Keep talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney was on the 'Today' show, and he said that he may need a new heart. ... And then, George Bush was on the next hour and asked them for a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House held a big state dinner for Chinese Prime Minister Hu Jintao. And as&quot; is the &quot;custom with the Chinese people, they brought President Obama a gift -- some bootleg DVDs of 'The Green Hornet&quot; and the 'Little Fockers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand President Obama wore a traditional, handmade Chinese garment -- a pair of Nikes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the two leaders had a private dinner. And after the dinner, President Obama went to pick up the check and the Chinese president stopped him and said, 'Your money is no good here.' Obama laughed.&quot; Then Jintao &quot;said, 'No, really, your money is no good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Hu arrived only yesterday. His advance team actually came ten days ago to check out his accommodations. See, they wanted to make sure that wherever he was staying didn't have any of that drywall from China. It's very caustic and you could choke to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans voted today to repeal healthcare reform. And Democrats warned this could make...it harder&quot; for &quot;older Americans to get proper healthcare, to which Hugh Hefner's new fianc?e said, 'Good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an article in 'The Wall Street Journal,' some people buying foreclosed homes are hiring witches...to get the bad spirits out of the houses. ... So, finally, some good news for Christine O'Donnell. She'll have some work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who's down there in Washington? President of China, President Hu, is visiting the US. And the guy says if he likes what he sees, he may put down a deposit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick Cheney &quot;says that he may one day need a heart transplant. And as a matter of fact, yesterday,&quot; Cheney &quot;invited a young couple to spend the night with him at his castle. And then he told them the bridge was out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today he'll go to the Super Bowl if the Chicago Bears are playing in it. Meanwhile, Sarah Palin said she'd go to the Super Bowl if actual bears were playing in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese government has a video installation in Times Square To showcase the work of Chinese people.. ... That's different than the other places in Times Square that showcases the work of Chinese people -- Nike Town, the Gap, the Disney Store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman fainted this morning during a White House welcoming ceremony for Chinese President Hu Jintao. Obama was like, 'Who knows CPR?' And Hu was like, 'No, I don't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of China is in Washington today making an official state visit to the White House. This is like when you are into your bookie for more than you can afford and he stops by your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a state dinner tonight. Jackie Chan was there. That's like if China hosted Obama for dinner and invited Chuck Norris. It's kind of ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guests enjoyed what was described as a quintessentially American dinner. The menu was kept a secret, but in a nod to Chinese tradition, it was prepared by seven-year-olds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Speaker of the House John Boehner was invited to the dinner but chose not to attend. They're calling him an 'orange chicken' in China now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidents Obama and Hu took questions from the media today, which is unusual because Chinese presidents don't typically take questions from reporters without killing them after.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Lieberman announced he won't run for reelection. In a related story, Steven Seagal removes himself from Oscar contention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Obama held a state dinner for the premier of China, Hu Jintao. ... Yes, the world leader with the funny name who grew up in Asia said he 'enjoyed meeting Jintao.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is upset. He says he will not be attending tonight's state dinner because he considers Hu Jintao a dictator. In response, Hu Jintao said, 'You'll have the fish, and you'll like it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Republican-controlled House voted on whether to repeal the healthcare bill. ... If that goes well, they're going to see what they can do about this whole women voting business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while in Washington, the Chinese president stayed at Blair House. ... To make the Chinese leader feel at home, they had his bedroom decorated by Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said yesterday that China has become one of the top markets for American exports, and these exports have helped to support a half a million American jobs. The bad news is, American jobs are all in India.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden had to report for jury duty today. Now, he can get out of jury if he can convince the judge that he can't miss work because his presence at his job is too essential. So you know what that means. He's going to jury duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chinese President Hu Jintao is hinting China may not loan the United States any more money. ... I understand President Obama now talking to him about a reverse mortgage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Austria say they are looking for a bank robber who wears a Barack Obama mask during his holdups. At first, the guy tried using a Sarah Palin mask, but nobody took him seriously so he had to go back...to the Barack Obama mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Postal Service announced today they're planning to close 2,000 branches of postal stations in addition to the almost 500 they were already planning to close. They lost $8.5 billion last year. Maybe in retrospect, making people wait in line while you slowly finish your bag of Hot Cheetos isn't the best idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The post office is a place your parents used to go to communicate before there were text messages. Young people use it less and less. Maybe they should deliver pizza instead of letters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So local post offices will be closing gradually over the course of this year. But don't worry. If you want to wait in line for a couple of hours, you can still always go to the DMV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A court has ruled that Rahm Emanuel is not legally allowed to run for mayor of Chicago, which in Chicago, I believe means, he won.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past Friday, I...saw&quot; that Keith Olbermann was doing his &quot;'last edition of 'The Countdown.' ... Well, nation, as you know, whenever a pundit relinquishes their post, I absorb their audience and their opinions. Because in punditry, as in 'The Highlander,' 'there can be only one.' In the past, I have sucked the news nugget out of broadcasting greats Lou Dobbs and Gene Shalit. As a result, I can now rage against illegals with the cleverest of puns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you can feel it. Change is in the air. ... You see, the Republicans ran on a platform of repealing and replacing Obamacare, all for one reason. 'Obamacare is the biggest job killer we have in America today.' 'This healthcare bill is going to be a job killer.' 'It is a job killer.' 'It's a job killer.' It is a job killer! All those healthy people are going to put grave robbers out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC abruptly ended its relationship with Keith Olbermann last week. And apparently, there is a provision in his contract that states he is not allowed on television for at least six months. Or as industry experts call it, 'the Conan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans and Democrats are going to sit together intermingled at tomorrow's State of the Union address. ... So if for no other reason, just tune in for the raw sexual tension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Chicago court just ruled a couple hours ago that former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel cannot run for mayor of Chicago. ... However, according to Chicago law, he is still perfectly free to purchase the position.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know,&quot; Obama &quot;is such a good speaker and you could see tonight he was trying to appeal to his base, you know, young, tech savvy young people. Like...he's now calling it not the 'State of the Union,' it's the 'Status Update of the Union' address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the speech, the Republicans gave a pre-buttal. Not a rebuttal, a pre-buttal. Doesn't that sound like something every man over 50 should get every year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A CBS survey of all 96 freshmen members&quot; of the US House of Representatives &quot;found at least 21 of them are sleeping in their office. ... The other 75 are already in bed with the oil companies and the tobacco lobbyists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 'Washington Post' columnist is proposing a Sarah Palin-free February. He wants a whole month of news coverage without any mention of Sarah Palin. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year, there's a fun drinking game being played across the country. You listen to the speech&quot; and &quot;every time you think about the actual state of the union, you take a drink. It helps.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama made a major announcement tonight. He's Oprah's half brother. It's ? there's been so much confusion about the birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican response&quot; to Obama's address &quot;was actually somewhat gracious. They said it was a 'pretty good speech for a foreigner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously tonight was the State of the Union, wow, where Barack Obama shocked the nation by calling for the immediate deportation of all those in this country with, and I'm quoting here, 'mongrel French blood.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, America tragically continues to fall behind the Chinese. It seems like no matter what we do, they stay 13 hours ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama focused his State of the Union speech on how to bring prosperity back to America. ... It basically involves all of us convincing Oprah we are her half sister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three Supreme Court justices -- Alito, Scalia and Thomas -- did not attend the address. Taking their place was Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez and Randy Jackson. Randy said Obama sounded 'pitchy, dog.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The terrorist group Hezbollah has taken power in Lebanon, and opponents have declared a 'day of rage,' or as it is known in the middle east, 'Tuesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Congress are pushing President Obama to cut the Federal government's yearly subsidy to Amtrak. .... So far, the most effective way they have suggested to keep Amtrak from getting that money is to send it there on Amtrak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Oscar nominations&quot; have been &quot;announced ... 'The King's Speech' received 12 nominations, including Best Actor for Colin Firth. He plays a nervous leader who has to unite a divided nation -- wait a minute, that's Obama tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that he has a new way to balance our budget, bring our economy back into a surplus. You know how he's going to do that? He's announcing he's Oprah's half brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Biden and Boehner sitting behind the President? Biden wouldn't stop smiling. Boehner wouldn't stop scowling. Looked like the masks of comedy and tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech, President Obama said we have broken the back of the recession. How many feel we've broken the back of the recession? How many feel broke and the recession is back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said our country is facing another Sputnik moment. Which went over the heads of a lot of young people. They think Sputnik is Snooki's older sister.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with Fox News, Sarah Palin -- Sarah Palin on Fox News, what are the odds? -- well, she kept referring to President Obama's slogan, 'winning the future,' as a 'WTF moment.' ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a 'Boston Globe' columnist is now proposing a Sarah Palin-free month. He wants a whole month of news coverage without any mention of Sarah Palin. ... You know what the perfect month would be? November 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, politicians are still arguing over what's in that 2,300-page healthcare law. Healthcare law? We don't even know what's in a Taco Bell burrito.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight in the Middle East, where the revolution in Tunisia has so captivated the world's attention. ... Well, now that thirst for democracy has apparently spread...to Egypt, where protestors have also taken to the streets en masse. 'The first demand you can hear in the chants ? 'Down, down, Hosni Mubarak.' Mubarak has been the president of Egypt for the last 30 years.' What? They...don't like Mubarak? Why do they keep electing him in landslides?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't make any sense. ... I mean, there's only one way you can get elected over and over again with 90% of the vote and that is to be a beloved leader. Oh, really? There's another -- what kind of fist? Oh. iron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What gives? 'The problem for the Administration is we don't know exactly where it's going to go. We need allies in the region.

Ah, the old freedom aspirations of people stability balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want Egyptian people to have freedom, just as soon as we're sure they'll use that freedom for hugging, not hurting.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, we live in this Internet age and in Egypt, the protesters are said to be using Facebook to out maneuver the police, but the police are fighting back. They're using Farmville to build a fence around the protesters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the bookies have put the odds out for this weekend. The Packers are slightly favored over the Steelers. .... And the rioters are slightly favored over President Mubarak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge riots continuing in Egypt. Experts say one of the problems over there is, there's a huge difference in wealth between the extremely rich and the vast majority of people who have nothing. Well, thank God that could never happen in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the most amazing thing to me about what's happening in Egypt: All the rioting, all the fighting, all the anger, and nobody's blaming the Jews. That is progress.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'USA Today,' the Philippines has surpassed India on the number of outsourced call center jobs used by American companies. See, this is what's known as a global economy. We borrow money from China to pay our unemployed workers who lost their jobs in the Philippines, while people in Mexico take jobs Americans no longer want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Vice President, Joe Biden, suggested to people out of work that they just 'hang in there.' .. Oh, what a difference two years makes. Remember 'hope' and 'change'? Now it's 'hang in there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the Pentagon has announced a three-month timetable for the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' There'll be three months before gays can serve openly in the military. They want it to coincide with the season finale of 'Glee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Birthday to Dick Cheney,&quot; who &quot;I think&quot; is now &quot;70 years old. ... Dick celebrated by shooting a cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a party&quot; at &quot;Dick Cheney's house, and he invited 12 people to his birthday party up at his house. And at midnight, he told them, he said, 'Only 11 of you will be leaving here with a heart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with our...coverage of the turmoil in Egypt, or Mess O'Slightly-To-The-Left O'Potamia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is the US government reacting to events on the ground? Here is Hillary Clinton, pre- and post-weekend. 'The Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people. We want to see an orderly transition to a democratic government, to economic reforms exactly, what the protesters are seeking.'&quot; Clinton is &quot;making the US Look like a Mets fan at a Philly game. 'Go, Mets! I mean Phillies!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, even though the United States has expressed support for the protests, we may have some credibility issues with the Egypt street. 'These protestors said the weapons used by the Egyptian forces were made in the USA. You can see it in this photo of a tear gas canister used by the Egyptian forces, the familiar 'Made in the USA' markings on the can.' We write that on our tear gas canisters? Are you kidding me? Do we want people to hate us? Hey you know what? I have an idea. Why don't we write 'Made in China' on our tear gas? And then when we drop food or invent, I don't know, a pillow cannon; that we can brand with our logo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see what's going on here. Hosni, you've been Egypt's dictator for 30 years now. Now the people have issued a, let's say, last call: 'You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.' In fact, you probably shouldn't go to your home. They're probably thinking of lighting it on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now, you don't know what to do. Hosni, let us help you. ... You've got to get out. What are you going to do? Stay? Move to 10:00, hoping nine months later, the same people who kicked you out ask you to come back? Even mobs don't mismanage things that badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, in last week's State of the Union address, President Obama issued our nation a challenge. 'Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs. This is our generation's Sputnik moment.' To the moon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I guess you're saying it would be good if the nation's current predicament could act as a kind of national wake-up call, similar to a Sputnik, blah, blah, blah. Of course, that's not how Fox News' Alaskan bureau chief heard things. 'That was another one of those WTF moments. ... And he needs to remember that what happened back then with the former communist USSR and their victory in that race to space, yeah, they won but they also incurred so much debt at the time that it resulted in the inevitable collapse of the Soviet Union.' ... It wasn't the space race that bankrupted the Soviets. It was the arms race. We should be glad&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;didn't blame it on 'The Amazing Race.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who would purposefully twist around historic facts and put out such a willful misunderstanding of the President's words? You'd almost actually have to be a Soviet agent. Oh, my God. Sarah Palin may be a Russian spy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've all been watching the goings on in Egypt. ... Incredible protests that have riveted the world. ... And the Egyptian government has responded by shutting down most of the country's internet. ... Just a word of advice: If you want people to stay at home and do nothing, you should turn the Internet back on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This puts Americans in a tricky place because Americans say they support Egyptian protestors but they're concerned someone less stable replacing President Mubarak. ... And I think they've got a point, because right now, the favorite candidate is Mohammed Al Gary Busey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department has told Americans scheduled to fly out to Egypt that they should bring their own food and water to the airport. ... And also bring a plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Egyptian authorities have reported -- this is the weirdest thing -- multiple people stealing mummies. ... They're stealing the mummies so they can drive in the carpool lane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, California Governor Jerry Brown ? it's so weird saying that. This news is fresh from 1977.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Jerry Brown delivered his State of the State address. ... It was not very encouraging. Brown opened the speech by asking, 'Anyone got a quarter? I need money here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Al Gore blamed the current snowstorms on global warming. Al Gore said, 'A rise in global temperature creates havoc ranging from hot or dry spells to colder winters, increasing violent storms, increasing flooding, forest fires and loss of endangered species.' And finally Tipper said this: 'Al, just pay the kids to shovel the walk, will you please? Don't give them the speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, big rumor: Sarah Palin said she may run for president. I understand there's an opening in Egypt. Yeah! Works for me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Mubarak came out of the presidential palace today. Saw his shadow. Six more weeks of rock throwing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the rioting in Cairo? ... People in the Middle East have not been this upset since Hulk Hogan pinned the Iron Sheik.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, regarding the crisis in Egypt, that the 'Obama Administration is not advocating or working towards any specific outcome.' Same policy they had during the economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Huntsman,&quot; the &quot;US ambassador to China, has told the Obama Administration he plans to resign. The reason, he said, 'How many nights in a row can you eat Chinese?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'USA Today,' the Philippines has surpassed India on the number of outsourced call center jobs used by American companies. And that is tough to do. I mean, thousands of people whose only language is Filipino had to learn to speak broken English with an Indian accent . That is not easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a good chance for the first time ever, the White House social secretary will be a man. ... Finally, men have broken the glass ceiling and gotten this job. Can you imagine that, having a guy doing the state dinners? Wouldn't that be great? Hooters chicken wings, Domino's, Pizza Hut,&quot; and &quot;KFC. Fantastic.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, something's going on over in Egypt. ... Anderson Cooper was attacked in Cairo yesterday. He was over there reporting for CNN and he and his crew got attacked by a big group of pro-government protesters. He got punched in the head 10 times. ... Let me explain something to you foreigners. ... You keep your dirty hands off our silver fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In their defense, they're in Egypt&quot; and &quot;they're not used to seeing anything that white over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After six days of peaceful protests in Egypt, 30-year president Hosni Mubarak finally took to the airwaves on Tuesday night. 'I tell you very honestly, and regardless of the current circumstance, that I did not intend to run for a new presidential term because I have spent enough time in my life serving Egypt and its people.' ... He's leaving. People have been heard. They can all head back to their lives, let the new Mubarak-less cabinet begin the democratic reform progress. 'I will continue to supervise the new government.' You've not seen this movie, have you? This is not the part where you stay. This is the part where you take a bunch of gold bricks, maybe a priceless artifact, and hop a plane to Dubai.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not going to be good. 'You have now people on the front lines of both sides throwing rocks, throwing bottles.' 'As night fell, we started hearing heavy gunfire.' 'Incendiary devices being launched off the top of that building. That is a very ominous development.' 'Pro-Mubarak forces...were, really, stampeding and attacking some of the anti-Mubarak protesters. The demonstrators, those on camel and horseback.' ... I can't help but notice the pro-Mubarak demonstrators seem to be slightly more organized and are armed and have horses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a spontaneous eruption of pro-Mubarak sentiment from everyday Egyptians trained in the art of whip-based crowd control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't like where this is going. 'We were set upon by pro-Mubarak supporters, punching us in the head. The crowd kept growing, kept throwing more punches, kicks. Suddenly, a young man would come up, look at you, and then punch you right in the face.' All right, Hosni, now you've gone too far. Hands off Anderson Cooper! There is not to be a silvery wisp out of place on that man's glorious head!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight! Egypt in crisis. We must break our dependency on foreign turmoil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the protests in Egypt continue. I've been saying all along ? occasionally -- that we need to stick by our ally, Hosni Mubarak. And today I was happy to see that the Mubarak supporters have finally taken to the streets to stand up for the rule of law. 'Supporters of Hosni Mubarak are whipping anti-government demonstrators.' ... 'We started to see hundreds and then thousands of pro-Mubarak protesters.' An important point ? they are not truncheon-wielding government thugs. They are pro-Mubarak protesters who spontaneously bussed themselves into Cairo and Alexandria at the exact same time, with weapons, to support Mubarak's safe and stable government by causing violent chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an authentic, grass-roots movement -- at least as authentic as grass in Egypt&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these days,&quot; it &quot;seems like you can't have an armed street mob without it turning ugly. And unfortunately, one of the exquisite works of art in the region was damaged -- namely, Anderson Cooper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who today was punched 10 times in the head. 'It was pandemonium. I mean, there was really no control to it. Suddenly a young man would come up, look at you, and then punch you right in the face.' It's worse than we thought. Cairo has turned into the 'Jersey Shore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they heard a Muslim president stepped down, the Tea Party said, 'Obama's leaving?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the rumor is Mubarak left the palace and is now staying at a beach resort. I think it's a Sandals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you figure it's better than staying in the palace all weekend and getting stoned, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mubarak's salary as president of Egypt was $850 a month, and he managed to acquire $70 billion to $80 billion. So that is a good 401(k).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's worth $70 billion to $80 billion. You know, for the young people that can't comprehend how much money that is, let me put&quot; it in other &quot;terms. Imagine inventing Facebook, like, eight times. That would be the equivalent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what made Mubarak the angriest? Just the fact that people were forcing him to resign while the coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers still has a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the ad for this new movie 'Battle of Los Angeles?' In the film, LA is invaded by aliens. Well, how ridiculous is that? Imagine Los Angeles overrun with aliens. What a ridiculous idea! Like that could ever happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Keith Olbermann has a new job working for Al Gore on Al Gore's channel, Current TV. ... He'll be an investigative reporter. His job? Find anyone who's watching Current TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 2006, Dick Cheney took his buddy hunting. Remember that? Took his buddy hunting and said, 'Hey, Larry, I think there's something over there.' And then, ba-boom!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk about time. I mean, that was five heart attacks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say that Dick Cheney, in spite of all his heart problems and being an older fellow,&quot; has &quot;not mellowed. As a matter of fact, I heard a report earlier today&quot; that &quot;he punched Naomi Campbell's assistant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day on 'Live With Regis and Kelly,' First Lady Michelle Obama said she was expecting jewelry on Valentine's Day. Of course, she said, 'You can't go wrong with jewelry.' Lindsay Lohan said, 'Oh yeah you can.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight! Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak steps down, on to a pillowy mound of money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you all out there are celebrating St. Valentine's Day in the traditional conservative manner: Writing poems; exchanging chocolates; and posting topless beefcakes shots on Craigslist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now one person out there&quot; who &quot;is having a bit of a rough Valentine's Day is Hosni Mubarak. It seems he was extremely jilted by 80 million Egyptians on Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, according to insiders, he's suffering a 'severe psychological condition.' ... Cheer up, Hosni. You need to get back on that camel! Go out there and get one of those personal ads. You know, deposed Arab male 'seeks fit, fun-loving population for walks on beach/brutal suppression. No fatties.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as soon as I saw the Egyptian people battling in the streets, I knew that as a journalist, it was my duty to get on a plane and fly straight to the Luxor Casino in fabulous Las Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No way I was going to Cairo. I saw what they did to Anderson Cooper. And frankly, if I'm going to get stampeded and punched in the head, it had better be at the prime rib buffet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now while I was there, over a couple of hands of Pai Gow poker, I got to thinking who's behind this sudden overthrow of the Egyptian government? Now a lot of people point to a generation of young, tech-savvy, unemployed Egyptians who wanted a better future for themselves and their children. Simple answer. And sure, Occam's razor say the simplest answer is usually correct. But fortunately, Glenn Beck isn't allowed near razors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama told Regis and Kelly she was expecting jewelry on Valentine's Day. But she said it wouldn't be anything extravagant because Barack tends to be responsible when he's spending his own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Missouri, Republican State Senator Jane Cunningham has introduced a bill that would eliminate her state's child labor laws. Well, yeah. I mean, why should the 10-year-olds in China be getting all the good factory jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave his first press conference of the year this morning to discuss his budget proposal for 2012, which probably won't get much support in Congress since they still haven't passed the budget for 2011. Though to be fair, they've been busy posting shirtless photos of themselves on Craigslist.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Egypt's&quot; revolution has &quot;touched off...an outpouring of support for the Egyptian people from around the world, some of that support coming from unusual quarters. 'The nation of Egypt, it is your right to be free and it is your right to practice your sovereignty, selecting the type of government, the administration, the rulers...' ... That is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad standing with Egypt, on the 32nd anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution. By the way, if you're thinking of getting them something, I believe the 32nd anniversary is the enriched uranium anniversary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps you can pick some up at Mislabeled Crate and Barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad supporting a free people's right to expression and assembly, which is great news. Because I know that yesterday, Iranian opposition groups were planning a large-scale peaceful protest much like the ones richly praised by Ahmadinejad. This must have been a love-fest. 'Iranian security details are out in force, firing tear gas and beating back protestors with batons.' Batons of love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out the Iranian regime is only into freedom for Egyptians. I've got to tell you, Mahmoud, with that attitude; I think you're going to have a tough time getting re-elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course the Middle East isn't the only place where citizens are calling for an overthrow of the government. There was also a group of revolutionaries closer to home, specifically at the Wardman Park Marriott in Washington, DC, where prominent Republicans gathered for CPAC, the conservative political action conference that was last year referred to as the 'Republican Woodstock.' What's this year's theme? 'The President went from change you can believe in to can you believe this change?' 'The way things are going, Obama...might want to look into becoming the President of Egypt. Nobody would complain about him being a Muslim then.' Boom! Hey, it's like a roast! This year it's a roast. It's like one of them Comedy Central things, only with Barack Obama as their Pamela Anderson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I am not surprised...you are on your feet and chanting because this is an historic week. There have been demonstrations all over the world, including the Middle East: ... Of course, the country that started this freedom-nami was Egypt, because I don't know where Tunisia is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, frankly, I'm conflicted, folks. On the one hand, I'm moved by the footage of jubilant Egyptians dancing in the streets in celebration of freedom. But on the other hand, I am terrified by the footage of unruly Muslims rioting in the streets because they hate us for our freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bottom line,&quot; Egyptians &quot;will elect the wrong candidates. 'Right now, if the elections are today, the...Muslim Brotherhood wins.' ... 'It's almost a certainty that the Muslim Brotherhood gets in.' They are shoe-ins, folks. A recent poll found that the Muslim Brotherhood has a 15% approval rating in Egypt. And in a presidential straw poll, they got one percent. One percent! Those are John Thune numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly the Muslim Brotherhood is going to seize power in Egypt and make it an enemy of America, which is great. Great news. We could go back to fighting a country instead of a shadowy network. I mean, Egypt has infrastructure. We can blow up a bridge again. A bridge! If we wanted to blow up a bridge in Afghanistan, we have to build it first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we can bring the people of Egypt democracy. Because we have the innate genetic ability for it. I mean, almost 25% of us voted last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation,&quot; 2012 is &quot;just around the corner, and everybody's dying to predict the Republican who can beat Obama. Well, remember just two years before Obama announced his candidacy, he was a state senator. Clearly, state legislatures are the presidential minor leagues, in that Wednesdays are also quarter beer night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which brings me to the latest installment of 'Mr. Smith Goes to the State Legislature and Then Later Possibly Washington': Tonight's rising star&quot; is &quot;Republican Arizona State Senator Ron Gould. In the wake of the shooting in Tucson, Senator Gould is protecting those most at risk: Our guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With his new bill, SB-1201, the 'Firearms Omnibus' -- which incidentally is also the name of the Palin family minivan&quot; ? Gould &quot;would allow Arizonans to carry concealed firearms without a permit into all government-run facilities, including the state Capitol building, university classrooms. as well as city buses.&quot; That last one is &quot;long overdue because if Rosa Parks were packing heat, she could have sat wherever she damn well pleased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gould's bill also legally protects anyone who forgets that they are carrying a gun and then tells a police officer that they aren't. Because in Arizona, it should not be a crime to forget to tell the police you're armed, though it is still a crime if you forget to tell the police you're a Mexican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was having a bit of an off-day today? President Obama. At a press conference, he accidentally swore. You can see it on his new sitcom, ' $#*! My President Says.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Iran, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in widespread protest. ... The protests were said to be inspired by Egypt and Justin Bieber getting robbed at the Grammys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this is true,&quot; but it is &quot;being reported&quot; that &quot;former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is thinking of moving to Los Angeles. ... Of course, because you get him a roommate, you know, he's really hard to evict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a news conference in Washington today. He came out inside a giant egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he was all business. He came out, talked to everybody in the meeting, and he said, 'Who is Esperanza Spalding? Who the hell is that? Best new artist? ... Justin Bieber got robbed at the Grammys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards testified under oath this week about an alleged sex tape featuring him and his mistress, Rielle hunter. And you know, typical sleaze ball lawyer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Edwards&quot; is &quot;concerned that this tape might get out. And do what, ruin his reputation?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, foreign affairs experts are predicting the revolution of Egypt will cause a domino effect, which -- does that mean anything to young people? Do kids even know what dominos are? ... 'Oh, man, they're going to be invaded by really bad pizza.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a surprising thing. It was in the 'Wall Street Journal.' A survey found 61% of people are afraid of outliving their money more than they are of dying.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in San Francisco today meeting with a group of technology executives including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Clarence Thomas &quot;has come under attack. This time from left wing legal loons Common Cause. First they raise a big stink just because Thomas didn't report his wife's income of nearly $700,000 she earned from the conservative Heritage Foundation. Nothing to see here, folks. Because Thomas explained that his wife's earnings were quote 'inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions.' How was he supposed to understand filing instructions? The man is only one of the nine most brilliant legal minds in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidents Day. You know the story about President Lincoln -- supposedly true -- that he once walked three miles...when he was a young man to repay a penny. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crisis in Libya. ... They want Moammar Gadhafi to step down. People rioting in the streets. Boy, I didn't see that coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they want Moammar Gadhafi to leave but the problem is he will be replaced by his idiot son, Moammar W. Gadhafi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Presidents Day, everyone. ... Presidents Day, of course, is when we celebrate American history by enjoying a great deal on mattresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

'State workers, a lot of them teachers, furious over Gov. Scott Walker's plans to cut their benefits and collective bargaining rights.' ... That can't be right. Take away a union's right to collective bargaining, I believe that makes them...just a bunch of people wearing identical tee shirts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told you...this Egypt uprising would spread turmoil in the Middle East. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, was Presidents Day. And I celebrated in an efficient manner, by acting like a president: Took someone else's money and spent it on something I didn't need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you watching these protests? You know, it is scary there. They're shouting. They're burning people in effigy. They're marching. And that's just in Wisconsin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is going on in Libya? Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi went on TV today. He was angry and defiant, and then he went off the air, and no one has seen him since. ... Kind of like Keith Olbermann.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, Gadhafi said he will fight the protesters to the end and he will die a 'martyr.' To which the protesters said, 'Deal. Works for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gadhafi &quot;spoke today. He went on for like an hour. He was babbling. ... I'm not saying he was rambling, but even Joe Biden went 'Come on. Get out with it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new report has found that the Federal government spends $18 billion a year on job training programs. They started up these programs because of the fear that untrained workers would end up where untrained workers usually end up, working for the Federal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans now threatening to shut down the government. Hey, we are trillions of dollars in debt. We run massive deficits every year. We're not even close to balancing the budget. Shut it down? I say let's burn it down for the insurance money. That's what we should be doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Dakota Senator John Thune announced he will not be running for president in 2012. I think I speak for all Americans when I say, who?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is terrible. Police in Chicago found...bodies&quot; that &quot;were stacked eight deep at a local cemetery. You know why they were stacked up? They're waiting to vote for mayor today in Chicago's election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In Gadhafi's Address:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Announced intention to return next week to the set of 'Two and a Half Men'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Ran down the various spellings of his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Delivered entire speech in hilarious 'Gadhafi duck' voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Tearful shout-out to his good friend, Jack LaLanne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Referred to himself as a 'mamma grizzly'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Will leave early to do some freestyle pickin'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Had some tough but fair straight-talk for Lindsay Lohan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Rushed things along so he wouldn't miss tonight's all new episode of 'Glee'. Who knew he was a gleek?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Listed his favorite Kardashians from 'hottest' to 'nottest'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even he can't believe how much the Knicks gave for Carmelo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Geographic Channel has a new show that gives an inside look at the Secret Service. ... It's called 'Ruining the Whole Point of the Secret Service.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh yesterday had some unkind words for the Obamas. I know, I couldn't believe it, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his show,&quot; Limbaugh &quot;criticized Michelle Obama for eating ribs for dinner while on vacation in Colorado. He said Mrs. Obama is a hypocrite because she promotes healthy eating and ate ribs. ... Isn't that the morbidly obese pot calling the kettle African-American?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limbaugh &quot;said she doesn't look like she follows her own dietary advice. I love that Rush is commenting on somebody else's weight. This guy would eat his own ribs if you put sauce on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight in Washington. In this season of fiscal discipline, House Republicans are discovering that cutting spending isn't as easy as they had hoped. It turns out people like some of the things government does for them. Luckily, the Republicans have come up with a brilliant idea. What if instead of cutting services for 'people', they cut services for 'women'? ... So they want to cut everything from family care to child nutrition. It's like the Republicans are saying you can't prevent an unwanted child, you can't get care if you do get pregnant, and we won't give you any help feeding the kid after it's born. But, those two minutes when that skull is crowning, your baby's the most precious thing on Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you've been watching the news, folks, but the world is on fire. The uprising in the heartland has spread now to Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio on this, day 8 of 'Turmoil in the Middle West.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It all started when Wisconsin descended into beer-battered chaos. ... The situation in Madison is degenerating like a cheese log in the sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scott Walker is using the new Republican majority to heroically strip state employees of the right to negotiate and, of course, the Democrats were too cowardly to stand and fight. 'Fourteen state Senate Democrats skipped town.' 'The Democratic lawmakers are basically on the lam right now.' 'Instead of having to go up against this vote, they just decided to high tail it, head for the border. They fled the state.' 'With them out of state, there weren't enough senators to vote on the bill.' Outrageous! A minority party should not use parliamentary tricks to grind the government to a halt, except on the Federal level!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody knows where these 14 Democratic senators are and they say they will stay in hiding as long as necessary to prevent a vote. Well, I'm going to do what no one else seems to be able to do. I'm going to smoke out a Wisconsin state Democrat using my patented Democrat call. 'NPR! NPR! Legalize pot! Legalize pot!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone wondering right now what's going to happen with Moammar Gadhafi,&quot; who &quot;may be unseated. That's what people are kind of hoping for. ... He gave a very defiant speech today.&quot; He &quot;said people protesting against him are quote, 'under the influence of hallucination pills.' ... In a related story,&quot; Charlie Sheen has &quot;boarded a plane for Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These protests are spreading all over the globe. Any aging dictator in the world who's been in power for decades is starting to feeling the heat. In fact, like today, at the Playboy Mansion, Hugh Hefner turned the water cannons on a group of rioting playmates who were calling for his ouster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the king of Saudi Arabia announced today he's giving his people $37 billion in pay raises, housing subsidies and unemployment benefits. He says it is not a stimulus package, it's more of a, 'please don't overthrow my a#s' package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the king of Saudi Arabia returned to his country today following back surgery. ... I don't know how he hurt his back, but I think we can rule out bending over backwards to keep oil prices low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is scary. Economists say with all this unrest, gas prices could rise to $5 a gallon this summer. ... Of course, the good news&quot; is that &quot;instead of all this money going to ruthless American-hating dictators, it will go to ruthless American-hating democracies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, in a defiant speech on state television, Moammar Gadhafi said, 'I will not leave and I will die as a martyr.' I'm sorry. That was the governor of Wisconsin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying Moammar Gadhafi is only in control of a small portion of Libya,&quot; which is kind &quot;of like being mayor of Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell Gadhafi is getting more and more desperate. First, he says the protesters are all on drugs. Remember that yesterday? He said they were all on drugs. Then he blamed the uprising on al Qaeda. And today, he said it's all the fault of the teachers union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama talked about the situation in Libya. And later tonight, Pauly D will talk about 'The Situation' on 'Jersey Shore.' So we'll get...both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protesters in China...held up signs outside the Libyan embassy that said, 'The game is over, get out, you're finished.' See, apparently, anti-government demonstrations are allowed in China as long as you're demonstrating against somebody else's government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is depressing. Analysts said today that $4 gasoline...could be in our future. You know what that means? Apparently, the guy who owns the gas station near my house is from the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today in the paper the price of a barrel of light sweet crude is over a $100. That's what they call it. Light, sweet crude. See, that's when you know it's getting expensive, okay, when they start describing it like a bottle of fine wine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the reason it's a $100 a barrel is all the uncertainty in the Middle East. And a related story, because of all the uncertainty in Wisconsin, the price of Cheez Whiz, $80 a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Rahm Emanuel,&quot; who has &quot;been elected mayor of Chicago. ... Well, in his acceptance speech yesterday, Rahm said his first order of business when he takes office, actually moving to Chicago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Harry Reid is now calling for an end to prostitution in the state of Nevada. ... Hey, you thought there were big protests in Wisconsin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are 28 legal brothels in Nevada. ... Well, actually&quot; it is 30, &quot;if you count the state House and...Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Minutes after Harry Reid told the legislature it's time to outlaw prostitution -- this is real -- dozens of hookers converged on the state house to protest. ... The legislators and the hookers had to pretend they didn't know each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Louisiana, two men have been arrested for selling marijuana out of an ice cream truck. Police said they got suspicious when they saw the ice cream truck driving around in February. Kind of a dead giveaway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight,&quot; Moammar Qaddafi &quot;gave another speech. Everybody in Libya set their Betamax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, Qaddafi said that he blames Osama bin Laden for all of the trouble in Libya. ... It's going to be awkward when these two guys meet in hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may not know that WikiLeaks is protected by a global hacker nerd brigade known as 'Anonymous', whose commitment to openness and free exchange of information is right there in the name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anonymous attacks whoever attacks Wikileaks. Now WikiLeaks claims they have incriminating files from a major US bank proving corporate malfeasance. Some speculate that's Bank of America, mostly because Bank of America says, 'That sounds like us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I'm so excited about next year's presidential election that I am beside myself, which will come in handy because I'm planning to vote twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my favorite part of the election cycle. With so many potential GOP candidates flirting with running for office, it's like waiting for somebody to ask you to the prom so you're not stuck going with that creepy guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi described President Obama as an African of Muslim decent. Immediately after the speech,&quot; Gaddafi &quot;was given his own show on Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gaddafi &quot;said something really interesting today. He's now blaming the unrest in his country on Osama bin Laden. ... When reached for comment, bin Laden said, 'Sweet Jesus, don't link with me with that nut job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big story out of Washington. The White House is considering supporting same-sex marriage. ... Experts attribute the change to shifts in popular opinion, recent court changes, and President Obama accidentally catching this week's episode of 'Glee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story remains the stand-off in Wisconsin. ... It is day 14 in the stand-off between Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and anyone the state he runs has ever hired. And while there is little movement in the negotiation, the battle has taken an unexpected turn. ... 'As protestors celebrated, crews began to clean the building that has taken on the odor of hundreds of people sleeping there.' ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real issue in all this is simple. The country's broke. Whose fault is it? Wall Street? Main street? Sesame Street? Why didn't you warn us, Count? ... Seriously, his only job is to count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, one thing we could do is not extend the Bush tax cuts to the top 2% of the country.

'Instead of spending more, why Don't we lower corporate tax rates to create investment and jobs.' ... 'I quite frankly think that they'll be extending the Bush tax cuts.' ... Oh, okay.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night,&quot; the &quot;cyberterrorists&quot; in &quot;Anonymous&quot; declared &quot;war on Americans for Prosperity, a group that supports Wisconsin Governor Scott walker in his fight against the unions.&quot; The group was &quot;founded by two conservative billionaires the Koch brothers. ... 'These two incredibly powerful, wealthy industrialists come out swinging against things like cap and trade policies because they've got a history of polluting in a very big way.' ... 'These billionaire brothers who inherited the private energy company, Koch Industries, from their father.' Yes, it is a family business.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...you can tell&quot; that Qaddafi is &quot;crazy because he says his people still love him. ... I think that's what he said. It's hard to hear over the rebel gunfire, but I think that's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...Qaddafi was on TV yesterday. And he blamed al Qaeda...for the trouble in Libya. He threatened more bloodshed and then he also -- I thought this was nice -- he congratulated Natalie Portman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, UN Ambassador Susan Rice said Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi 'sounds delusional and disconnected from reality.' When he heard that, Gadhafi was like, 'Duh, winning.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday marked a significant anniversary in presidential politics. It was on February 28, 2007, that John McCain declared his candidacy for the presidency on David Letterman's show, a candidacy that we all learned 20 months later, would not float.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because John McCain was so eager to ultimately be defeated, he declared nearly two years in advance of the presidential election. Two years. A bit of political eagerness and timing that placed his entry into the race a cool 12th, behind Democrats Biden, Clinton, Obama, and Edwards, and Republicans Giuliani, Huckabee and Brownback, to name the ones whose name you would know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So here we are. Yesterday was February 28. We know Obama's running. If...the country doesn't let him down,&quot; and if &quot;he still wants us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though none of the candidates have officially announced they're running for president, they have to answer as to why they won't. For instance, Tim Pawlenty, successful conservative governor of a traditionally blue state. 'You know the general rap on you, which is you're too nice, that at the end of the day, maybe not enough pizzazz for the presidency.' ... 'You can look at pizzazz or people's records and what they stand for and got done. I'll take results over pizzazz any day of the week.' Spoken like a man with no pizzazz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's turn down the heat a little and look at small seat conservative fiscal superstar Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. 'Finally, Governor, some people have suggested that you don't look presidential. Barack Obama's 6'1, you're 5'7, he's charismatic and, forgive me but some people suggest perhaps you're not.' 'You know, sure, if it comes down to height and hair, I probably wouldn't do very well.' I've got some bad news for you, sir. It comes down to height and hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, you may want to talk to Mike Bloomberg and see if the two of you could run as one individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't there anybody out there with executive experience, some fiscal chops, and an eight foot wingspan. ... It's Mitt Romney! Former Olympic CEO, governor of Massachusetts, and, let's say, 82-time grandfather who on paper and in head shots has always been president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if Mitt Romney were available to be bought in stores, he would be sold as Barbie's president friend, Mitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin has &quot;got the pizzazz, the hair, the reality show, she's got Facebook accounts up the Twitter, and was so accomplished as governor, she graduated early. What is she up to? 'What is it that in your mind would be a reason to run?' 'A reason to run is if nobody else were to step up with the solutions that are needed to get the economy back on the right track.' Wait a minute, you know how to get the economy back on the right track? And you're not going to tell us?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muammar Gaddafi is constantly entertaining. They call him, quote, 'disconnected from reality.' He thought this year's Oscars were fantastic. He didn't see what the problem was. Lots of good laughs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you watched the news today, another day of just crazy ranting and nonsensical comments by someone we used to love very much. But enough about Mike Huckabee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this story? Top Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee caused a huge national controversy after he said President Obama grew up in Kenya even though the President didn't even visit there until he was in his 20s. Remember when people accused him of being a secret Muslim? Huckabee could be a secret moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Wisconsin, a new poll shows that Republican Governor Scott Walker's attack on public employees is making him more and more unpopular with his own constituents. They feel he is attacking his own people, which is not good. The only other guy doing that right now&quot; is &quot;Moammar Gadhafi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what Gadhafi said today? He said, 'My people love me.' ... Then he said something really crazy. He said he had 'camel blood and Ali Baba DNA.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the President of Mexico arrived in Washington yesterday. In fact, nobody knew when he was going to arrive. He just kind of snuck in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair, he said...he is only here to 'do the work American presidents won't do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his battle to balance Wisconsin's budget, Governor Scott Walker has finally put his proposals on the table. He is, in addition to stripping teachers and public workers of most of their collective bargaining rights, cutting $800 million from the Wisconsin public school's budget over the next two years, as well as restricting local municipalities the ability to raise property taxes to make up for any shortfalls. In essence, he has put public sector unions on notice, and particularly teachers, that the gravy train is over, even if it the gravy is actually lunch room, cafeteria-grade, gravy-like rehydrated slurry chips.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With 2012 right around the corner, everybody out there wants to know what Republicans are going to run for president. And somehow, and I don't know how, Fox News has the inside scoop. 'Effective today, March 2nd, Fox News has suspended its contributor arrangements with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, both of whom have signaled possible runs are for the president.' What the wha-huht?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suspended?! With these two off the air, how will I ever know how conservatives feel about taxes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who cares if they're signaling they're running for president? You know how I signaled I was running for president? I ran for president, in the 'Hail to the Cheese,' Stephen Colbert's 'Nacho Cheese Doritos' 2008 Presidential Campaign.' Okay. I didn't suspend me from my show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever I reported on it, I just added the word 'coverage,' to distinguish between when I was speaking as a candidate, speaking as a journalist, and speaking as a corporate shill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox, I think you're setting a bad precedent here. Because a lot of your contributors have signaled that they might be running for president. If you suspend&quot; Gingrich and Santorum, &quot;next you're going to have to suspend Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin,&quot; and &quot;John Bolton. Luckily this does not affect Glenn Beck, because, based on his show, he's looking past 2012 and running for archduke of the post apocalyptic after-state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

'One of the things that's troubling is that people see a Natalie Portman or some other Hollywood starlet who boasts of, 'Hey, look, you know, we're having children. We're not married, but we're having these children and they're doing just fine.&quot; What are you thinking, Governor? Look, I'm no fan of single mothers either, but it's Natalie Portman we're talking about. That kid she's pregnant with is Luke Skywalker!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, I mean logically, if you're against&quot; Portman's &quot;pregnancy, that means you have aligned yourself politically with Emperor Palpatine. You're alienating all of Tataouine! It's a swing planet!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is just the latest. He also dropped this Huckabomb about Obama's childhood on New York's WOR Radio. 'If you think about it, his perspective as growing up in Kenya with a Kenyan father and grandfather, their view of the Mau Mau Revolution in Kenya is very different than ours. Because he probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.' ... In case you missed it, he said Obama grew up in Kenya with his Kenyan father, Kenya, Kenya, Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But after being called out for the inaccuracy, Huckabee took personal responsibility by sending someone else to admit he was wrong, saying, 'Governor Huckabee simply misspoke when he alluded to President Obama growing up in 'Kenya.' The governor meant to say the President grew up in Indonesia.' Okay? He simply misspoke, for five minutes, .about the Mau Mau Revolution, which he evidently thought happened in Indonesia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important thing isn't where the Mau Mau Revolution happened, the important thing is for people to start associating Barack Obama with the words Mau Mau.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Huckabee's comments ticked me off, not because I disagree with him, folks. But because he didn't make them when he was on my show just one week ago. When he was here, he gave me nothing. Come on, Governor. I'm on your side! I want the juicy stuff you give other people, like this bold statement you made on gay marriage. 'The ideal world, it's a man and a woman. You don't go ahead and accommodate every behavioral pattern that is against the ideal. That would be like saying, well, there are some people who believe in incest, so we should accommodate them.' Yes, gay marriage and incest are basically the same thing. That's Westboro Baptist Church territory. That's the red meat I'm talking about. By the way, we shouldn't let gay people marry red meat either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the break I was forced to put Mike Huckabee on notice. And every second he's on notice, he's getting further from the White House. He better step up and appease me fast because now the man we have been begging to lead us since 1994, former Speaker of the House and current Cabbage Patch adult Newt Gingrich has announced that he is officially running for president, kind of. 'At this point we have an exploratory website. ... And my expectation is that by the end of this exploratory process...we'll have an announcement and we'll be in the race.' I think we'll all sort of remember where we were when he almost said he might be running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will Newt commit to us? The suspense is killing me. I feel like one of his wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historic times. They're winding down the space shuttle program. It's coming to an end. ... The last Discovery space shuttle mission is currently underway.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may remember&quot; that &quot;Barack Obama was swept into office on a mantra of hope and change, a reawakening of progressive values perhaps best exemplified by his promise to tear down a powerful symbol of executive power run amok and foreign policy excess from the Bush years. 'I hereby order, and we then provide the process whereby Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.' One year! 'We need not make the false choice between our safety and our ideals,' said the young, apparently incredibly naive president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Giving us a year to stop the practice of indefinite detention and begin trying Guantanamo prisoners on these gloried shores. Well, funny story. Actually, story. 'President Obama says the US will resume military trials for terror detainees at Guantanamo Bay.' That message, of course: Fu#k them. Fu#k 'em and feed 'em frijoles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And wait. There's more. 'Even President Obama now acknowledges that some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may, in fact, have to be held indefinitely without ever facing trial.' 'They say these are dangerous people, but we don't have enough evidence to try them anyway, so we're just going to keep them there.' I'm not a lawyer. I'm neither Jacoby, nor Meyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I always thought the point of evidence was that if you didn't have enough, you're not allowed to keep them in prison. It's one of the many differences we have in this country between prisons and zoos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what -- at least liberals will always have NPR to raise their spirits. 'A video released by conservative political activist James O'Keefe today showed the top fundraising executive for National Public Radio criticizing Republicans and calling the Tea Party 'racist.' Oh, son of a... Liberals got O'Keefeed again!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich isn't the only Republican candidate who is officially not yet running for president in 2012. So are not Romney, Palin,&quot; and &quot;Bachmann.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, folks, the fight against turban sprawl moved to Congress, where New York Republican Peter King held a vital hearing on the extent of radicalization among American Muslims. It's about...time. We have got to learn why American Muslims are so alienated. Hopefully, these hearings about how dangerous they are will make them feel more welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if anyone can understand violent radicalism, it's Peter King. After all, he is a fervent supporter of the Irish Republican Army. Now before you judge him, you have to understand King saw his Northern Irish Catholic brethren persecuted simply because of their faith.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, as King points out, 'The fact is, the I.R.A. never attacked the United States. And my loyalty is to the United States.' Exactly.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why they call him 'President O-bomb-a.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're now bombing Libya. ... But according to the Pentagon, US military involvement in Libya is limited and has a definite end date. ... I think it'll end as soon as gas goes to three bucks a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; at a &quot;press conference, President Obama said we're going to send economic aid to Libya to help those people reach their dreams. And if it works there, we might even try it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama on a six-day trip to Latin America. I didn't even know he was coming to L.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Obama &quot;is in Chile. ... I don't want to say the President is slow when it comes to reacting to a crisis, but while he was in Chile, the President said, 'America is willing to do whatever it takes to get those miners out of there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin on a trip to India and Israel. I don't think she really gets it. You know what she said when she landed in India? 'Aloha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, after India,&quot; Palin &quot;went to Israel, where she had dinner with Netanyahu. And she told him they had a lot in common. For example, she said in America she is 'also known as a yahoo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Congressional Budget Office announced that President Obama has understated the deficit by $2.3 trillion over the next ten years. They say his basic math was off by $2.3 trillion. Well, that should prove once and for all he is an American born citizen who went to school in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says that we'll be out&quot; of Libya in a couple of weeks. Well, &quot;that's good enough for me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me translate that for you: Ten year quagmire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're calling it 'Operation Odyssey Dawn.' Odyssey Dawn. I believe it's the first military operation named for a stripper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got a war going in Iraq. We're in that one. War going in Afghanistan. We got a war going in Libya. You need a bracket to keep track of this stuff. ... I think in the final game, it will be Butler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin made her first trip to Israel today. Palin said, 'I like people of all religions, whether they celebrate Christmas or Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in South America right now, but the White House says he's getting regular updates on the situation in Libya. On an unrelated note, does anyone else think 'The Situation in Libya' sounds like an awesome 'Jersey Shore' spin-off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It rained on the LA Marathon yesterday. ... A man from Ethiopia&quot; won the marathon. Second place was earned by a &quot;runner from Kenya. His name was...Barack Obama or something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to be a pain,&quot; but &quot;don't we already have two wars? You know, wars aren't kids, where you don't have to pay attention to the youngest one because the older two will take care of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, Odyssey Dawn? You're really going to name a combat operation after a Yes album?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also -- and this again is not to put too fine a point on this -- but aren't we out of money?! ... You know, you can't simultaneously fire teachers and Tomahawk missiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another...war, and launched on the anniversary of the Iraq War. Is that what you get a war for its anniversary? Another war?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight! The escalating conflict in Libya. Good news, troops. You're getting out of Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as much as I love spreading peace one warhead at a time, President Obama is just blowing this one. He is making the classic Democratic mistake of not being Ronald Reagan. You see, Reagan knew how to launch Libyan air strikes. He did it first and best in 1986, with Operation El Dorado Canyon. ... What is Obama calling this? ... Odyssey Dawn? That's not a military operation. That's a Carnival cruise ship. 'Oh no. Oh no. I have to surrender to America before they threaten me with unlimited shrimp.' Yes, I speak a little Libyan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, no surprise. Qaddafi is not backing down. He told Portuguese television, 'If the world gets crazy with us, we will get crazy, too.' Ladies and gentlemen, Moammar Qaddafi is about to tap into his strategic crazy reserve. I believe that means soon, his moustache is going to start wearing its own sunglasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's in Israel. She visited the Wailing Wall. ... There was an awkward moment when she looked at the wall and said, 'So this is what keeps the Mexicans out?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a test in the new issue of 'Newsweek,' 73% of Americans can't say why we fought the Cold War, which sounds bad, until you realize no one in the White House can explain why we're fighting the Libyan war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, we know more about President Obama's basketball picks than we do about his Libya plan right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you see the footage of France's jet fighters bombing tanks in Libya? God, those planes look brand new. It's like they've almost never been used before. All that French stuff. So shiny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is recovering after fainting while on a trip to Italy. She's fine. ... The good news -- there is no tightness in her chest, just tightness in her face&quot; and &quot;forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin visiting Israel. How about that? As if the Jews have not suffered enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin. And to make her feel at home, she went up in a helicopter and shot a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, someone asked Sarah Palin what she thought about the West Bank, and she said, 'You know, I use Wells Fargo. I don't know anything about them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin canceled her scheduled trip to Bethlehem, which of course is the birthplace of Jesus. See, at the last minute, she realized there was no proof Jesus was actually born there, because he never produced a birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in Chile, to which congresswoman Michele Bachmann said, 'Try their baby back ribs. They're unbelievable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News is now reporting that North Korea is advising its citizens to use their pets as early warning systems for earthquakes. In fact, North Korea's new slogan? 'Poodles. They're not just for dinner anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they're calling this war&quot; in Libya &quot;'Odyssey Dawn. ... And I was thinking, ooh, I know her. That's a different story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's been following March Madness, but it's been a few days without any games. It's been so boring, President Obama said he actually wants to focus on situations in Libya and Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Libya, Moammar Gadhafi is said to be hiding out in a series of underground tunnels. That's basically admitting you're evil, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with the United States' bombing of Libya in our new segment, 'America At Not-War.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like one of the problems we're having with you, Mr. President, is a communications gap. Here in America, we've become accustomed to what's known as the 'run-up to war,'&quot; when the &quot;President and his emissaries make a case for military action or whatever euphemism they've come up with. Freedom seating. Uh, democracy showering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the President's adversaries make their case for why military intervention's a terrible idea, usually in direct opposition to whatever arguments they were making when their party had the presidency and they got to invade stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One problem&quot; that &quot;our military is encountering in Libya is they can't tell pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces apart. So they want the war conducted as shirts versus skins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just announced the official name of the US military action in Libya&quot; is &quot;'Operation Odyssey Dawn.' ... The original title was the much more vague 'Operation Stripper's Name Followed Immediately By Different Stripper's Name.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Donald Trump bragged he once screwed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi on a real estate deal. Then he said, 'You wouldn't believe the piece of crap I unloaded on bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though we are now bombing Libya, according to the Pentagon, US military involvement is limited and has its definite end date. Do you believe that? ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, speaking of -- Germany has pulled its forces out of NATO. ... That's when you know the world is screwed up -- when Germany doesn't want to fight and France does everything's upside down. Okay. The whole world is backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the biggest criticism over Libya is that no one seems to know who's in charge. Because no matter what you thought about George Bush, at least when he was president, you knew who was in charge. Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some bad news today regarding Sarah Palin's trip&quot; to the Middle East. It &quot;looks like she's going to be coming back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Sarah Palin was in Israel, she visited several holy sites, including the Wailing Wall. And she realized&quot; that she had not &quot;sat next to anything that old since the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, while she was in Israel,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;was asked for her solution to the age-old conflict between the Palestinians and the Jewish people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker John Boehner complained that...Obama ordered the US military into combat in Libya without clearly defining the mission to the American people and Congress. See, apparently, you're only allowed to do that when invading Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, exactly 17 days after Newt Gingrich demanded President Obama should establish a no fly zone over Libya,&quot; Gingrich is &quot;now attacking...Obama for imposing&quot; one.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just the Republicans. The Democrats are upset, too. Dennis Kucinich wants to impeach President Obama. Kucinich makes a constitutional argument for that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President's really got his hands full on high unemployment at home here. We've got gas prices skyrocketing. But there is one good thing for the President. His NCAA bracket is looking great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had to use another door to get into the White House yesterday after he got home and the Oval Office was locked. ... When he couldn't get in, Obama was like, 'Holy cow! Is it 2012 already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama sprung into action last night. He called an emergency meeting at 3:00 a.m. to discuss the latest disaster. Not Libya. Duke losing! Obama's brackets are screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an awkward moment for the President this week when he returned to the White House from a South American trip.&quot; He could not &quot;get in because the door was locked. ... At one point, President Obama was so desperate, he got on his cell phone and called Chris Brown to find out the best way to bust out a window.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Obama achieved another campaign promise. Remember two years ago he promised he would unite both parties? ... Well today, both parties are now united against his policy in Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, both sides of the aisle are complaining that the President didn't seek Congress' advice before becoming involved with Libya. You know, the Congress that...put us $14 trillion in debt&quot; and &quot;gave us 10% unemployment. Gee, I can't understand why he didn't consult them for their expert opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moammar Gadhafi has made his first statement this week on the no-fly zone over Libya. He said that in the, 'short term we will beat them, and in the long term we will beat them,&quot; which is Libyan for, 'Bring it. Winning. Bring it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Sri Lanka, a crowd of angry Muslims beat and stomped on an effigy of President Barack Obama during a protest. Muslims versus President Obama. Fox News didn't know&quot; what to &quot;report. They were so confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann is forming a presidential exploratory committee. She said she will launch her campaign in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire, as soon as she figures out which is which.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; there &quot;could be some eligibility problems for...Bachmann. She's got the birth certificate, but nobody can produce her high school diploma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Electric announced it made a profit of $14 billion last year and paid zero in US taxes. How does this make Wesley Snipes feel, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HBO is developing a miniseries about former Vice President Dick Cheney. I think it's called 'Clear!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports coming out that Moammar Gadhafi got hair plugs and face injections 16 years ago. So that's why he looks so good, in case you're wondering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what to make of this. Instead of calling our mission in Libya a 'war,' the White House is calling it 'kinetic military action.' You know, just like that game you played as a kid ? 'one, two, three, four, I declare a thumb kinetic military action.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Joe Biden visited Yankee spring training and said, 'This is what I wanted to do with my life.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, President Obama addressed the nation on Libya. He finally spoke out about it. This changes his previous policy on Libya, which was, of course, 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, so now we have time to talk about Libya, now that all&quot; of Obama's &quot;Final Four picks have been eliminated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's bracket -- busted. None of his picks are going to the Final Four. I mean, the one time he takes quick, decisive action, and look what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Obama had the Jayhawks winning it all. ... What happened to Kansas? Dorothy put up a better fight against the tornado.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be honest. How many thought Gaddafi would be eliminated before Kansas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of calling our mission in Libya a war, the White House is calling it a 'kinetic military action,' which sounds better than 'potential endless quagmire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the wake of record losses, the US Postal Service announced it is cutting 7,500 jobs. But today, a spokesman...says those positions could be restored if this whole e-mail thing turns out to be nothing but a fad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama will be talking about...one of the many wars we're currently involved in. He'll be talking about Libya. And also, he will be talking about why he picked Kansas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama tonight explained his decision to attack Libya and expanded on his plan to bomb Virginia Commonwealth for screwing up his bracket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said the goal of the speech tonight was to update the American people on the situation in Libya, which is great. We appreciate the update, but unfortunately, unless Snooki is going to Libya, the American people don't care that much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be honest. All I know about Libya is that they're the ones who gave Doc Brown the plutonium in 'Back to the Future.' ... And this is how we thank them, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, we are now down to the Final Four -- just four Mideast countries we haven't attacked yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, President Obama spoke to the American people about our role in Libya. I thought it was a good speech. I'm not sure when the war is supposed to end, what happens when we win,&quot; or &quot;how much it's going to cost. But other than that, very informative, I thought. Very informative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said our mission in Libya is clear and focused. You know something? He is such a convincing speaker, I think he almost believes himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is getting criticized from both sides for having no clear exit strategy to get out of Libya. But...neither does Gadhafi. So I think it balances out a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent fundraiser,&quot; a &quot;staffer for Vice President Joe Biden forced a reporter to sit in a storage closet for 90 minutes while waiting to interview the Vice President. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama's speech on Libya was actually scheduled early, so it wouldn't interrupt 'Dancing with the Stars.' That is ridiculous!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Last night, there was another big episode of the show 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... It was preceded by Obama's new show, 'Dancing Around the Objectives in Libya.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics are saying that President Obama seemed defensive and slightly angry during his speech on Libya. Sounds like somebody's March Madness bracket isn't doing so hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, 10 days after we started bombing Libya, President Obama took to the podium to convince Americans that we should bomb Libya, starting ten days ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the reason the President had to talk to us last night is there had been some confusion over what we are doing in Libya.&quot; Initially, &quot;we were told we were helping enforce a no-fly zone. Then we started bombing tanks. ... The no-fly zone became the no-fly zone plus, like a regular no-fly zone only now ground counts as sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is the President's plan for Libya? He better have one, because we'll only put up with this for eight more years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Obama, in coalition with NATO and Arab partners, launched a full-scale...something, on Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Libya is so muddled right now,&quot; a &quot;desperate, desperate sad attempt&quot; was made this week &quot;to clarify what has been called 'Obama's Vietnam' by many of me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's plan involves surrendering America's leadership over to NATO, which is led by Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard, of Canada. Canada!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canada? Great. Great. Instead of a no-fly zone, we'll get a no-fly unless you really want to in case we prefer you didn't but go ahead zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night last night. President Obama made a big speech about Libya. ... The speech was watched by 25 million people. That's right. Sad thing is, it would have been watched by 50 million people if he had sung that 'Friday' song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama reportedly scheduled his speech on Libya last night so it would not interfere with 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... So as of now, the Obama policy is he's willing to embroil us in a third war but not willing to interrupt the Karate Kid's Macarena. I find that worrisome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It took the President nine days to figure out why we're there, and he's running&quot; the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama...took action in Libya, he said, to avoid a slaughter, to which the Kansas Jayhawk said, 'Where were you when we were playing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's critics said he didn't address what they call the 'pottery barn rule' in politics. Have you heard that expression, the 'pottery barn rule'? That means you break it, you bought it. Now don't confuse that with the IKEA rule. No, that's you buy it, you can't assemble it, you get&quot; angry, and &quot;then you break it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, some political watchers believe it was Hillary Clinton who took the lead in Libya, and it was Hillary actually telling the President what to do, to which Bill said, 'Join the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is really passionate about the Middle East. In fact, she told one of her aides that she envisions the day when all women in the Middle East are free to wear pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his latest speech, Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich said he is worried that America will soon become an atheist country, potentially dominated by radical Islamists. That's right, our big problem could be religious atheists. And those people are almost as bad as pacifist war mongers. And let me tell you something, if they join forces with the communist capitalists, we are screwed...as a nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Supreme Court heard arguments in a lawsuit where one and a half million female employees are suing Wal-Mart, claiming the company favors men over women and pay the women less.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may have to shut down the government because of...no budget. That's crazy, isn't it? ... I mean, this is serious. We may have to suspend all three of these wars.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll know...the government&quot; has officially closed &quot;when John Boehner's face goes from orange to red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said that President Obama will not focus on full-time campaigning for a long time. ... He wants to wait a year or two before he gets serious about it, just like he did with being president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a semi-secret $376 million construction project going on at the White House right now. The official word is they're updating underground heating systems, but there are reports that they are building a mysterious tunnel. Poor Obama. That's a lot of work just to get away from your mother-in-law. Let the man have a cigarette already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's a lot of speculation&quot; about &quot;what the tunnel's purpose is. ... Personally, I believe he's building an underground Kenya, a new subterranean land, so he can Africanize us from below. I heard that on Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you've been following the news from our nation's capital you know that construction near the Dupont Circle has constricted traffic near the northwest New Hampshire Avenue entrance. Okay, maybe that's too local. But, also, the Federal government appears to be closing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will close this Friday because the Congress and our President can't agree on a budget. The Republicans, having rediscovered fiscal restraint, would like to slash $61 billion from the budget. Whereas the Democrats are standing up firmly for their vision of government's efficacy and the value of many of these spending programs. I'm sorry, I was supposed to say the Democrats have agreed to cut $33 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the 2012 election is only 18 months away. And on Monday, Barack Obama finally officially threw his turban into the ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, obviously, Republicans want to take back the White House. But so far, the field looks like a turnout from a Craigslist ad for a free couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are saying that if Republicans and Democrats don't reach agreement own the budget by Friday, the government could stop working. I thought it stopped working for eight years when George Bush was president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government shutdown happens, there will be a dramatic slow-down in public services. The mail will take longer. Garbage won't be picked up. D.M.V., same. ... 'Am I in the wrong line? I have been standing here for three days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama invited key Republicans and Democrats to the White House to get them to try to reach an agreement by Friday. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of today, it looks like we're heading for a government shutdown. ... Well, you thought Joe Biden had nothing do before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine the entire government shutting down. I mean, without the government, who would not inspect our airplanes? Who would fail to secure our borders? Who would put us $14 trillion in debt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the best part about this government&quot; shutdown: Members of &quot;Congress will still get paid. Nobody else will, but they will. ... We'll be paying them to do nothing. It will be exactly like it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; do &quot;you know the most embarrassing part about this? By the weekend, our government could be shut down, but Gadhafi's government&quot; might still be &quot;going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it has been a week of mixed emotions for President Obama. He hasn't been able to get Moammar Gadhafi out of Libya, but today, he achieved his second objective, getting Glenn Beck off of Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason Glenn Beck is leaving Fox? The network is just too...liberal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beck &quot;says he wants to go to a channel that's a better fit for him, like the Cartoon Network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, working 11 hours a day can increase your risk of heart attack by 67%. See, this is part of Obama's healthcare plan. You keep those unemployment figures up. He's protecting our health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Obama announced he's going to seek re-election in 2012. His new slogan? 'Change you can believe in this time. I promise. Really. I'm telling you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten President Obama Campaign Promises For 2012:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Be more of a warlock, less of a troll.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Keep unemployment below 75%.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Fight three wars and the fourth one is free.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Replace space shuttle with' footage of comedian Don Rickles firing a rocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Get fat like the rest of America.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Send troops to quell feud between Meat Loaf and Gary Busey.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Fortune cookies actually tell fortunes. No more of this lucky numbers crap.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Less talk, more rock.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Pardon Lindsay Lohan.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Go back to being that cool' smoker everyone 'fell in love with.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama announced that he was running for a second term as President of the United States. There's a brand new campaign slogan ? 'Give me four more years to find my birth certificate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out the White House might have to lay off staff members if the government shuts down on Friday. It's really bad news for non-essential workers. You know, interns, pages, Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are a mess in Washington. Yesterday, President Obama said he doesn't have time for games with Republicans on a budget deal. This is bad news for that new video game, Wii Budget Deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with our ongoing coverage of 'America at Not-War.' In Libya, America's assistance appears to be paying dividends as reports indicate that the rebels, bolstered by NATO air power, have taken six coastal cities. What's that? Oh, sorry. I'm being told they've taken the same city six times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, people, we are now into our third week of a military bombing campaign in Libya, 'Operation Odyssey Dawn,' the operation cleverly named for 'The Odyssey,' a 20-year harrowing journey through a hellscape where nearly everyone is killed, adding 'Dawn,' so it's the earliest part of that day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the budget impasse, the Federal government&quot; could be &quot;shut down by the end of the week. That's right. There will be another season of 'Jersey Shore' but the US government? Still up in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the government does shut down, it means the national parks will be closed. On the bright side, that means&quot; there will not be a &quot;sequel to that Yogi Bear movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like our government could seriously shut down this Friday, which means to me one thing: We don't ever have to pay taxes again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Democrats and Republicans can't reach an agreement&quot; by Friday, &quot;all non-essential Federal employees will be sent home. Now, somebody is going to have to tell Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Barack Obama told Republicans and Democrats they have to work together and start acting like grown-ups. Speaker of the House John Boehner said, 'Obama, your mama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama announced he is going to host his first town hall re-election meeting on Facebook. ... He is going to answer questions for an hour, and if it gets too serious, he is going to show the video of the two babies talking to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow the big threat of that government shutdown. ... A lot of people wonder what...a government shutdown would be like.&quot; But &quot;more people wonder what a government running properly would be like.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Boehner, Speaker of the House,&quot; is &quot;not backing down one bit. He says he will cry all through the weekend if he has to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today that Americans are just going to have to get used to higher gas prices,&quot; to &quot;which Dick Cheney said, 'That's change I can believe in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, President Obama revealed that up until a few years ago, he was still paying off his student loans. ... In response, China was like, 'Oh, so you do know how to repay loans. Interesting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It threw me for a loop&quot; when Glenn Beck announced he will be leaving Fox News.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we knew that &quot; Beck &quot;wouldn't be with us forever, like a beautiful and bold hot house flower, or mononucleosis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's a government shutdown, 800,000 Federal workers could get a phone call tomorrow telling them they are non-essential.&quot; The same number of people are &quot;getting the exact same call from my dad every morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many are upset about the idea of government shutdown? ... How many more are upset because Pia got voted off 'American Idol'? ... There's your problem. You get the government you deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if&quot; the government &quot;does shut down, Washington says they will also close museums, monuments,&quot; and &quot;parks, like the Grand Canyon. I mean, how do you close the Grand Canyon? Do you fill in the hole?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, do you walk around the park chasing the coyotes? 'Let's go! Party's over! Come on! Out of the park! Let's go! ... Lock it up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if the government shuts down, senior citizens will still get their Social Security checks, but no one will be around to answer their questions about benefits. So, it'll be pretty much business as usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some exciting news. The Bravo network has cancelled the show 'Real Housewives of Washington DC.' Finally, a government shutdown we can feel good about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, a deal was reached to keep the government running. So the good news is, the government is up and running same as before. The bad news? The government is up and running same as before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This proves that if both sides just&quot; abandon &quot;all their principles, things can get done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new poll out today shows that only 19% of Americans strongly approve of Obama's performance. The other 81% don't own gas stations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said in an interview over the weekend, he misses being anonymous. ... Hey, be careful what you wish for: 2012 is just around the corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Obama wanted &quot;to remain anonymous,&quot; he &quot;should have run for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump said today he will not decide about a possible run for the presidency until after the current season of 'Celebrity Apprentice' wraps up. So, say what you want about Donald. At least he has his priorities in order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump says he has sent investigators to Hawaii to look into President Obama's birth record. ... I'm sure those investigators aren't playing Trump. 'Yeah, listen. We're going to need a couple more weeks in Maui. Yeah, yeah, there's evidence all over the place. We're gonna...look at some of the clubs tonight and see what we can come up with.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano wants to use Twitter to tell people about terrorist warnings. Come on. Are people going to take a bomb threat warning from twitter seriously? 'OMG TNT.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day down there in Washington&quot; today. It was so nice, in fact, that &quot;President Obama was fanning himself with his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the government didn't shut down. .... So Americans are getting exactly what they want -- slashing of Medicare and Social Security. Winning!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with news out of Washington. The Federal government is open. ... How did Congress get to a place where they were going to shut the entire Federal government down due to a dispute over .19 percent of the budget? ... Democrats put off writing a budget because they were afraid that talking about spending might lose them the House of Representatives, a strategy that, as we all know, worked out very -- oh, right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I almost didn't come to work today, folks. I am just...so depressed that we still have a government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I even got up early on Saturday morning to listen for the closings&quot; but heard none. What &quot;a gyp! Now I'll never get to sled down a hill of unemployed Federal workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With no government, we could finally have shaken off the yolk of useless regulatory agencies like the EPA. And I was even ready to toast the lack of industrial oversight with&quot; a &quot;champagne flute of lead paint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that Congress has overcome their differences and found a way to compromise, we can move on to the more important question -- who won? .... Folks, I am afraid the winner might actually be Barack Obama. He is certainly acting like it. He took a victory lap at the Lincoln Memorial. ... It's the defining moment of his Presidency. He went to the Lincoln Memorial, which has no doors, and celebrated it being open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he hopes there's more of this kind of cooperation. And that's delivering on his campaign slogan: 'I hope to make the government just functional enough to keep the Lincoln Memorial open.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To avoid a shutdown, the government cut $39 billion from the Federal budget. ... The good news -- the first thing to go was 'The Real Housewives of DC.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, I guess, is starting to confess to some of his anxieties. In a recent interview, President Obama said, 'I miss being anonymous.' ... He said, 'In the old days, I could blend in with all the other Hawaiian Barack Hussein Obamas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a news conference today, Hillary Clinton said the ousting of Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo sends a message to other dictators. ... And that message is, 'If we can't pronounce your name, you're toast. That's our new policy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon made a big announcement. The Pentagon announced openly gay soldiers will begin serving this summer.&quot; Some people asked &quot;'Why this summer?' The Army said, 'Because 'Glee' will be in reruns.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the government is still open. They reached an agreement. ... Saturday morning, President Obama visited the Lincoln Memorial to show everybody that it was open. ... President Obama at the Lincoln Memorial. I am surprised that Donald Trump doesn't want to see Abraham Lincoln's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Fox News,&quot; Eric Cantor &quot;said the Republicans want to cut Medicaid funding for the poor so they can learn to do more with less while also cutting taxes for the rich. See, this way the poor would have to learn to do more with less and the rich would have to learn to do more with more. That seems fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the Federal Trade Commission, for the 11th year in a row, the number one consumer complaint&quot; is &quot;identity theft. And today, President Obama said, 'This is why you should never show anyone your birth certificate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders are saying that Donald Trump is running for president as a publicity stunt. Hey! Whoa! Hold it! Hey! Hey! Hold it right there. That's not the Donald Trump I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow afternoon, President Barack Obama will give a major speech unveiling his long-term deficit reduction plan. So you know what that means? Deficit reduction plan viewing party! Yo, yo! Let's get some spreadsheets&quot; and &quot;some guacamole. ... It's on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's speech follows the release of the Republican deficit plan authored by Wisconsin dream boat -- I mean Congressman -- Paul Ryan.&quot; He is the &quot;Hunk Budget Committee -- I mean, House Budget Committee -- chairman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According a new CNN poll,&quot; potential &quot;presidential candidate Donald Trump has nearly doubled his support since March. ... Although technically, all he did was comb his March numbers over his current ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't believe this story, but it was reported that Muammar Gaddafi once wrote a children's book. ... It's called 'Horton Hears Voices In His Head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that Ivory Coast dictator Laurent Gbagbo was driven from power due to concerted military action by the French. No one was more surprised to hear this than the French. They've never had this feeling before. 'Someone run away from us?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are watching at home, Donald Trump, this show is made in America, seen by Americans, and hosted by an American. I don't have my birth certificate. I share it with my cousin Omar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a CNN poll that says that Donald Trump is in first place for the Republican nomination. You know who's happy? Barack Obama. He is like, 'Me and that fool? I win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if&quot; Trump &quot;wins, it is going to be by a hair&quot; -- a &quot;long one, curled up so that it looks like a nest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump said he will not make an official announcement about running for president until Celebrity Apprentice' is over. I never thought I would say this, but I hope that...show lasts forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump is saying that Americans want to see Barack Obama's birth certificate. I'm not so crazy about seeing it. What I want to see is a celebrity on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' Even La Toya Jackson says, 'They want me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one part of President Obama's plan I thought was very interesting. He's calling on all Americans to have more grandchildren. ... Because the more of them there are, the easier it will be for them to pay off our $14 trillion debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The New York Times' is reporting -- listen to this -- the relationship now between the United States and Pakistan is strained. Gee, I'm shocked.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the big Easter Egg Roll&quot; at the White House. Things were a little &quot;different this year,&quot; because &quot;every time one of the kids would find an egg, First Lady Michelle Obama would make them trade it in for a low-cholesterol egg beater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who&quot; painted the &quot;eggs for today's White House Easter Egg Roll? ... This is true. Ex-cons. ... So it's nice to see the White House reaching out to former members of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump told 'Fox &amp; Friends' he is being attacked by the White House because he's President Obama's worst nightmare. ... Do you think that's true? Nah. Having to make a decision. That's President Obama's worst nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York City Board of Elections says Trump hasn't voted in a primary election in 21 years. ... Well, of course he hasn't voted in 21 years. His name wasn't on the ballot!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next thing they'll be telling us&quot; is that Trump &quot;likes to hear himself talk. How ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about that tornado&quot; that &quot;ripped through&quot; an airport in St. Louis. Here is the &quot;amazing part, though -- air traffic controllers slept right through it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of high gas prices here&quot; in California, &quot;a lot of Americans are now driving across the border into Mexico and filling up with cheap Mexican gas, then driving back.&quot; The &quot;downside&quot; is that &quot;your car may get riddled with machine gun bullets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does that say about the American economy, when Americans are sneaking into Mexico for a better way of life? ... It's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, Tax Day was last week. And once again, Barack Obama proved he is a pro-tax liberal by paying his taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he made his return public and there are some disturbing revelations, folks. Firstly, Barack Obama listed his occupation as US President, and Michelle's occupation as US First Lady. That is bald nepotism. She would never have gotten that job if she weren't married to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, they both checked the box to have $3 of their taxes go to the presidential election campaign. Let's see, let's see.&quot; Who is &quot;running are for president next year? Oh, that's right. Barack Obama. Now he's six bucks richer. That is the perfect money laundering scheme, in that it's enough money to do a load of laundry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now clearly, folks,&quot; a &quot;strong Republican candidate&quot; is needed &quot;to take Obama down. But who's it going to be? Now, usually I choose the guy I would want to have a beer with. But by that standard,&quot; a couple of &quot;Republicans have some drawbacks. Mitt Romney is a Mormon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there is one guy out there who really excites me. Donald Trump. This guy...thinks outside the box. Can you name one other candidate who could make a casino go bankrupt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is all over the place these days. But I have held off talking about him because I was afraid this was all just a publicity stunt.

That's why we don't tax them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new Zogby poll shows that President Obama's job approval rating among likely voters has dropped to 41%. Not good. In fact, a lot of people who voted for him now say they liked him a lot better when he was a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an interview on ABC News, Speaker of the House John Boehner said that President Obama needs to 'grow up.' And then he burst into tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, the President released his long-form birth certificate, proving once and for all, he was born in the country. But you know, it never ends. Now Republican leaders are saying they want to see the placenta.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump today said, 'I am very proud of myself, because I accomplished something no one else was able to accomplish.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after releasing the birth certificate today, the President said there's work to be done.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington,&quot; it was a &quot;beautiful lovely sunny spring day&quot; today. It &quot;was so nice down in Washington that President Obama was out on the White House lawn, making a kite out of his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting&quot; because when you look at Obama's birth certificate, you see that his &quot;full name...is&quot; Barack, which we knew, &quot;Hussein Cougar Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to recent polls, 50% of Americans think Donald Trump would make a terrible president. ... The other 50% think he would make an awful president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama released his birth certificate today, proving once and for all that he was born in the United States. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama finally broke down and showed everyone his birth certificate. And you're not going to believe this. It turns out&quot; that his mother's first name is Stanley. No &quot;wonder she rebelled and had a Kenyan baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has released a copy of his long-form birth certificate. I repeat, for those just tuning in, the current President of the United States, who after being born in the United States and becoming that country's president, has released the non-legally required version of the legally required birth certificate he had previously released.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, at 9:02 East Coast Elitist Time, Barack Obama released a copy of his long-form birth certificate, sending 24-hour news organizations into&quot; a &quot;news-eleptic seizure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How did our cooler, funner president,&quot; Donald Trump, &quot;react? Well...he choppered into his own press conference aboard Trump Force One, a helicopter with his name on it in giant letters, because I guess he loses it a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a lot of fun today,&quot; which was Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work Day. That has &quot;got to be tough for Joe Biden, trying to explain to the kids what the vice president does, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, President Obama's approval rating has dipped to its lowest level ever. In fact, it's so bad, people in Kenya are now thrilled to find out he was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama finally released his official birth certificate. And now, the tables have turned. Today, Obama has demanded Donald Trump not only produce a birth certificate but the actual silver spoon he was born with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump is now taking credit for Obama showing the birth certificate. This is his quote. He said, 'I've been able to accomplish something no one else has been able to accomplish.' That's right. He has now become even more annoying than Sarah Palin. It's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump...doesn't give up. Now he's demanding to see President Obama's school record. ... Trump says he wants to know how Obama got into Harvard. How Obama got into Harvard? We can't even figure out how George Bush got into Harvard. ... Let's start with that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was&quot; recently announced that &quot;Keith Olbermann's new show will start in June on the Al Gore network, Current TV. Well, they call it the Al Gore network, but apparently, Al is the only one watching it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Mexican soap opera star accused of entering a sham marriage so she could stay in the United States has just been sentenced to 30 days in jail. See, unfortunately, she didn't know you could just sneak into the country and stay as long as you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump&quot; now &quot;says he's proud of himself for getting Barack Obama to reveal his birth certificate. Winning, hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Trump was in New Hampshire, you know, where they have the presidential...primaries. And he was testing the waters up there, to see if the country is ready for a buffoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump said he'll announce whether he's running for president or not on the final episode of 'Celebrity Apprentice.' He'll be surrounded by other political heavyweights -- Gary Busey, La Toya Jackson, and Meat Loaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not unusual for a candidate to announce their candidacy on a television program. Remember George W. Bush announced that he was going to run when he was on 'Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader'? Remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with the astonishingly ongoing fallout from yesterday's release of President Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate, proving thrice and for all that the President was, in fact, born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cable news reaction was mixed. MSNBC took the opportunity to do a victory lap,&quot; while &quot;Fox News took the opportunity to say, 'We fold you so, except for all the times we told you not so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In America, our Department of Homeland Security teaches us&quot; that &quot;when are you traveling, if you see something, say something. That's why when I go to the airport I'm constantly saying everything I see. 'Luggage. Woman. Cinnabon. Scared man in bathroom mirror.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why I have always loved the Homeland Security's color coded terror alert system. It is the only rainbow that has not been ruined by the gays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was so shocked then to hear...from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano,&quot; who announced the elimination of the 'old color code system.' What?! ... But without&quot; the &quot;bright colors, how will I know what flavor my fear is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what is Homeland Security's replacement for the Sherman Williams paint swatches of doom? ... Elevated and imminent&quot; will be the only two threat levels. Why &quot;not throw in...lugubrious? ... I didn't know I had to ace the SATs to know the appropriate time to crap my pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new system will also allow you to sign up for terror alerts via email, Facebook, and Twitter. Great. I can't wait to receive a tweet that the Department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level because of evidence that a terrorist plot is about to happen in the city of -- oh no! Too many characters! What city?! Is it New York?! Tell me, terror tweet, tell me!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, many Americans say they're disappointed the media is paying so much attention to the ridiculous statements being made by Donald Trump.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some good news today for Donald Trump. He got an endorsement from former child star Joey Lawrence,&quot; who &quot;says he's hoping to vote for...Trump. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news? Osama bin Laden is dead. The bad news? There is no bad news. Osama bin Laden is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, last night, President Obama announced that Osama bin Laden has been killed by a group of highly trained navy SEALs. Even Sarah Palin was amazed. She said, 'Look, I've seen them at Sea World playing the trumpets and balancing a ball, but I had no idea they had this kind of skill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain...hasn't been this excited since they killed John Wilkes Booth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, bin Laden was killed in his mansion. Actually, this whole plan went into effect last August. See, what happened was I guess bin Laden got behind in his payments and the bank turned him in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they went right into his mansion and killed him. And a related story. Today, Donald Trump sold his mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, before they made the announcement, the White House wanted to be absolutely certain it was bin Laden. In fact, you know who they brought in to do the DNA test? Maury Povich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it turns out bin Laden was shot twice in the face, so it looks like Dick Cheney may have been involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince William&quot; and Kate Middleton are &quot;now planning their honeymoon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'I'm not sure I want to live in a world where 'Fast Five' is the number one movie.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks enjoy the Osama bin Laden season finale?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we finally killed bin Laden. Boy, that didn't take long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA, these guys know what they are doing. They got into the compound. They had a guy posing as the Domino's kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those Navy SEALs? ... We're getting our money's worth out of those guys, aren't we? They jump out of a helicopter and they break&quot; into bin Laden's &quot;compound and they fire a warning shot in his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has already been some trouble for Osama bin Laden in the afterlife.&quot; It is the kind of &quot;mix-up that happens all the time. Just a paperwork kind of a deal. He was greeted by 72 vegans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is bin Laden lived long enough to see the royal wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden was killed by US forces. Everyone on TV has been happy all day. Glenn Beck was even crying. Then he found out we got Osama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The media has been going crazy with this. On the left, MSNBC said, 'President Obama saves world.' On the right, Fox News said, 'President Obama kills fellow Muslim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama must be very happy. He finally took down his archenemy,&quot; when he interrupted Donald Trump's &quot;Celebrity Apprentice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the next election just got a lot easier for President Obama, because his response to every question during debates will be , 'Wait, I forget. Did you kill Osama bin Laden? Oh, no, it was me, wasn't it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, man, if you were watching 'Celebrity Apprentice' last night, it was just crazy. I mean, I didn't see it, but, apparently, Star Jones and NeNe Leakes got so out of control, they ended up killing Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced late last night that bin Laden has been killed in Pakistan. .. Bin Laden is dead, just like the Republicans' chances in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama announced last night that bin Laden was killed. And, oddly enough, bin Laden's last words were, 'I hope you at least use this to interrupt 'Celebrity Apprentice.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden was killed by US forces in an upscale suburb of Pakistan. Even worse for bin Laden, turns out his 72 virgins were just some dudes watching 'Game of Thrones' on HBO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US said that bin Laden was actually buried out at sea. ... Man, what a tough year for the ocean, huh? ... First BP pumps oil into it, then radiation seeps in from Japan, now we're like, 'Hey, do you mind? We're going to put Osama bin Laden in there.' ... Why do we hate the ocean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After bin Laden was killed, the FBI updated its most wanted list. So, on behalf of everyone here, I just would like to congratulate Lindsay Lohan on her recent promotion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, on CNN, Donald Trump insisted that he's not a racist and said he has 'many, many black friends.' Because when you want to prove you're not racist, say the one thing racist people always say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like us to kill Osama bin Laden every Sunday night. It makes for a much brighter start to the week for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all the talk about caves,&quot; bin Laden &quot;turned out to be hiding&quot; in a &quot;million dollar mansion in Pakistan. The CIA became suspicious when they learned there was a million dollar mansion in Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want to point out, buried at sea means dumped in the ocean. ... They dumped&quot; bin Laden &quot;in the ocean. ... This could be the best 'Shark Week' ever if they find that&quot; body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, I should point out that on the same night Obama was ordering the Navy to kill Osama bin Laden, his potential opponent in 2012, Donald Trump, was busy firing Playmate of the Month Hope Dworaczyk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our guest tonight Philip K. Howard is filling in for our...originally scheduled guest, Osama bin Laden, who is... At the time, we thought it was a pretty special booking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you how I heard the news of Osama bin Laden's demise.&quot; It happened when &quot;I'm watching 'Celebrity Apprentice'&quot; to &quot;see if Obama and Seth Meyers' absolute shellacking of Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday had left a visible mark. I'm watching this 'Apprentice' episode, even though the episode had been taped prior to the correspondents' dinner. The demolition of Trump at the correspondents' dinner was so thorough, I thought it might actually supersede the rules of dimensional time and space and leave a mark on future episodes of the 'Apprentice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So &quot;we kill bin Laden...in Abbottabad. It sounds like the name most New Yorkers would have invented for the fictional place they would have loved to kill bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they &quot;just threw him off a boat.&quot; Did &quot;we at least&quot; consider &quot;carbonite? Put it up in the West Wing, do a little wall hanging or something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose I should be expressing some ambivalence about the targeted killing of another human being and yet, no. I just want details. What look did he give when bin Laden realized that the helicopters overhead were not giving traffic and weather updates?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, believe me, he wasn't expecting it. You know, he was living in some upscale Pakistani suburb for some time when we got him.&quot; He was &quot;preaching suicide bombings and jihad, pretending he's Gandalf wandering the frontier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bin Laden's &quot;death raises many questions. For instance, does Moammar Qaddafi own a pair of bulletproof Ray-Bans? And does this mean we can finally bring our troops home from Afghanistan? And by home, of course, I mean Libya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Hamid Karzai says bin Laden's death proves Afghanistan isn't the center of terrorism. He wants American troops to leave&quot; his &quot;country alone so they can return to their peaceful tradition of producing the world's finest heroin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama gave the order for Osama bin Laden to be killed by Navy SEALs. ...When he heard about it, former President Bush was furious, and he said, 'Wait a minute, I could have used seals?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden was hiding in a compound with several people, including his personal assistant. ... Apparently, bin Laden's last words were 'cancel my two o'clock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Obama has done something that no one else has been able to do. He got Donald Trump to shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are looking pretty good for the President this week. Osama bin Laden is gone, his poll numbers are up, and you can tell Obama's starting to feel a little cocky. ... Like, today, he held a press conference and said, 'Yeah, I was born in Kenya. What are you going to do about it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are celebrating all over the country. In fact, the hot new drink at bars is the bin Laden. Have you had one of these? It's a Colt 45 and a shot that goes right to your head.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is the latest on bin Laden. He's left this world. He's now at SeaWorld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shot him in the head and then they dumped his body in the ocean. I mean, who did this hit? The Navy SEALs or the Sopranos?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House said they might not release Osama bin Laden's death photos because they say they are too gruesome. Well they have to say that, don't they? What are they going to say? 'They're awesome! Yes!' They can't say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein is dead, Osama bin Laden is dead. If you're Moammar Gadhafi, that living in exile thing is starting to look pretty good right about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, NATO bombed Gadhafi's compound in Tripoli. The bombing apparently devastated countless antique rugs and curtains, leaving Gadhafi with absolutely nothing to wear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overhead As President Obama And Top Members Of His Administration Watched The Osama Bin Laden Raid:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'We have got to get together for covert special ops raids more often.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Are we shooting this in the studio where we faked the moon landing?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Someone run to the store and get daddy a pack of smokes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Hit pause, I gotta take a leak?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'These vibrating chairs are the best money we ever spent.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Biden, wake up!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Mind if we switch over to the Celtics game for a second?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'We should totally post this on YouTube.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Seriously, Joe, wake up!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'I just wish Dick Cheney were alive to see this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Osama bin Laden? Everybody's still talking about that. ... I got together today with a group of clergymen and they told me that just about now he should be arriving in hell. And I said, 'Really.' They said, 'Yeah, but it's a dry heat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bin Laden had been living in a &quot;private compound with all of his wives for the last six years. So he did suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republicans&quot; were so pleased by the Osama bin Laden raid that today, they granted President Obama &quot;full citizenship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's another bad day for Osama bin Laden.&quot; Not &quot;only is he dead,&quot; now his computer has been &quot;confiscated. Apparently, his computer was removed and taken away&quot; and it snow being examined by the CIA. But they have &quot;had a difficult time figuring out his password. Five letters, blank 'to America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House opened a new round of budget talks this week with members of Congress. I bet those talks are easier now. It's like, 'I want my budget. You want yours. There's only one way to settle this. Raise your hand if you found and killed Osama bin Laden. Anyone? Oh yeah, that was me, so my budget it is. Yeah, thanks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh said yesterday that Obama never would have tracked down bin Laden if it wasn't for George W. Bush's policies. Although, in fairness, Obama never would have never been elected if it weren't for George W. Bush's policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, in the wake of bin Laden's death, the NBA has announced that it will use metal detectors at all playoff games to screen for weapons. Or, as the players put it, 'Uh-oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're here on a very good night. Anthony Hopkins is here. ... Bin laden is not here. He's dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President and his staff watched the operation unfold on video, live from the White House Situation Room. Isn't it sad&quot; that &quot;every time I hear the word&quot; situation, &quot;I think of 'Jersey Shore'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one &quot;point during the viewing, Vice President Biden asked them to pause it so he could go to the bathroom. They had to explain it wasn't on TiVo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We turn to our continuing coverage&quot; of the &quot;demise of Osama bin Laden.&quot; A &quot;nagging question in my mind concerns Pakistan, the country whose suburb of Abbottabad has been home to bin Laden for apparently the last six years. And, you know, Pakistan was last year's honored recipient of the United States' $3.2 billion 'Be Our Friend Please' scholarship, awarded each year to the country that if we didn't give them $3.2 billion would in no way be our friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden&quot; had been living a &quot;half a mile from Pakistan's version of West Point, in a town surrounded by retired ex-military officers. A half mile. Look at that in New York City terms. Bin Laden was on 21st and 7th Avenue. They were on 21st and 9th Avenue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Pakistani military academy were Domino's, they would deliver to bin Laden on foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hunt&quot; for Osama bin Laden &quot;was like finding a needle in a country that swore it did not have needles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to release the Osama bin Laden death photo. They're doing so on a set of limited edition commemorative plates. ... I would take it on a mouse pad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his radio show yesterday, Rush Limbaugh declared, 'Thank God for President Obama.' In other words, ladies and gentlemen, the apocalypse has begun. That's one of the signs. That and then locusts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this guy in the paper today? A drunk, 61-year-old man from Yonkers, New York,&quot; while speaking to &quot;an Air France traffic ticket agent&quot; at JFK Airport, &quot;says, 'My name is bin Laden and I have a bomb in my bag.' Of course, the airlines took swift action&quot; by seizing his bag and charging &quot;him 35 bucks &quot; to have it checked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They knew right away it wasn't the real bin Laden, because he wasn't being protected by the Pakistan military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're getting more and more details about this amazing raid on bin Laden's house.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, bin Laden was buried at sea. ... Dick Cheney calls that 'the ultimate waterboarding.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden said he was amazed and impressed at the number of people who were told about the mission, and that it was never leaked. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning flip-flop, the White House says now it will not release the photo of bin Laden.&quot; Instead, the White House will wait &quot;until Donald Trump forces them to release it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although they are not releasing the photo of bin Laden, today they released his last words. He said, 'Don't tase me, bro!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. No one gave better hugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Did shirtless Tai Chi in the yard ? you're welcome, ladies!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. He did a lot of volunteer work at the JCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Very quiet, except on rare occasions when Navy SEALs would raid his house and kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Having a celebrity in the neighborhood is always good for property values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. .Olympic-sized camel-shaped pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The adorable way he'd shout 'Death to weeds!' when mowing the lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. At barbecues he made his famous 'Fatwa Franks.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. You were never the biggest ******* in the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time of his death,&quot; Osama bin Laden &quot;was found to have sewn the equivalent of $740 into his clothing. ... Experts say his next plan was to launch a major attack, or rent a one-bedroom apartment in Chicago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marijuana plants have been found near the compound of Osama bin Laden,&quot; which &quot;may explain why his last&quot; word was &quot;dude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been revealed that the Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden were accompanied by a bomb-sniffing, armor-wearing, German shepherd.&quot; The dog &quot;said the 'mission was okay,' but he was 'really hoping bin Laden had a cat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House&quot; is &quot;releasing more and more information on the details of that attack on Osama bin Laden by the SEALs. Today, they informed the press...the helicopters were able to get in there without being noticed. Pretty cool. They said that helicopters were able to fly in undetected because it was 1:00 a.m. and the Pakistan air traffic controller was sound asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said bin Laden's wife tried to shield bin Laden with her body. ... And today, Moammar Gadhafi said to his wife, 'Hey honey, did you see what bin Laden's wife...did? ... That was pretty cool, don't you think, honey?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, bin Laden's body&quot; is &quot;now in the ocean. How ironic was that? Once again, surrounded by seals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says there is no chance of them releasing the bin Laden death photos, unless, of course, the President starts to drop in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people now that believe Osama bin Laden has been dead for years&quot; and that the &quot;whole raid was staged after Obama released his birth certificate. People believe that,&quot; and &quot;by people, I of course mean patients.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dislocated his shoulder...after his hand slipped on a parked car he was leaning on. So watch out, al Qaeda!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about Osama bin Laden. Hillary Clinton said that watching the raid on bin Laden's compound was 38 of the most intense minutes, which can only mean&quot; she has &quot;never had to assemble a chair from IKEA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that officials in Pakistan found marijuana plants on Osama bin Laden's property, which explains why he was like, 'We must defeat America. And while we're there, someone needs to stock up on those pizza flavored goldfish, because I'm, like, jonesing for those, bro. They're so tasty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going to host a poetry night at the White House next week. Obama will recite some Yeats, Hillary will recite some Frost,&quot; and &quot;Biden will recite some Seuss.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, for the second year in the row, Jacob and Isabella are the most popular baby names in the US. The least most popular baby name? Donald Sheen bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news from the Republican presidential race ? a debate in South Carolina tonight will pit Tim Pawlenty against Ron Paul, in a contest to determine once and for all who will come in fourth in the Republican primaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absent from the debate -- front-runners Donald Trump and Sarah Palin, the Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr of the Republican field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I got to tell you, when we shot&quot; Osama bin Laden &quot;in the face, I was as excited as the next guy, unless the next guy was bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But enough. We get it! President Obama is awesome. He's a gutsy leader who killed bin Laden. I don't like this new Obama, who hunts Muslim extremists. I liked the old Obama, who is a Muslim extremist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, right now, this very evening in Columbia, South Carolina, they are holding the inaugural Republican presidential debate, sponsored and broadcast on Fox News, because for the first time in its history, C-SPAN had something better to film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the candidates responded to Fox's call. Mitt Romney said, 'I couldn't be there.' Sarah Palin opted out. Newt Gingrich stopped answering his phone. Mike Huckabee, who has a show on Fox News, declined Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily,&quot; the Republicans &quot;have a deep bench -- Mitch Daniels, John Huntsman, and Michelle Bachman, who also said no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I cannot wait to get home to watch it because this debate has everything you tune in for -- podiums, microphones, and elevated platforms,&quot; plus &quot;lights so you can see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of -- big dilemma for a lot of folks this Mother's Day. I mean, you go to the ATM and take $200 out for the dozen roses or do you take $200 and fill the SUV with gas to drive the 50 miles to see...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, some good news. The price of oil dropped 12% this week. It is now $100 a barrel. Yeah. And they say -That's good news. The oil companies say they should be passing these savings on to us in six or seven years. So we should see a drop by one tenth of one hundredth of a percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, new claims of unemployment benefits jumped by 43,000 last week. The highest level in eight months. And to offset the bad news, today President Obama ordered the Navy to fish out Bin Laden's body and shoot it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden's wife who was taken into custody after the raid told authorities that she hadn't been out of the house in five years. So I guess it's pretty clear who tipped us off, huh? You never take me anywhere! You know it was her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the news today? Because of the killing of Bin Laden they've started burning American flags again. It was all over the news today. Here's my question. Where are they buying all these American flags in Pakistan? Do you know any place here you can get a Pakistani flag? No. But every Pakistani house seems to have an emergency American flag just for burning. You know, you break the glass, you take it down, you go march with it, you walk around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just came out today, supporters of Osama Bin Laden say they want to rename the Arabian Sea where Bin Laden's body was dumped. They want to call it Martyr Sea. Please. Hiding in your bedroom with blinds closed for six years, without going out. How about chicken-of-the sea? Why don't we call it that? Let's call it chicken-of-the sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and this is -- and then, this is my favorite thing. In an address at USC the other day, the Dalai Lama seemed to suggest that killing Bin Laden was okay. See, that's when you know you're a bad guy. When the Dalai Lama is going, 'I didn't see nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Gadhafi to leave power. She sent him a sealed note. You know, if you want to scare Gadhafi, don't send him a sealed note. Send him a note delivered by a Navy SEAL. That's how you have to do these things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Donald Trump says he will now not drive the pace car for this year's Indy 500. He was supposed to drive it. Yeah. Apparently got some disturbing news about the car. Turns out it's a convertible. Yeah. Yes, so he's not gonna do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, of course -- as you know, Donald Trump still furious with President Obama. Oh God. You know, 'cause killing Bin Laden, that was supposed to be the final task on 'Celebrity Apprentice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, of course, was Cinco de Mayo. In fact in Mexico people were so drunk, they were sneaking into Guatemala. That's how bad -- They were actually going the wrong ? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cinco de Mayo. The Mexicans celebrate Cinco de Mayo, and the Americans celebrate Uno de Mayo, Uno de Mayo. That's the day we got Bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But how about those Navy SEALs? I mean are, we getting our money's worth there? Everything in life is so simple. These people said that their mission was successful because they held two rehearsals. And I was thinking, well, maybe we should do that here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found Osama Bin Laden in a mansion that had no cable, no internet service. Honestly, nine years they think he lived there nine years, waiting for Time Warner to show up is what it was. 'When are you coming? Can somebody ? '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't good, you guys. A recent survey found only 7% of eighth graders can correctly name the three branches of government. That's ridiculous. Everybody knows it's the legislative, the executive ? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The unemployment rate went up last month. The unemployment rate went up last month for the first time since November, but on the bright side I hear a senior management position just opened up at Al Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday President Obama will be doing an interview with '60 Minutes.' Michelle Obama will be doing an interview with 'Martha Stewart.' Not to be outdone, Joe Biden will be doing an interview with a panda he made at Build-A-Bear Workshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see President Obama on '60 Minutes' last night? Pretty compelling. He said that when they stormed Bin Laden's compound it was the longest 40 minutes of his life. And mind you, that's coming from a guy who has to listen to Joe Biden. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're announcing that a dog accompanied the Navy SEAL team when they went to the compound. I understand the dog was reportedly very impressed with Bin Laden's ability to roll over and play dead.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems the country of Packoflies, is it Packoflies? Pakistan! I am so -- it's Pakistan. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. They had no idea he was living like five minutes from [their military academy]. Anyway, Pakistan now threatening to end cooperation with the US. Ooh, what are they going to do, cut off our heroin? Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually US officials say we now have a treasure trove of information about Bin Laden. And all of these documents and computer records that were found in the compound. According to the report, now there is a terrorist advisory for our railways. They're going after our railways. They say, the rail lines you should avoid especially -- Amtrak-istan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, experts say based on the videos taken from Bin Laden's compound, we now know he dyed his beard ... although I think it's pretty much washed off by now, Don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they released some of bin Laden's home movies. In most of the footage, bin Laden is just -- he's watching himself. He watches himself on TV. That's what he does. Let me get this straight. He's got a bunch of wives, lived in a huge estate, he likes to watch himself on TV. He's like the Donald Trump of Pakistan. He's just like Trump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And poor Sarah Palin. You know, I don't think she understands. Like today when she found out bin Laden had three wives she said, 'He's a Mormon?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the government will not release the bin Laden death photos. And to be honest, you know something, I don't want to see the photos of bin Laden after he was shot. I want to see the ones just before he was shot where he's going, 'Ahh! Ahh!' That's the picture I want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of disasters, anybody watch the Republican candidates debate last week? You watch that thing? Oh, it was great. Congressman Ron Paul was defending legalized prostitution. He wants to legalize prostitution. Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson wants to support legalizing marijuana. There you go. Hookers and drugs. That's the Republican Party I know. Isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About those Navy SEALs. We're getting our money's worth with those guys, huh? And they got a lot of what they call intel. They have a lot of videodiscs, a lot of DVDs, videotapes. Now they are sorting through them and there is one, you have probably seen it now. Osama bin Laden, sitting on the floor in what looks like a smallish room. He's got a blanket over his shoulders and he's playing with the remote. And he appears to be watching videos of himself on TV. And...no, wait a minute, that's me. For God's sakes, that's what I do. I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had been living in the compound cooped up with all of his wives for five years. When the Navy SEALs came in he said, 'Just shoot me, just shoot me, just shoot me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I got a call from Indian Point, I don't know if you folks are aware I'm boycotting Indian Point. I'm so dumb, I thought it was a casino but it's not. It's a nuclear power plant up the Hudson. And when that thing goes, good night, everybody. So any time I detect electricity coming into my home in Indian Point, I boycott it. And then I get an extension cord and run it from another neighbor. And then this is, shows you what kiss-ups these people are. They don't want trouble, from even me, even a little worm like me. ... So they send me an invitation, would you like to come for a tour to Indian Point. Hey, I don't think so. Built on two faults? Right there on the river, the prize terrorist target in the world. Hey, come up for brunch. No, no, I'm not coming up for brunch. ... That's all I need is people in Indian Point sleeper cells and then the next thing you know...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Check this out. Washington, DC, has a new program that would pay residents $12,000 to move closer to their workplace. It's already a huge hit. In fact, just today, 3,000 prostitutes moved in right across from Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news, Newt Gingrich plans to announce his campaign for President this Wednesday. I don't know about his chances. I mean, I'm not saying Gingrich peaked in the '90s, but his campaign is being sponsored by Tamagotchis and Crystal Pepsi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, Gingrich plans to announce his campaign on Facebook and Twitter. In other words, it looks like MySpace just got a little bit cooler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama giving a lot of interviews now. He is starting to talk about and on '60 Minutes' he gave a big interview on the raid on the compound. The big raid in Pakistan was the longest 40 minutes of his life. There is the possible exception when he asked Joe Biden, hey, what's up? That's my Joe Biden impression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's going on? In a recent interview about the killing of Osama bin Laden, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Dick Cheney said that he gives President Obama high marks. Yeah. And he said, 'Trust me, I know how hard it is to shoot someone in the face.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to new reports, Osama bin Laden would often sit around his compound watching old videos of himself. Yeah. Even stranger was that he would do so while listening to Green Day's 'Time of Your Life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another Republican is about to announce he is running for President ... Newt Gingrich is about to announce. ... Some people say Newt Gingrich may have trouble winning over traditional values voters because he has had three marriages. So as a result, the campaign has announced a new slogan, 'Newt Gingrich, so committed to marriage, he can't stop doing it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon released videos, did you see the home videos of Osama bin Laden? You see that fool watching TV watching himself? Thank God there was no audio because in one of them, he was singing 'Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever you get taken out by somebody, you don't want them going through your stuff, right? If you die, or go to the hospital, you don't want fools rummaging through your stuff. They found herbal Viagra in Osama bin Laden's room. Herbal, so he's looking out for his health. But he wants to be like that. It's natural, ladies. All natural. In the event that your erection lasts for more than four hours or the military comes and shoots your ***, consult a physician. Taking Viagra, dyeing his beard, Osama bin Laden was a Porsche away from being every 55-year-old dude in Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the well, the government has released a number of videos of Bin Laden. Did you see that one? You see the one where he is watching TV? You know that one? He's sitting there watching TV. He's wearing a Snuggie. This is true. He's drinking a Coke. He's flicking the remote between channels. This is a guy who hated the American lifestyle. He was living the American lifestyle, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, they say Bin Laden enjoyed watching old footage of himself on TV. In fact, the only thing he couldn't bring himself to watch, his old 10:00 show. He just couldn't watch that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the police couldn't find Bin Laden, the guy was living like literally next door to the police station. Well, it was revealed today the United States gave Pakistan police $162 million last year. Unfortunately Bin Laden gave them $163 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the interior minister of Paka-lies -- is it Paka-lies? Pakistan. It's Pakistan. Pakistan They said today they have nothing to hide. Well yeah. Not anymore!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'The Sunday Times of London,' a natural form of Viagra was found by Bin Laden's bed. You hear that part of the story? In fact his wives used to say among themselves, 'If he was an underwear bomber, he would have been a dud.' That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now the TSA is getting criticized for checking two-year-olds before the flight. Did you see this? They're patting down two-year-olds. They say two-year-olds can't be terrorists. Yeah. Unless of course, you're sitting next to one of them on a flight, okay? Then it's like worse than terrorists. That's right. Kicking the back of your seat or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich expected to announce his Presidential bid tomorrow on Facebook and twitter. I guess Newt is really into the social media thing. In fact, Facebook is where his second wife found out he was leaving her for his third wife. Did you know that?&quot; In fact his new campaign slogan, 'I only lie to the people I'm married to.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former president, rather governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver are separating. Probably getting a divorce. She'll get the house in Malibu and Arnold will be moving back to Skull Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they gave it a shot and God bless them but that's what happens when you marry outside your species. But Arnold's being a guy about it, he said, 'I'll be back -- for my things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are dicey with Pakistan. ... Here's the latest. Today the White House described the relationship between the US and Pakistan as complicated. In fact, it's so complicated the US just sent our ambassador to get some of our CDs and some of our t-shirts back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities believe that Osama Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children. Yeah, even more astonishing, he named them all George Foreman Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all heard about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mariah Shriver. ... Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver have split up after 25 years of marriage. It will require a mediator, an arbitrator and a translator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A school that Donald Trump started is being sued for fraud. Yeah, apparently, it's a barber college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Donald Trump insisted that he is not racist because one time an African-American won 'The Apprentice.' Yeah, yeah. Because nothing says not racist like making a black man run your errands. Nothing. Nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is attending a summit in Greenland this week with leaders of seven Arctic countries. Yeah. Apparently Obama was like, 'Send the Ice Queen. Make it so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new poll found that Sarah Palin is getting a lot of support in her bid for President from low-income Republicans. You know, like, like Todd Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's international news. The Libyan forces fighting Moammar Gadhafi only have about three weeks of funding left. ... Don't be concerned. I was just saying, it's kind of hard to intimidate an evil tyrant when it's like, 'We will fight you until the end of May! Maybe June 1st!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in El Paso, President Obama made a speech at the United States-Mexican border. Did you see it? About immigration reform? No, you guys were hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Obama] said that every citizen should have a job and be able to speak English. I have to say I agree, and we should start with the deportation of the cast of the 'Jersey Shore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said the Republicans probably want to build a moat around the border and put alligators in it to deter illegal immigration. Go ahead, in an hour they will be shoes and belts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The critics are saying Obama's speech, that he made this speech because he is trying to get the Latino vote. If he really wanted the Latino vote, he would dump Joe Biden and make Sofia Vergaga his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new videogame based on the raid of Osama Bin Laden's compound, in a week. It's called 'Obama's Call to Duty: Half-Black Ops.' And then after you shoot, the screen goes black. Hey, what happened? I want to see what happened. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The rest of you, brace yourself, because last night Newt Gingrich posted this on Facebook. 'Be sure to watch Hannity this Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, I will be on to talk about my run for President of the United States.' This is huge news! Huge-headed news! Because, folks, clearly after months of speculation, Newt Gingrich has finally announced that tomorrow he will be making an announcement. This is the preannouncement announcement we've all been pre-waiting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I haven't been this excited since March when Newt made the pre-pre-announcement that he would be entering an 'exploratory phase.' Which I believe means that he and his candidacy have agreed to an open marriage. Of course, Newt isn't the only Republican candidate who's throwing his oversized hat into the ring where he will then pick it up and throw it into another more important ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Trump has announced that on the season finale of 'Celebrity Apprentice' he may announce a future press conference to announce his announcement. Oh, the rare announcement announcement announcement. That's one more level of announcement than Newt's announcement-announcement. And, folks, there is little doubt what Trump's eventual announcement will be because he's already decided to run. In his mind. In his mind! That means he's a shoe-in, because that's where all his supporters are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, unless you spent the last week living in a cave, you know we killed Osama Bin Laden. By the way, if you do live in a cave, the Navy SEALs are on the way, so enjoy that left eye while you can.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, president Obama gave a big speech at the US-Mexican border. The President called for creating a pathway to citizenship. We already have pathways. They're called tunnels. They're right under where he's standing. Okay, there's like a million of them. Please.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new AP poll, President Obama's approval rating has gone up, all because we shot bin Laden. Actually, it didn't go up nearly as high as Dick Cheney's, when he shot that lawyer. Any time you shoot a lawyer, yeah, you're gonna go up. You know, bin Laden? Okay. Lawyer? Yeah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. Doctors say because of a high salt diet, he had a problem always retaining water. Well, he thought he was retaining water before,&quot; It will be &quot;a huge problem now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the presidential race is getting interesting. In an effort to clear up his reputation as a flip-flopper, Mitt Romney will give a speech on healthcare. And then, right afterwards, he'll give a five-minute rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich announced he is running for President. I think Newt Gingrich would make a very interesting President. I mean, think about it. Every six months, we'd have a different First Lady. I believe Newt Gingrich's new slogan is 'Hey, at least I'm not Trump.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an interview in 'Rolling Stone' this month, Donald Trump said, it's interesting, he said he's never smoked a cigarette in his life. Never had a drink, never had a joint, never had any drugs. Never even had a cup of coffee or a big boy haircut. Never had any of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you looked at some of these Republican candidates? They've really changed. You got Gary Johnson from New Mexico. He wants to legalize drugs. You got Ron Paul. He wants to legalize prostitution. You got Newt Gingrich who admits to committing adultery at least twice. These guys are determined to put the word 'party' back in the Republican Party, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, millions of Ford trucks were recalled. There's a problem with the gas tank. Yeah, they're empty. Nobody's got 110 bucks to fill it up. That's the problem, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich. The Newt is running for president. He announced he was running on Twitter and Facebook and I believe his concession speech will be on YouTube. So he is hooked up and ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. As a matter of fact, do we have the picture of the compound? This was crazy. You're telling me now that the people in Abbottabad, anybody here from Abbottabad? Oh, yeah, the horns guys grew up working clubs in Abbottabad. But, hey, the biggest house in the neighborhood and you're telling me, well, here's the picture of... No, that's Jeter's place. Put it down, forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions on the Application to Replace Osama bin Laden:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. How many threats per minute can you type?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Can you work weekends?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Are you just doing this for the sweet eight-inch picture tube television?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. How do your co-terrorists describe you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. What is the current bounty on your head?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Any ideas for a new catchphrase? 'Death to America' is kind of played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Would you require use of the company llama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. How often do you de-louse your beard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Were you bar-mitzvahed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. What are your long term goals besides not getting killed by Navy SEALs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news for President Obama. It's about time somebody got good news. President Obama's approval rating has hit 60; its highest in two years. That's s way, way up. Experts say at this rate he can count on re-election if he kills Osama bin Laden two more times in the next 12 months. That's the new plan, keep killing him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard this, it's been reported Al Qaeda has not yet picked a new leader to run their terrorist organization. Yeah. Apparently, candidates keep losing interest after asking, 'So what happened to the last guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's true though, Al Qaeda has not picked a new leader yet. They haven't picked one. They narrowed it down to Meatloaf and Lil' John.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still more facts coming out about the raid. It seems they release a new fact about the raid on bin Laden's compound every day and they will continue to do that for about six more years. But senior officials are now saying in addition to Team Six, there was also a team of lawyers standing by in case bin Laden was captured alive. Yeah. This team goes by the much less exciting code name, Team Weissberg, Melman and Pratt. I'm sorry, I like the image of three guys with briefcases running out of a helicopter...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is Donald Trump still running for President? I hope so. Oh, God. I hope so. When you're in my line of work, that's the greatest thing that can happen to you. In a new interview they just gave Donald Trump said he uses Head &amp; Shoulders on his hair. As a result, Head &amp; Shoulders is suing Donald Trump for slander.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol announced she recently had corrective surgery on her mouth. Yeah, the procedure is being called the right surgery on the wrong Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Secret Service started a twitter account this week to update the public on job openings. Yeah, because if there's one thing you want to announce to the world, it's when the Secret Service is understaffed. That's what you want. Very smart move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval right has gone up 60% since the bin Laden raid. You see him? He got that Kool-aid smile. You know who you haven't seen? Qaddafi. Where is that fool? After this whole raid went down he's like, 'I'm not even opening the door for the pizza dude. Slide it under the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sixty percent approval rating. And Obama, he feels it. You know the way he walks in. 'Hello, America. Who I got to put a cap in to get the other 40% percent?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some member of Congress are getting to look at the photos of Osama bin Laden. They said that they are so gruesome, even Nancy Pelosi had a facial expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump told 'Rolling Stone' that it takes him an hour to do his hair every day. An hour to do that! It took the Navy SEALs 40 minutes to get rid of bin Laden. An hour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bristol Palin. Have you seen a picture of her? She is denying that she had a chin implant. Did you see the before and after? Before like this and after? She said it was medically necessary jaw surgery. ... If there is anybody in the Palin family who should have jaw surgery, it is Sarah Palin. Wire it shut! Wire it shut! She has been kind of invisible lately. She hasn't been in the news. I think she is waiting to announce running for President until after moose season is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval numbers are at 60%. The highest that they have been in two years but they change almost daily since he was elected. Let's take a look at some of the ups and some of the downs. For instance, when he won the Presidential nomination, his approval rating was sky-high. All Kool-Aid smiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he announced Joe Biden as his running mate, dropped 30 points. Then when he announced he could have picked Hillary Clinton, it went back up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;They got bin Laden's handwritten diary. Apparently he thought America was totally stuck up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the economy is coming back. I keep hearing that. The economy is coming back. The housing market is still struggling. It's tough all over. In fact, take Bin Laden's compound. I mean, he finally got the mortgage paid off. He's still under water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually one of the items found during the bin Laden raid was bin Laden's diary. Yeah, did you hear about this? Still missing, the little key. Can't get that strap [off.]&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is pretty fascinating. US officials say Bin Laden kept a daily, handwritten journal by his bed, and it's being reviewed right now. A lot of surprises. In fact the very last entry says, 'Dear diary. Hold on. There's somebody at the door. I'll bet it's the pizza guy. Ah!' That was the last, the very last [thing.]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is really odd. This is, for a guy that hated America as much as bin Laden did, according to an interview with Bin Laden's boyhood friend, it said that Bin Laden's favorite TV show was 'Bonanza.' Remember 'Bonanza?' That was Bin Laden's favorite TV show. In fact, you know what they called 'Bonanza' in Afghanistan? Science fiction, you know, people living in the future?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's kind of odd to me. And this is kind of weird. This is a big deal. A Hasidic newspaper in New York, a Jewish newspaper, due to religious beliefs, they edited out Hillary Clinton and another woman from that famous Situation Room photo. Here's a photo. You probably all saw this picture. Well they don't believe in publishing women's pictures in the paper. This is one of these weird things. Well, show the doctored photo. That's the doctored photo right there. See, Hillary and the other woman are not there. That's real. Isn't that amazing? Well, this is not the first time a famous picture has been altered. Oh, no. This famous photo of Albert Einstein. Remember this? Remember that? Show it before it was PhotoShopped. You see, he had a tongue piercing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what is going on with the Republican Party? Have you seen the candidates that are running now? You got Newt Gingrich. He's in the race now. Newt Gingrich is running. He's had three wives. Donald Trump may run. He's had three wives. Rudy Guiliani? He's thinking about getting back in the race. He's had three wives. The only guy with one wife? Mitt Romney. And he's the Mormon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you all remember Mitt Romney. He invented Obamacare before he was against it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, what do you think of this? An Illinois state senator named Shane Cultra said Tuesday he wants to take away the state tax deduction from parents who have an obese child. You know how you get $2,000 tax deduction if you have a kid? Well if your child is obese he wants to take that deduction away. Is that fair? I've heard of getting behind on your taxes, but never getting taxed on your behind. That is wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, President Obama gave a speech about how great it is to have immigrants in our country. Although I understand Maria Shriver may give the rebuttal, so we'll see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well according to TMZ, Arnold Schwarzenegger is willing to do whatever it takes to get Maria to come back. He is so serious, listen to this, he is even thinking about learning to speak English. Have you heard this? He's working with the Rosetta Stone people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in her mid 20s took off all her clothes on a Delta flight to New York, and even worse, the airlines wouldn't cover her with a blanket because she didn't have the five bucks on her. Yeah. Pretty wild isn't it? Woman in her 20s taking off all her clothes, running up and down the aisle of the plane. See, that was in first class. Yeah. See in coach, it's a sweaty fat guy in his tighty-whities. Yeah. That's first class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man responsible for one of the largest bank robberies in US history has finally been caught after 25 years. You know where they found him? Pakistan. Three doors down from Bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Learning more and more about Osama Bin Laden, his objective was he wanted to create political chaos in Washington DC. Well, thank God that never happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Various reactions when we heard that Osama Bin Laden had been killed. My first reaction, I don't know why, when I heard the news I said, 'Oh, jeez, great Now what is Oprah going to do for her last guest?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you something, these Navy SEALs, we're getting our money's worth out of the Navy SEALs aren't we? ... They had a backup plan, the Navy SEALs had a backup plan. These guys are belt and suspenders. Nothing gets by these guys. If the invading of the compound didn't work they had a backup plan. Here is what they were going to do. They were going to invite Bin Laden to an Italian restaurant and they were going to have a gun taped to a toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found in the compound a copy of a diary that Osama Bin Laden would keep. And a buddy of mine from the State Department, Bob called today and he said, 'I'm going to send you some of the entries in the diary and I think you will be able to have some fun with them.' Here now is an entry from the Osama dated April 12th. 'Dear Diary, very unhappy with TV reception. Death to Time Warner.' That's one. April 20, 'Dear Diary, three wives, one bathroom, you do the math.' This is the final entry in the Osama Bin Laden diary, May 1st, listen to this. 'Dear Diary, can't talk now, someone's at the door. Hope it's the Domino's guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Newt Gingrich announced he's running for President, ladies and gentlemen. There you go. Can you feel the heat coming off this guy? Yeah, this could be the political story of the year. 1996!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you! You folks...sound like you just heard Donald Trump isn't running for president. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Donald Trump announced that he will not run for President of the United States. You know why? Can't find his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald said he's not running, even though he said he would have won and could've helped the country. ... He said he wasn't running because his real passion is business. So, in other words, when it came down to helping the country or just helping himself, going to go with himself. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mike Huckabee announced this week he won't be running for president either. Huckabee said it was a spiritual decision. He said he looked deep into his soul, and when he realized he had one, he knew a career in politics was out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney&quot; has &quot;unveiled his new campaign slogan about paying for healthcare: 'Yes, we can. No, wait a minute. No, we can't. Yes, we can. No, wait a minute. No, we can't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love this idea. To save money, Washington state has canceled next year's presidential primary. Now, if we could just get the other 49 states to do this, the candidates wouldn't have any place to campaign, and we would have the best election year ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an interview with ABC News, former President Bush said he was out to dinner at a local restaurant when he got the call from President Obama that bin Laden was dead. In fact, President Bush said...he couldn't quite hear because it's so noisy in those Chuck E. Cheese restaurants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump...announced today he wasn't running for president. What?! The whole thing was a publicity stunt?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trump says he can't run,&quot; because &quot;he wants to spend more time bullying obscure celebrities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is running. ... He looks familiar to me. He looks like&quot; guys in the &quot;paint department from Ace Hardware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt looks like the guy who gives you your driver's test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, hate to be the guy, and I'm sorry about this, but we have hit, the United States of America, has hit the debt ceiling. You know what that means? Neither do I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do think it would be a good idea for us all to start learning to speak Chinese. That's what I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry, by the way, is in Pakistan right now. Because there's been a rift between the United States and Pakistan, because the Pakistanis are saying...to the United States, 'Don't do that again.' And we've pretty much said, 'All right, fine.'&quot; Bin Laden is &quot;'dead. We're not going to do it again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But John Kerry is in Pakistan, and he is sending a strong message to the government and the people of Pakistan. And that message is, 'We think this situation is important enough to send John Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry gets off the plane there in...Islamabad. ... Everybody kept coming up to him, saying, 'Hey, John, why the long face?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda now looking for a new guy to replace Osama bin Laden. They're talking about Ashton Kutcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wanted somebody less controversial than Charlie Sheen, but the head of the International Monetary Fund was busy. So he...can't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama said that killing Osama bin Laden does not secure his 2012 re-election. Yeah, that's been taken care of by the current field of Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump announced today that he is not running for president, even though...he said that he has no doubt that he could win. Really? That's not how you quit a presidential race. That's how you quit a student council race. You're like, 'Whatever. I could totally beat Jessica, if I cared!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this is a bittersweet evening, . Because Saturday marked the end of an era, the era of caring who Mike Huckabee is,&quot; since Huckabee will not run for president in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mike Huckabee, who just last week was leading in many national polls, promised that on Saturday night he was going to announce his presidential plans on what some critics have called 'his television show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So both Huckabee and Donald Trump &quot;have dropped out of the presidential race to spend more time with their TV shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, whoever is the eventual Republican nominee is going to need a lot of money, because it is estimated that Barack Obama will raise over ' $1 billion' for his campaign. That means between now and Election Day, he has to collect $21 a second, which is why his campaign slogan has gone from 'change' to 'Benjamins.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump said he's not running for president. ... This is devastating news for Trump's supporters, all of whom, by the way, are late-night comedians. This ruins my life!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last couple of days, both Mike Huckabee and Donald Trump announced they are not running for president. Huckabee's announcement opens the door for Michele Bachman and Rick Santorum, and Donald Trump's announcement opens the door for Randy Quaid and Gary Busey. Look for them to be running soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot going on with the campaign already. Last week, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul...came out for the legalization of heroin and prostitution. ... Unfortunately, not in enough time to be cast as Charlie Sheen's replacement on 'Two and a Half Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Details coming out still about the bin Laden raid. ... After President Obama...called&quot; former President George W. Bush to explain &quot;how he ordered&quot; a Navy SEAL team &quot;to take out bin Laden, Bush reportedly said, 'Good call.' ... Bush's exact words were, 'Good call, but I still would have sent Batman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of a reversal. Over the weekend, President Obama called for more oil drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. He says he is hoping that one day this will lower the price of gas. I believe that day would be called Election Day, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating, which got a big bump after killing bin Laden, slipped again, which is really bad news. Not for the President. For Moammar Gadhafi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump has announced that he will &quot;not run for president. One political expert says this 'leaves a vacuum that Sarah Palin could fill.' ... You can't fill a vacuum with another vacuum, okay? That's science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mike Huckabee announced he will not be running for president. Apparently, his exploratory committee got lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, political experts say with Mike Huckabee out of the race, this benefits former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, who likes to be called T-Paw. ... So, look who's running on the right. You got T-Paw, you got Newt, and you got Mitt. Is this the Republican Party or the hobbits?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump's not running for president.&quot; This &quot;could be the beginning of another comedy recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm disappointed Donald Trump's not running for president. I was really looking forward to not voting for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Vice President Biden's financial documents, he has less than $100,000 in savings. ... Biden says the rest of his money is tied up in a 'really sick Beanie Baby collection. I could get $500 for Pinchy the crab, but I wouldn't do that to Pinchy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Trump, I can't help but think you left the race too soon. You raised so many questions, like what did your crack team of investigators find in Hawaii&quot; while studying the situation surrounding President Obama's birth certificate? Trump &quot;never told us! ... Was it...a cursed amulet that makes the wearer believe he has information that doesn't actually exist?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't quit. Come back. Look, Donald, we went in way over our heads banking on your running for president. We spent $450 million that we don't have, building The Daily Show's Donald Trump Presidential Joke Headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, how did we get Osama bin Laden, and how can we get him again? The buzz is starting to wear off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he fathered a child with a member of his household staff. Well, according to 'The LA Times,' the woman worked in the house for 20 years and she reported to Maria. I mean, apparently worked directly under Arnold, but she reported to Maria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She...retired in January and received a severance package. How many think Maria should sever Arnold's package? ... Well, you know, at the time this all went down, the woman was married. I guess her husband first got suspicious when he realized she was the first maid to make $1 million a year. Which is very good for Brentwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in other news, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney raised over $10 million in just eight hours this week. Hey, so has the guy who owns a gas station near my house, okay? It's not that big a deal. $10 million. That's $1 for every position he's had on health care. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Glenn Beck announced he plans to hold a rally in Israel this August. See, this could be what the Mideast needs. Someone that both the Arabs and Israelis can hate equally. You know, it would bring them together. Just annoy the hell out of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama met with the King of Jordan yesterday. Of course, Sarah Palin couldn't wait to criticize. She said, 'We're in a financial crisis. He's talking basketball? That's crazy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as per the law, President Obama has released his personal financial report which lists his assets to be anywhere from $3 million to $12 million. You know, only politicians get away with that. Listing their assets somewhere between $3 million and $12 million. The next time the IRS calls you in for an audit, let me know how that works out, will ya?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it's happened. We've reached our limit. The Federal government has hit the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and cannot legally borrow any more money. But wait. Is that really a problem? I mean, can't we work out a deal? I mean, don't we have the head of the International Monetary Fund in one of our jails right now? No, no, I'm thinking bail may be $14.3 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news for the Republicans, Donald Trump is not running for President, not running for President. What? The whole thing was a publicity stunt? What? Really? I wouldn't worry about Donald. He's already got another project going. I mean, this guy's got stuff coming and going. Forget the Presidency look what he's working on now. There it is. It's Trump Abbottabad. Badda-Bing Abbottabad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a fascinating news. Al Qaeda has a new leader, and experts are calling him a temporary leader, and so is SEAL Team 6. His name is Saif El Adele. He worked his way up from the mail bomb room.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump not running for President. What's he up to now? On this weeks' 'Celebrity Apprentice,' Donald Trump asked Meatloaf to teach him to cry. Meatloaf made Trump cry by saying 'You're on a TV show with Meatloaf.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential race is getting exciting though. Ron Paul announced he's running for President. And get this; he supports the legalization of prostitution and heroin. Now, I know he doesn't have much of a chance but if he does win, one hell a victory party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little tidbits keep coming out about the Osama Bin Laden raid. Which makes me crazy because I've mentioned this. But they release one little nugget of information a day. Just to keep -- have you noticed that? They keep stringing us along with 'He was wearing a wax mustache.' You know? 'Did we tell you he was eating fat free yogurt?' We don't care. Doesn't matter. Well the latest document seized at Osama Bin Laden's compound reveals that Bin Laden wanted to attack and punish Hollywood. True story. Yeah. The document is a screenplay Bin Laden wrote entitled 'Yogi Bear Two, the wrath of Boo-Boo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're having a fun day. We're having a fun day. Today is National Visit Your Relatives day. Or as Arnold Schwarzenegger put it, 'better make it two days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Bill Clinton spoke at NYU's graduation today at Yankee Stadium. Congratulations. It was cool. Clinton started with a joke. He was like, 'Just to make it clear, I am not on the team. But I am a player.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone must have heard this. Arnold Schwarzenegger has fathered a child with a household staff member 10 years ago. Don't you hate it when immigrants come here and start having babies? ... Between him and her, I'm going to tell you something, that kid has no chance of speaking English. Zero. It's always funnier when it's somebody else, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's speculation, some say that Maria Shriver knew about the child for a year and she was just act, acting surprised. At least somebody in that family can act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the United States has reached its debt limit, we can't borrow any more money. The United States is in such bad shape, now the government has to call Sell Your Gold. ... It's gotten to the point, this is how bad it is, Uncle Sam might have to go on tour with Charlie Sheen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Folks, this choice right here was a huge surprise because the smart money was on Al Qaeda's long-time number two Iman al-Zawahiri. I know he is an unrepentant mass murderer but I feel sorry him. For decades, he was Bin Laden's second in the command. He should have gotten the promotion. All those late night shifts working in the cave, burning the midnight oil, burning the midnight hostages only to be passed over for a temp who doesn't even have a beard. What's next casual Fridays where everyone comes in wearing denim suicide vests? So Iman, our hearts go out to you and hopefully soon so will our Navy SEALs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama gave a speech outlining his vision for peace in the Middle East. He suggested that Israel go back to the pre-1967 borders. And, of course, Native Americans jumped right on this. They said, 'Why stop there? Let's go back to the pre-1492 borders right here in America? Oh, let's push it all back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger has admitted that he fathered a child with his housekeeper. And, of course, now the kid is angry at his mother for lying to him, you know. She told him his father was an actor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about the maid? This woman kept their love child secret for 14 years. Today, John Edwards said, 'Why can't I meet a chick like that? Why?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a news source, the Army spends $19 million a year just on sniper equipment. And, apparently, no money at all on a system to keep this information classified. Apparently, don't spend any money on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at a book signing in Minnesota, a gay rights activist dumped glitter all over Newt Gingrich. He wants Newt to stop being against gay marriage. But Newt is consistent in his position. He believes marriage is a sacred bond between a man, a woman, his mistress and the other woman he is seeing on the side. That's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this, Dick Cheney, you all know Dick 'Kaboom' Cheney. He's just published a memoir, stories of his life, Dick Cheney and it's in its third printing already. The first two were peppered with buck shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney is a tremendous storyteller. He's especially good at fiction. Do you remember the story he used to tell us about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? He's the best. He really, really is the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of surprises in the Dick Cheney book. You think you know a guy for eight years as Vice President. A lot of surprises. For example, did you realize at one point that he got his maid pregnant?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know there is another what they call posthumous Osama Bin Laden video they released it clearly, and you can tell it's dated because in the video he's still breathing. But in the video, actually it's a historical artifact. And if you watch the video and listen carefully to this video you can actually hear the now famous last words of Osama Bin Laden. Which of course were, 'Will somebody please answer the damn door?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Chapter Titles In Dick Cheney's Memoir:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is cool. Today President Obama said that Hillary Clinton is approaching 1 million frequent flyer miles in her job as Secretary of State. Although even that can't get her upgraded to the seat that she really wants. Air Force One. Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's a scary story. Officials at Chicago-O'Hare are investigating an incident where two planes almost collided right after Joe Biden landed there on Monday. Or as Biden put it, 'Hey, look at these orange sticks I found. What are these? Y-M-C-A!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You guys, Dick Cheney is releasing a memoir in August about his personal and political life. I'm not going to say reading it is torture. It's more an enhanced interrogation technique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;What? Newt's out just because he went on 'Meet the Press' and called the Republican Medicare plan right wing social engineering which then caused 13 of 18 co-chairs of a Gingrich fundraiser to drop out within 24 hours? That's good news for Newt. Thirteen more chicken dinners for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Folks, swimsuit season is right around the corner and there's one place I always turn for my fitness tips, the House of Representatives. Just check out this month's issue of the very not gay 'Men's Health' magazine. That's Illinois Republican Aaron Schock showing off his six-pack abs. And if you look closely you can also see his pathway to prosperity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Now Congressman Schock is partnering with 'Men's Health' to promote a fitness initiative called the Fit For Life Summer Challenge, encouraging all Americans to get fit for life until September. Then we turn back into alfredo-based life forms. I applaud Congressman Schock for using the power of his office to raise awareness of just how ripped he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot of brouhaha going on at the Secret Service now. Officials had to delete a tweet from the official Secret Service twitter account. It made fun of Fox News. Knock it off, Secret Service. That's my job. I don't go around talking into my hand doing courageous stuff. I just realized yelling at the Secret Service is probably not that smart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well the presidential campaigns are in full swing. Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty announced he'll officially launch his 2012 Presidential bid next week in Iowa. See, he's very clever. See, on Monday his campaign slogan, 'Pawlenty, he got you through the apocalypse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tim Pawlenty's friends call him T-Paw. As opposed to everyone else who calls him T- who?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night on FOX News Sarah Palin was asked if she has the fire in the belly to run for President. She said yes. But that's not the problem. It's not the fire in the belly. It's the air in the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's Presidential campaign is now selling official Obama t-shirts with a picture of him and his long form birth certificate that say 'Made in the USA.' It's the truth. In fact, they're selling so well Arnold Schwarzenegger is now making t-shirts that say 'Maid in the Closet,' 'Maid in the Bedroom,' Maid in the Kitchen,' 'Maid in the Den.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are finding out more and more about Arnold's maid. I guess he paid her $1,200 a week plus whatever he could, you know, slip her under the table. But that's the way they did it. $1,200 a week. Yeah. Well, the story keeps getting uglier. Apparently Arnold bought this woman a house in Bakersfield and now the word is he's having sex with the lady who cleans that house, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arnold Schwarzenegger announced yesterday that he is now delaying his return to the movies, so it looked like some good finally did come out of all of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the government is now saying that the $25 million bounty, remember that $25 million for whoever turned in Osama bin Laden, will not be paid to anybody. The government says it's because we got him due to electronic intelligence. Really? You think some Navy SEALs are going, 'Excuse me, bang-bang, hello. Remember the helicopters?' We should give it to them. Don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are getting a lot of valuable information that the electronic intelligence picked up in that compound. For example we just learned that Al Qaeda reportedly considered oil tankers as targets for terrorist attacks. They wanted to blow up oil tankers to hurt our economy, but then they realized they could hurt us more by letting the tankers come here and sell us gas at five bucks a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty awful. Washington, DC high schools are being investigated. What appears to be teachers helping students beat the standardized tests. The teachers are giving them the answers or changing wrong answers for them. Does this make you as angry as it does me? Where were these teachers when I was in high school? I had to cheat off the kid next to me. I didn't have anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, news from the world of broadcasting. The beloved Katie Couric is leaving CBS, and her final broadcast was last night, Katie Couric no longer the anchor of the 'CBS Evening News.' Yeah, she's leaving to run for President. I didn't know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump is not running for President, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, turns out he was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man, this Arnold Schwarzenegger story just keeps getting worse. There are now rumors that Arnold had a second secret child with a different woman. I know. I can't believe Arnold would cheat on his mistress like that. I just can't believe it. I won't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's some political news. This week, President Obama offered $1 billion to Egypt to boost the creation of new jobs. And if that works, they're going to try it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Speaking of the Middle East, NATO air strikes sank eight of Moammar Gadhafi's warships yesterday. They used a very advanced technique to sink his battleships. B8, C8, D8, E8. [ As Gadhafi ] 'Oh, you sunk my battleship, bro. Pretty sneaky, sis.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is interesting. Oregon's Supreme Court ruled that a medical marijuana user can legally carry a concealed handgun. Yeah, yeah. I'm not really afraid of a stoner with a gun, anyway. I mean, they'd be like, 'Okay. Nobody move. Hey, why's nobody moving? You guys are freakin' me out. Somebody move. Is this all fake?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And finally from sports news, Lance Armstrong's former teammate Tyler Hamilton told reporters they both used performance-enhancing drugs during the Tour de France. In response, Lance is like, 'Man, what a kick in the ball.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney has a book coming out. The release date was just announced. August 30. It doesn't have title yet, might I suggest a few? 'How to Shoot Friends and Waterboard People.' Or maybe 'A Dick for All Seasons.' or 'Torture in the Rye.' Or just simply 'Beloved.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Judgment Day did not come. Now, don't confuse that with Arnold Schwarzenegger getting his maid pregnant. That was 'Bad Judgment' Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least one of Harold Camping's predictions did come true. Remember last year he predicted Osama Bin Laden would move to a place with an ocean view. Remember that? So, apparently that part of it played out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are very nervous about this whole rapture thing, although, I think a lot of folks I don't think really understood it. Like Sarah Palin said today, 'The raptures, they were the scariest thing about 'Jurassic Park.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to Homeland Security and all the things they found in that compound, al-Qaida has been plotting attacks against oil tankers and refineries for years. Well, good thing that never happened, huh? I mean, the price of gas might have skyrocketed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to Bin Laden's writings in his journal, he wanted to attack Los Angeles. He planned to attack LA But apparently the car bombers he sent here just went home after getting stuck on the 405. Just turned around and went back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama is in Ireland. He's stocking up on blarney to get ready for the presidential campaign, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dick Cheney has finished his memoirs. I don't want to give too much away, but in the last chapter, he tells Luke he's his father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another landmark decision. The Supreme Court has ruled that California must release 46,000 prisoners because of the cramped conditions in which they live. They say in prison 54 people share a single toilet. You know what we call 54 people sharing a single toilet? Southwest Airlines. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is running for president. He loves campaigning. And his campaign certainly got off to a smooth start. But he likes being on the campaign trail. He's already, over the weekend, he met his next wife. So that's cool.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to mention this, President Obama, you all heard this, is traveling through Europe. Today he was in Ireland. He's in Ireland, yeah. While he's there, Obama's Secret Service code name is the 'Black Guy Who's in Ireland.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legal experts speculate that Schwarzenegger may have to give Maria Shriver up to $100 million in a divorce. Yeah. $100 million. Then when asked for comments, Arnold said, 'But I have families to support. Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States government has finally decided that no one, I repeat, no one, is getting the $25 million reward for the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Yeah. The problem is, nobody wants to be the one to break the news to SEAL Team Six. 'Fellows, how are you? Thank you once again. Right? You all got your iPad certificates?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Newt Gingrich once had a $500,000 debt with the jewelry store, Tiffany's. Yeah. In Newt's defense, he was buying jewelry for nine women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Tim Pawlenty launched his campaign today with a pledge to 'Tell Americans the truth,' which explains his slogan, 'Tim Pawlenty for President, I'm not going to win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge story, this is a bombshell. Indiana governor Mitch Daniels has announced he will not run for President in 2012. Daniels reached the decision after early polling determined that even he didn't know who Mitch Daniels was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is on a big European trip this week and I heard that he's sleeping at Buckingham Palace when he visits England. That's when you know that the US is short on cash. When even Obama's like, 'Hey, is it cool if I crash at your place? No, couch is fine. Couch is fine, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Today, President Obama visited the Irish village where his great-great-great-grandfather was born. Of course, that was always disputed by his great-great-great-grandfather's archrival, Donny McTrump. [Irish accent] 'Now, where were you actually born there, Obama? Gary Busey threw ya under the bus, did he? Yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Obama was in Ireland today. He thought about buying a four-leaf clover for good luck and then, he looked at the field of Republican candidates and decided it wasn't necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Republicans are really starting to worry about their chances in 2012. Mike Huckabee dropped out. Mitch Daniels dropped out. Sarah Palin hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitch Daniels, Indiana governor, Mitch Daniels. He emailed his supporters over the weekend to tell them that he's not running for President. In response, his supporters were like, 'Dad, we live in the same house, couldn't you just tell us in person?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Actually, Mitch Daniels said that he's not running because he loves his family more than he loves his country. The other candidates feel that way too. In fact, Newt Gingrich says he loves all his families more than he loves his country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And finally, in his weekly radio address, President Obama called on Congress to fix the No Child Left Behind policy. And then he called on Arnold Schwarzenegger to fix his 'Secret Child Left Behind' policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama just kicked off a six-day European tour. Which actually is terrifying. This means Joe Biden's in charge!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;We shouldn't be surprised that President Obama has Irish roots. You can use genealogy to trace your ancestors. In 100 years, scientists will be able to determine that three-quarters of all Americans descended directly from Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama was in England where the Queen suggested going back to the pre-1776 borders. Yeah, pull America back to those borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Thursday, President Obama will be visiting France where, as a reciprocal gesture, he'll be attacking one of their hotel maids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with 'Rolling Stone' magazine, Donald Trump discusses his best orgasm ever. He said it was so good he almost dropped the hand mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican Tim Pawlenty announced yesterday he's running for President of the United States. Yeah, I don't care either. You know, I don't want to say Tim Pawlenty is boring, but his Secret Service code name -- Al Gore. Okay, that is his code name. In fact his campaign slogan [Yawns].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Tim Pawlenty's friends call him 'Tee Paw.' That's his nickname, 'Tee Paw.' You know, I always thought that was the Burger King version of the McRib. Do you want the Tee Paw barbecue sauce?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all inside. Well, according to bin Laden's writings in his journal that we seized in that raid, he wanted to attack Los Angeles. But, changed his mind when he realized he had nothing against the Mexican people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how many of you have Newt fever? The horn section always has Newt fever. Newt Gingrich ran up a $500,000 bill at Tiffany's, the jewelry store. Half a million dollars. This is the guy that wants to rein in our spending? Yeah, okay. But today Newt is a little embarrassed about the $500,000 bill at Tiffany's. To show he's a regular guy, today he ran up a $500,000 bill at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the ball game last night? It was the Texas Rangers and the White Sox, I believe, and they're playing in Texas and guess who's in a box seat down the first base side? George W. Bush, former President and his wife Laura. During the game there's a pop foul and it nearly hits the President. Did you see that footage? Finally, fantastically enough, thank God he still has his shoe-ducking abilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Dick 'Trigger' Cheney? Vice President and he has a memoir being published this summer and it's going to be about his eight years as Vice President and it will contain all of the controversial elements of the Bush Administration. Say what you will about Dick Cheney, he's very thorough and he did a great deal of research. And, in fact, get all of the facts, to get all of the truth for his book a few times during the writing of the book he actually had to water-board himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Photographs have surfaced of North Korea's president Kim Jong Il visiting China. But the Chinese government declined to confirm that he was there. Experts say it could be Kim Jong Il but it could be any number of poorly dressed lesbians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Finally, White Sox catcher AJ Pierzynski couldn't catch a foul ball last night and it almost hit George W. Bush. Pierzynski apologized, but Bush was like, 'No sweat. I dropped the ball for eight years. Don't worry about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty serious.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is saying that Edwards spent campaign money on his mistress, so John Edwards could go to jail. My advice, if he does go to prison, lose the pretty hairdo, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news for the state of California. A Supreme Court decision will force the state to release something like 46,000 convicts because of prison overcrowding.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama arrived in France today, for a meeting of the G-8 summit. That's the meeting of the world's top economic powers. To give you an idea of how bad our economy is doing, when the President arrived the other countries said, 'What are you doing here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama drawing a little bit of heat after mistakenly writing the date '2008,' when he signed the guestbook at Westminster Abbey the other day. Did you see that? I guess the President getting such overwhelming admiration and support from the European people, he thought it was 2008 all over again. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some bad news today for Republican presidential candidate, Tim Pawlenty. The Secret Service has turned down his request for Secret Service protection on the grounds that nobody could pick him out of a crowd anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Sarah Palin announced she is going on a bus tour that will include a stop in New Hampshire. And she's covering all bases. She also plans to stop in Old Hampshire as well. You know, to make sure she doesn't miss anything. She doesn't miss a trick, that woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd would like to see a Mitt Romney/Sarah Palin ticket. I think they'd complement each other perfectly. I mean, she can't answer basic questions and he has two answers for every question, so it would work out perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it's been reported that the US was able to find and kill Osama Bin Laden because of a tip from one of his wives. Did you hear that? Apparently one of his wives, yeah. When she saw pictures of her husband's body she went, 'Now who can't drive the car, huh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger ... is being investigated by the California attorney general for allegedly using state police to bring women back to his hotel with lights and siren. 'Get them here quickly now! Get them here now!' With Arnold Schwarzenegger messing around with all these women, I'm amazed he still found time to bankrupt California.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hope you all have a very happy Memorial Day weekend. And hey, how many are gonna pile in the family car, drive down to the gas station, see the price of gas and then drive back home? Are you gonna do that? Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big legal news. The Supreme Court has upheld Arizona's law that penalizes citizens for hiring workers who are in the country illegally. And a related story, in phoenix, Arizona, a head of lettuce now costs $137.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what Newt Gingrich's favorite movie is? Anybody know? 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this story. Newt Gingrich really kind of dug a hole for himself. He's now defending his no interest charge account at Tiffany's, where he's owed Tiffany's as much as half a million dollars. Tiffany's gave him a $500,000 no interest loan. See, the reason no interest is, if Gingrich doesn't buy women diamonds, they show no interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't imagine Newt Gingrich spending half a million dollars on diamond rings. Onion rings, maybe. Or even ring dings, possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the kind of story that causes problems. Republican Congressman Joe Walsh has generated some controversy by saying the only reason Barack Obama was elected president is that he's black. Well, sure, everybody knows that. You want to get elected president of this country, you have to be black, right? Come on. How many white guys have been president? Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we couldn't be more excited. This Sunday, Sarah Palin starts a nationwide bus tour, which I think is a really good way for her to learn the names of all of the states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like Sarah Palin might be running for president. What do you think of that, huh? Doesn't it make you nostalgic for last week, when we only thought the world was gonna end? Remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a very odd medical case. I've never heard of this but I heard it from three different sources, so I guess it's true. This 55-year-old woman is allergic to electricity. She has a bad reaction whenever there is electricity in the air. Yeah. And to keep her safe, they're making her stay at a Tim Pawlenty campaign rally. Cause that's the only place where there's no electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about bin Laden and his final moments. When they found him, he had about $800 in cash on him. He had two phone numbers stitched into one of his things that he would wear. One was for the Abbottabad cab company. And the other phone number was for somebody named Rhonda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;We have thousands of servicemen and women in town, New York City for Fleet Week. So if you see them out at a bar, buy them a shot. In fact, buy them two shots in honor of the ones they gave bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's some political news. Mitt Romney plans to officially announce his presidential campaign next Thursday. He'll be unveiling his new slogan, 'Mitt Romney, even I'm not excited about me. And I'm me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You guys know about this? The US Navy designed a new video game for soldiers to learn to catch Somali pirates. That's got to be confusing when you're out in combat. It's like 'I see pirates. What should we do?' 'Press 'b'!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night we took a measured look at ... God, there's really no way to cover this Weiner story in a non-adolescent fashion. ... The upshot is obviously it's a very strange story. The Congressman possibly tweeted a picture of his junk or had his...Twitter account hacked. And a picture of his junk sent or a picture of someone's junk sent. Bottom line, there was a junk shot. Oddly enough that's the name of the method BP used to clog the gulf oil leak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Donald Trump taking Sarah Palin out to dinner] &quot;Famous Famiglia is on 50th and Broadway. I've eaten there, that pizza is fine. I used to eat there a lot when I was working next door at Caroline's Comedy Club. It's good convenience pizza. Back in the 80's there weren't a lot of food options. It was Famiglia's pizza or edible underwear from one of the porn shops. Giuliani took that option away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Donald, I don't want to say anything, but if you're taking an esteemed visitor to get real New York pizza, Famiglia's ain't it. ... Unless real authentic New York Pizza can also be found in Terminal Four of the Phoenix Airport. Governor Palin no disrespect to you, you're a guest in our city, we should offer you the finest that our hospitality has to offer you. I just would have thought Captain Combover could have pulled that one off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Good to have you with us. Folks, last night I told you about semi-Governor Sarah Palin's new One Nation Bus Tour. Her freedom wagon of PAC-funded professional tourism. Well, it's only day four and she's already managed to do the unthinkable, spend four days on a bus without looking like she spent four days on a bus. ... Of course, the point of her 'One Nation Tour' is to highlight America's historic landmarks. So far she stopped at the National Archives, Gettysburg, Independence Hall, and yesterday she joined Donald Trump at one of New York's historic monuments, the Times Square Applebee's, a landmark as steeped in history as it is steeped in chipotle mayonnaise. Just like Gettysburg, it's a site where many, many lives were cut short.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;No, I'm sick to death about our national debt. We have got to get our financial house in order, folks. But the Chicken Little Democrats are so worried the US will default on its loans. So they want to raise the US debt ceiling. Come on! We already raised the debt ceiling under President Bush. That is so 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and twice in 2008.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So folks the debt ceiling has not been raised. But don't panic, investors. We're not going to default. Before the vote Republican leaders called Wall Street executives to assure them the vote was just for show. Yeah, it's just for show like the sneeze guard on a salad bar. It looks good but all you got to do is duck under it and sneeze on the croutons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yes, Wall Street loves jokes. Remember that last prank they pulled with the mortgage market? Knock, knock. Who's there? Get out of your house. The bank is foreclosing. Raccoons live here now. I guess you had to be there. Literally you had to. It was global. It affected everybody. And now, Republicans can say one thing to Wall Street. And the complete opposite to the Tea Party at the exact same time. Because to one of those groups, they are talking out their [bleep]. But don't tell me which one, I'm tivo-ing the end of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Everyone wants to talk about it [the debt limit]. But Weiner can't talk about it because the mainstream media keeps focusing on this picture that appeared on his Twitter account. Folks, I feel sorry for the guy. He's a friend of the show. And this has got to be a big weight on his shoulders, and judging by this photo, his left thigh.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need to shut my phone off. I'm getting a tweet. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. From Congressman Anthony Weiner. Look at that. Oh, my gosh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Anthony Weiner finally spoke to the news media today. Apparently wanted to wait till his pants came back from the dry cleaners. Well to give him credit he took full responsibility. He says, yes, that was his penis. He did send those photos. Finally, a man taking responsibility for his own penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; I mean, with all this new media, is this junk e-mail? Or is it e-mail of your junk? You see, there are so many terms.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the economy. We have the war. But let's face it. We're all in ninth grade. The media reported it, this all started with a lewd photo of a man's crotch was sent to one of Congressman Weiner's Twitter followers. Did they have to say lewd? Are there tasteful photos of men's crotches out there? This one I got today is so much better than the one I got. It shows you how the political race has changed. It wasn't that long ago when candidates would ask each other, 'Where is the beef?' You can't ask that now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the chairman of the New York Republican Party Ed Koch said that he will use these pictures to help defeat Anthony Weiner so now we have Koch versus Weiner. It doesn't stop. It's awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what today is? The anniversary of D-Day. Or as Sarah Palin calls it the day when Paul Revere warned the Americans that the Danish were coming. Yes. When she was asked her thoughts about the Allied landing at Omaha Beach she said it was a turning point in recapturing Nebraska from the Germans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this and other things. This whole controversy about the midnight ride of Paul Revere. Apparently Sarah Palin was in my hometown of Boston and she claimed Paul Revere rode through the town warning the British that they wouldn't be taking our guns away. Actually Paul Revere warned us the British are coming. How many wish there were a Paul Revere today who would warn us Sarah Palin is coming?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, unemployment is at 9.1%. The White House says this is good news. White House says this is good news because it means more people are looking for jobs. You know, more good news like that and everybody in the White House will be out looking for jobs. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, while we were off last week there were more allegations about Arnold Schwarzenegger, the tabloids say he may have fathered a second child by a flight attendant. A flight attendant allegedly had sex with him. How did that happen? I can't get them to bring me an extra bag of peanuts. How do you get the flight attendant -- I mean, think about that. I mean -- I mean, if a blanket is $7 how much is sex?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty has entered the race. Yeah. I don't want to say this guy is boring but today he was endorsed by the Sleeping Air Traffic Controllers Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is Congressman Anthony Weiner, do you know all about this? I am a little late to this party. And boy, what a party it is. He apparently is in some kind of trouble. I don't know if laws were broken or not. But he was sending around pictures of his of him in his, uh, in his underpants. And I thought well now wait a minute what is the big deal. Don't Congressmen ... Don't they get to mail their packages for free?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story seems to be Congressman Anthony Wiener. I love his name. ... Today he held a press conference. And -- yeah. He admitted that he sent the lewd photo himself, ok. That's what he admitted, yeah. He sent the lewd photo himself. And a reporter asked him, 'What were you thinking?' And things got awkward when the Congressman looked at his crotch and said, 'Well, answer the man! You got us both in this mess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are other stories. Today, I don't know if you know this, if you're history buffs, today is the 67th anniversary of D-Day. The day the Allies landed at Normandy Beach during World War II. Yeah. Or as Sarah Palin calls it, the day the Nazis fought the Vikings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Well, it's official, turns out it was Weiner's wiener. That's right. At a press conference this afternoon, Congressman Anthony Wiener admitted that he tweeted out that photo of his crotch. During the press conference, Congressman Wiener was choked up and got a lump in his throat. Not as big as the lump in his underwear, but still a very emotional...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Been a crazy few days. First, Wiener admitted that he tweeted out that photo of his crotch and John Edwards was indicted for covering up an affair. Or as Arnold Schwarzenegger put it [as Schwarzenegger] 'Thank you, God! This is the best week ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;First Lady Michelle Obama is taking Sasha and Malia to South Africa and Botswana. Or as Sasha and Malia call it, 'Not Disney World. Thanks, mom.' That's right, Michelle is taking Sasha and Malia to South Africa and Botswana. And Sarah Palin was like, 'Wow, they're going to all the places that Paul Revere went. Isn't that cool?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is surprising. A new Republican presidential poll has Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza tied for second with Sarah Palin. Or as Obama put it, 'Do I even need to campaign at this point?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend Sarah Palin on her bus got stuff wrong again. Stepped in it again. Told a reporter that Paul Revere made his famous ride to warn the British. If Paul Revere were alive do you know what he would say today? 'The morons are coming!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Weiner scheduled a press conference for 4:00. I decided to tune in. And Andrew Breitbart the owner/operator of the website Big Government was in the neighborhood in New York City, showed up and took over Weiner's press conference. ... This is the weirdest [bleep] story I've ever seen in my life. Or the greatest episode of Maury ever. So, after Breitbart's 4:00 p.m. press conference that was for Congressman Weiner, it was time for Congressman Weiner's post Breitbart press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There you have it. At 4:25 Eastern Standard Time this story officially became sad. You know, we forget sometimes... I certainly do-- that these people are human. And that's the lesson that is going to stay with me. Until I turn back to the camera over there and do a little bit on the John Edwards' story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So remember this guy? [John Edwards] He lost the presidency. He lost the vice presidency. He went on television, lied about having an affair, and he went on television and admitted the affair but lied about having a baby with the affair. You know, it seemed like John Edwards ... couldn't sink any lower. ... Apparently he's going to jail on charges of grand larceny because that beautiful head of hair just stole my heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And I tell you, folks, this whole sordid, sad delicious and sadly delicious sordid saga just reinforces what I've always said. Democrats don't share our values. An elected official is tweeting dirty photos of himself to strange women who he never meets for sex? Come on! At least Republicans Chris Lee was trying to get some action. Republican politicians are man enough to hit that thing. Ensign, Vitter, even when it's a gay scandal, they're not tweeting love letters; they're tearing up an airport bathroom until somebody calls the cops on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to TMZ, the day after First Lady Michelle Obama unveiled the new USDA guide to healthy eating President Obama was spotted in Ohio eating two chili dogs. Look at this picture. There's the proof right there. Look at that, you know what I mean. That's two politicians this week getting in trouble for their wieners. That's two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as I mentioned earlier, after 20 years the USDA has done away with the food pyramid as a dietary guideline. Well, they had to get rid of it. It didn't work. Since they came out with that thing most Americans have turned into food pyramids. Right? Small at the top, wide at the bottom, filled with food. That's what we are. We're the food pyramid now, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama and House Majority Leader John Boehner, planning to play golf together. They say it's a bonding experience where the two men can learn to work together. Yeah, what a great idea. What a better way to show voters how committed you are to helping the economy than taking a day off work and playing golf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile unemployment back up to 9.1%. You see when the economy is bad it means more budget cutbacks, which means more teacher lay-offs, which means the next generation won't even know as much about American history as Sarah Palin. Do you know how frightening that is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the economy? Is it getting better or not getting better? You folks got any dough? I got no dough. You know who's got all the money? The Chinese. They've got all the money. No President has ever been reelected, that's what they're saying about Obama, they're saying no President has ever been reelected under these kind of economic conditions. ... Yeah, unless they're running against Pawlenty, Romney or Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the Republican candidates, these guys look like the membership committee at a restricted country club, don't they? You take a look at these Republican candidates and I bet you Barack Obama wishes he hadn't spent that money on a new birth certificate, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More great facts are coming out about Weinergate. When you're in my business, and you get to say Weinergate, it's the greatest thing in the world. A lot of new facts coming out. One of the women that Congressman Weiner was sexting turns out to be a porn star. Did you know that? He was sexting a porn star. When asked how it was possible to get involved with someone in such a sleazy business the porn star said, 'I don't know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince William and his wife, Kate, have posted an ad for a housekeeper. Yeah. When Arnold Schwarzenegger heard this he said, 'So it looks like they do want to start a family.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it's been reported that the Chinese economy has showed signs of slowing down. Yeah. Experts say that that is what happens when your work force starts to enter its teens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new poll shows that President Obama is losing the popularity boost he got after Osama Bin Laden's death. Or as Gadhafi's putting it [ as Gadhafi ] 'Uh-oh. Not good for me, bro! Hey, can I hide out in your cave?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not good, folks. Congressman Weiner has admitted he did carry on an explicit online relationship with six different women. Well, he thought they were women. Turns out three were women. One was a guy pretending to be a woman, and the other two were other Congressmen. He had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, President Obama's top economic adviser, a man named Austan Goolsbee is stepping down. He'll be replaced by something a little more effective -- the Magic 8 ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama said today he is not concerned about a double-dip recession. He is more concerned the recovery we're in is not creating enough jobs. In fact, you know what you call a recovery that isn't creating enough jobs? A recession. That's what it's called.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' the Federal government now owes $61 trillion for programs like Medicare and social security. The biggest reasons, people are living longer. ... Today President Obama told Americans to ignore his wife's nutrition advice. Eat whatever you want. Cheeseburgers, pizza, have a couple of beers, pork rinds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, next week is going to be a big Republican presidential debate with all the major candidates. And this will give Republicans a chance. They'll have a real story. They can choose between a person they've never heard of, a person they don't like or a person that has no business running for President. So they there is a real choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Democratic Congressman by the name of Earl Blumenauer has written a letter to the National Park Service questioning whether they are giving Sarah Palin special treatment during her bus tour of historic sites. So what if they are? I mean, shouldn't the Park Service be giving special help to people who know nothing about American history?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When there's trouble, and believe me, I've had my share of trouble, you can always tell who your friends are, and this poor guy, Anthony Weiner, has no support from nobody. Nobody wants to know from nothing about Anthony ? except, you know who is supporting Anthony Weiner, and I thought this was nice, Newt Gingrich. Today Newt Gingrich sent him a $10,000 cell phone case from Tiffany's. Very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Weiner is calling Democratic supporters, former Democratic supporters begging for, you know saying, 'I need your support.' Congressman Anthony Weiner reportedly called and apologized to Bill Clinton for the entire scandal. Did you hear that? He called Bill Clinton and Clinton said, 'Tell me everything, and I mean everything.' He did call President Clinton to apologize and when Bill suggested he call Hillary, Weiner said, 'Don't worry, I just sent her a text.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, President Obama proclaimed June to be lesbian-gay bisexual and transgender pride month. They waited until June because that's when 'Glee' is in reruns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-one percent of New York voters said Congressman Weiner should keep his seat. The other 49% say he should disinfect it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats in Congress seem to be distancing themselves from the Anthony Weiner scandal. Just to be safe, everybody's staying a good six to eight inches away at all times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Listen to this, a new study found that being bored can be good for your brain. Which explains that new campaign slogan 'Mitt Romney: I'm good for your brain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, here's some good news. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is predicting that the economy will pick up in the second half of the year. You know what that means! Nothing. It means nothing. He's said it before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And finally, former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson is upset that CNN excluded him from next week's Republican debate. It was too bad. I mean, because after Congressman Weiner, think of all the fun we could have with a President Johnson? Wouldn't that be amazing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was one depressing litany of miserable economic news. It was against this backdrop that President Barack Obama went to a Chrysler factory, strapped on the goggles and offered a congratulatory handshake to the few remaining people in the country who still have jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, the 2012 Republican presidential race is heating up faster than a slice of Godfather's Pizza. Mostly because former Godfather's CEO Herman Cain has fired up his liberal burning oven. They love him in New Hampshire, but Iowa Republicans have eyes on Cain, too, and not just because before they recognized him they were about to call security.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are having nice weather here in California. What is it? Like 65? Nice and cool today. But back East, oh my gosh. A hundred degrees all up and down the East Coast. Man, people are sweating like John Edwards and Arnold Schwarzenegger waiting for Father's day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot President Obama couldn't tell if it was the heat he was feeling or Mitt Romney breathing down his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot in Washington everyone was sitting around in their underwear like Congressman Weiner. He finally felt at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand the way Washington works. Now, explain it to me. We are not allowed to see Osama bin Laden's death photo because it's too explicit. But our Congressman's penis, that's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Well, the latest news is that the Congressman Weiner's wife is pregnant. Yeah. I'll tell you how creepy this is. When his wife first called to tell him she was pregnant he said, 'Huh? Who is this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know who married Weiner and his wife? Bill Clinton. In fact, Weiner called Bill Clinton and apologized. That's when you know you have a problem. Okay? When your sexual behavior has offended Bill Clinton. That's where you just go, 'Okay time to draw the line.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have agreed to play a round of golf together. Oh, please. Imagine the two of them at the end of the golf game? Boehner will be crying over the score, and Obama will be giving three explanations as to why his score is actually better than it appears. Well, now it looks like Vice President Joe Biden will be joining them. Well, sure. Somebody's got to carry the bags. So you got to have somebody do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest 'ABC News' poll, President Obama and Mitt Romney are in a virtual tie. Well, that's not surprising. Of course they're in a tie. They both endorsed the same exact health care plan. That's why they're tied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am going to move on. Well, listen to this. You hear what happened to Newt Gingrich? Oh, this is unbelievable. Today Newt Gingrich's entire staff quit. They walked out. His campaign manager quit, his press secretary quit, his political strategist. They all resigned together. See, that's bad. When the guys paid to believe in you don't want anything to do with you anymore. That's a bad sign. ... And Gingrich is furious. He said, 'Fine, fine. they can forget about getting the beautiful commemorative key ring from Tiffany's. That's out. That is out.' Kind of ironic, somebody walking out on Newt Gingrich without warning. Now he knows how his ex-wives feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Sarah Palin is going to London in July to try and meet with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And today Margaret Thatcher made it clear she will not meet with her. And of course Sarah Palin is furious. She said, 'Who let her know I was coming? Is this Paul Revere again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks have Mitt Romney fever? Well, Mitt Romney is saying that he believes and agrees that the world is getting warmer but he's got a plan. If he is elected President, you know what Mitt Romney is going to do because of the global warming climate change? He's going to loosen his tie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the Republican candidates so far? Let's run them down. You have Newt Gingrich, the Newt! You have Mitt Romney, and a couple other guys I don't know. It looks like those guys in the Flomax commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. Congressman Weiner's apartment, this is true, which has been up for sale has been taken off the market. Apparently potential buyers became suspicious of what he meant by full southern exposure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, this heat wave has been terrible. Today, the temperature was 100 degrees here in New York. It was so hot, Anthony Weiner took off his pants just to stay cool. No other reason. He took a picture while he was at it. He figured, why not?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama has offered bailout money to keep Greece from defaulting on its loans. Yeah, when Greece thanked him, Obama was like, 'Don't mention it ... to China 'cause it's their money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is nice. President Obama wrote an essay for 'People' magazine about being the father he never had. Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote an essay about being the father no one knew he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So I have yet to address the big election news. Last week mitt Romney went to New Hampshire and declared his intentions. ... Mitt Romney may not be my favorite candidate but I can say this, he's also not my second or third favorite candidate. He's hovering about five or six depending on whether Ted Nugent jumps in. He is the only candidate whose health plan covers cat scratch fever.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in other news, Alabama has enacted the nation's toughest immigration law. Is that a big problem? People trying to sneak into Alabama? What are like five people affected by this law? Really? No, it's very tough. They don't want anybody entering that state illegally unless they can play running back for the University of Alabama. Then it's 'Hey, Juan! Buenos dias? Buenos dias? Roll tide! Buenos dias, Juan?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Weiner &quot;said today, again, he is not resigning, and there's one thing we know about this guy, he knows how to stand firm. So he is not resigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a survey by a social networking site in Europe asked 30,000 people in 15 different countries who they thought the funniest nationality on Earth was. Do you know who came in first? We did. America. We are considered the funniest people on earth. So Sarah Palin, thank you for making America number one. Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 24,000 pages of Sarah Palin's e-mails, these are e-mails she sent while she was governor, were made public today. Some are kind of embarrassing, yeah. Turns out she once spent an entire week trying to e-mail Paul Revere, you know, getting ready for that trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Congressman Earl Blumenauer wrote a letter to the National Park Service questioning whether they've been giving Sarah Palin special treatment during her bus tour of historic sites. But the Park Service is adamant. They said no. No. They have always offered remedial lessons to anyone that asks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Newt Gingrich has a new campaign slogan. 'Hey, where did everybody go?' Did you hear about this? I never heard of this happening. This week, Newt Gingrich's entire campaign staff quit. Like 16 people. They walked out. But Gingrich's quest for the Presidency will continue according to the new campaign spokesman, Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. It turns out that ten days before Anthony Weiner tweeted that explicit photo, Congress published a report about the dangers of sexting. Yeah. Weiner was going to read it, but something came up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, happy birthday to Sasha Obama, who turned 10 years old today. Happy birthday, Sasha! It was cute. It was really cute. Especially when Michelle had Sasha blow out the candles on her birthday lettuce. It was like 'Go ahead, blow it out. Don't eat it yet. Give me ten. Give me ten!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, did you hear about this? It was just revealed that Osama bin Laden's bedroom had the only air conditioner in his entire compound. Yeah. I'm starting to think that guy was a bit of a jerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in more serious news, two US F-15 fighter jets had to intercept a small civilian plane that swooped toward Camp David, while President Obama was there. Pretty scary. Turns out it was just someone completely lost, had no idea where they were headed. So apparently, the pilot must have been one of Obama's economic advisors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Chinese credit rating house is claiming that the United States has already been defaulting on its massive debt, which is hard to believe. I mean not that we are defaulting but the Chinese actually believe we're going to pay them back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the 'Wall Street Journal,' economic experts now fear there may be a second recession. Hey, second recession? When did the first one end? Does anybody know? Do you remember that big day when we all celebrated when it was over?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is bad. The economy is so bad; bed bugs are now infesting sleeping bags in tents because they can't afford to stay in hotels any more. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, Arnold Schwarzenegger now cleaning his own house. That's how bad -- The economy is so bad, Lebron James can't even afford to make excuses. That's how bad. I'll tell you how bad it is, you know the IMF? They changed their name to WTF. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Congressman Weiner has now checked himself into a treatment center for people battling chronic sexual dysfunction. Checked in? He's already there. It's called Congress. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and these latest, have you seen these latest photos of the Congressman? He's naked at the congressional gym. I don't know. Is it that surprising that Anthony Weiner took pictures of himself at the gym? Now, if Barney Frank took pictures of himself at the gym that would be shocking. Not that Barney's naked, that Barney Frank's actually at a gym. Has that ever happened? Has Barney Frank ever been in a gym? I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's sunny today, beautiful day outside. So sunny Anthony Weiner saw his shadow. And that means 6 more weeks of Weiner jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the latest batch of Anthony Weiner cell phone photos taken apparently at the congressional gym. Wait a minute, those guys have a gym? So those fat sweaty guys walking around, they go to a gym?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TMZ published a nearly nude photo of Congressman Wiener which was taken in the congressional gym. Newt Gingrich was shocked and said, 'There's a congressional gym?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich is having his own problems. Most of Newt Gingrich's campaign staff all quit on the same day, and some people are blaming newt's third wife. When asked about it, Newt said, 'Don't worry. I'll win them back with my fourth wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Republican debate tonight. Are you excited about that? We'll add applause later. Tonight's GOP debate will be the first to feature Mitt Romney. ... Experts are predicting kind of a big fight between Romney and his biggest ideological opponent, Mitt Romney from four years ago. Those guys don't agree on anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, male politicians run for office to be somebody, while female politicians run so they can do something. Isn't that interesting? Yeah, there you go. This study has a margin of error of plus or minus Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Anthony Weiner announced that he's taking a leave of absence but that he's leaving the door open. Uh, no word on what he's using for door stops. But apparently Anthony Weiner, he won't decide if he's resigning until his wife comes back from her trip to Africa with Hillary Clinton. I don't know what's more ridiculous, that he thinks he can stay in office or that he thinks his wife is coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Sarah Palin's newly released e-mails show that she and George W. Bush discussed the 2008 election. That's right. E-mails between Palin and Bush otherwise known as spell-check's worst nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a wild story. Did you hear about this? You see this guy who says he's going to dive down into the Indian Ocean, find the body of Osama bin Laden, and bring it up to the surface. You know who the guy is doing it? It's President Obama. No, he needs to shoot bin Laden again. Get those poll numbers up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said yesterday regarding the economy, he said, 'The sky is not falling.' That's what he said, the sky is not falling. Oh, the poll numbers are falling, the market's falling, support for the war in Libya's falling. Anthony Weiner's pants are falling. But the sky, the sky is fine. There's no problem with the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a latest survey on the economy, 48% of the people surveyed think we'll have a Great Depression. The other 50% think it will be just a pretty good depression. It won't be that great. It'll be okay. It'll be a nice depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, the economy is bad, it's bad everywhere. The economy is so bad in New Jersey, Snooki couldn't afford to go to a tanning salon. Rubs her body with Cheeto dust. That's how bad. The economy is so bad in Washington. Newt Gingrich, now buying his jewelry at Costco. That's how bad. The economy is so bad here in Hollywood, Steven Tyler now has to buy all his dresses at Forever 21. That's how bad. And in New York, no day at the beach either. I tell you ,the economy, you know that French guy Dominique Strauss-Khan? He's now attacking housekeepers at the Red Roof Inn. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, honestly, if I can be serious here for a second, if you think about it, the only thing -- the only question is what is Anthony Weiner guilty of, really? Really, what is he guilty of? Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what the man the guilty of. He's guilty of being too photogenic. That's his problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Anthony Weiner is now getting a lot of pressure from Democrats to resign and I'd like to take a second here and I think I speak for everybody, I think I speak for myself, I think I speak for Jay Leno, I think I speak for Conan O'Brien, I speak for Jimmy Fallon, George Lopez, Jimmy Kimmel, Craig Ferguson. David Frost. Merv Griffin. Jack Parr and Johnny Carson when I say 'Hey, mind your own business! He doesn't need to resign!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said if it was him, he would resign and Bill Clinton said 'Well, if it was me I wouldn't be surprised.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the Republican debate last night? Oh my God! Those guys up there and Michele Bachmann and it was exciting and you know who did well? Michele Bachmann. Bachmann did well. Newt Gingrich was so impressed with Michele Bachmann he gave her a $200,000 gift certificate from Tiffany's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann, they look like the Channel 7 news team, Don't they? Eyewitness news with Mitt and Michele.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican debate was last night. During the GOP debate ... Mitt Romney interrupted the proceedings to announce the hockey score. This can only mean one thing Mitt Romney has already written off the black vote. It's not happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's presidential debate candidate Herman Cain was asked if he liked deep dish or thin crust pizza. Newt Gingrich interrupted by saying, 'Wait there's pizza?' He's heavy. Michelle Bachman playfully slapped Newt Gingrich on the wrist. In a related story, Newt Gingrich left his third wife for Michelle Bachman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, did you hear what he said? He said today that he would be ok with being a one-term President. He said that, yeah. And with that Obama carefully aimed an iPhone, got in his pants and pressed send.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, tomorrow, the White House is holding a huge picnic for members of Congress but there's a chance that it might rain. I wouldn't worry, though, I hear Anthony Weiner is pretty good at pitching a tent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And finally, according to a recent analysis, Sarah Palin's e-mails show that she has an eighth grade reading level. Palin called that pretty insulting while eighth graders called it very insulting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Alabama just passed a tough immigration law that requires schools to find out if students are in the country illegally. Fortunately, schools know what to look when identifying foreign students. High test scores. 'You did well. No way you're from here. Come with us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican candidates last night held a debate in New Hampshire, where it's exciting. It was Tea Party candidate Michele Bachmann and six dudes. It looked like the worst episode of 'The Bachelorette' ever! 'Do I get a rose?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The polls say the race for the Republican nomination is a tie between Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, a tie. So right now it's the Mormon versus the moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news. The price of gas has come down a little bit. Yeah, it went down 28 to 40 cents a gallon. But, see? Just in time for summer vacation. But that's the oil company's plan. You see? As soon as you're 300 miles from home, they jack it back up again. You go on vacation. You get there. Oh, it goes back up again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, only 12% of American high school students can pass a basic history exam. That is the lowest percentage since our country was founded in 1922.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, by all accounts, the two big winners at the Republican debate Monday night were Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann. One, of course, the tall brunette with pretty hair. The other is a Congresswoman from Minnesota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good campaign gossip. Sources close to the Newt Gingrich campaign, say that ? you know, his staff quit. The whole staff, like, 60 to 70 people, they all walked out. They say they quit because Newt's wife, Callista, had too much influence. Yeah. And you know, I think that might be true. Have you heard Newt Gingrich's new campaign slogan? 'Yes, dear. Yes, dear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Utah governor John Huntsman skipped the debate the other night because he hasn't officially declared himself a candidate yet. But he's going to declare next week. He's going to say he's running for President. Anybody ever heard of this Huntsman guy? Former governor of Utah and a former ambassador to China, which qualifies him to be President. 'Cause, let's face it, these days, Presidents are basically ambassadors to China. Aren't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, several Congressmen have filed a lawsuit against President Obama for getting us involved in Libya. They claim Obama got the US in a Middle East war without authorization from Congress. To which Dick Cheney and Bush said, 'You can get sued for that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview this week on the 'Today' show, President Obama said if he were Congressman Anthony Weiner, he would step down. And do you realize if Weiner did step down because of President Obama, that would be the first new job Obama's created in the last two years?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's where you want to be a fly on the wall for this one. Anthony Weiner's wife arrived home today after being overseas for the past couple of weeks. Hey, I didn't see the paper, honey. Anything new? Actually, I feel sorry for her. What can she do? I mean, if she burns all his clothes in the driveway, so what? He sits around in his underwear all day anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican candidates, did you folks see the Republican candidates? Oh my God. You got Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann and you got a bunch of other guys, you got Newt, you got Ron Paul. I bet Obama now is sorry he spent that money on the new birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is a big day in the Weiner household. Anthony Weiner is being reunited with his wife. Well that should go pretty well. And Weiner asked that the people respect his privacy and well I guess that really wasn't a concern when he was texting photos of his junk. No, I don't think it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this is a little awkward. Congressman Weiner's wife returned today from a diplomatic trip to Ethiopia. She has been in Ethiopia when this happened. She was tired of people in Ethiopia saying to her, 'I feel so sorry for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that only 35% of fourth graders know the purpose of the Declaration of Independence. Yeah, crazy. When Sarah Palin heard this, she said, 'Well, how are they supposed to know about something that happened 20 years ago?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Tea Party group is running a summer camp for kids. Yeah. It's the only camp where the kids sit around the bonfire and hear scary stories about taxing the richest 2%.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is surprising, you guys. A new survey found 87% of high school seniors are less than proficient in US history. Not me, I mean, in fact when I was a senior, I did a ten page paper on my favorite President, George Jefferson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news, we'll not be getting any more junk mail from Congressman Anthony Weiner. Yeah, no more of that. Yeah, Anthony Weiner announced today he is stepping down. I guess he finally realized he couldn't stick it out any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, if you live in New York now, you're only left with one disgraced Congressman representing you, Charles Rangel. So, you only have the one disgraced guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the evidence just kept mounting against him. It was unbelievable. You probably heard of this. A former porn star, an actress who exchanged e-mails with Weiner, held a press conference with the lawyer, Gloria Allred. Did you see this yesterday? And the porn star said that Weiner often steered the conversation toward sex. You know, I don't want to defend the Congressman but she's a porn star! What are you gonna talk about, the debt ceiling?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad. At Monday night's Republican debate, Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney had to share the same can of hair spray. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, at Disneyland, I saw Goldilocks selling her hair for cash for gold. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, at the 'Today' show, Kathie Lee and Hoda have been reduced to drinking Mad Dog 20/20. That's how bad. In New York, Donald Trump is leasing out his hair as a squirrel condo. That's how bad. The economy is so bad guys are skipping the $20 lap dances, just going out to the airport to get fondled by the TSA agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today at the White House, President Obama met with the President of Mongolia. And of course, Sarah Palin had to chime in. She said her favorite movie of all time is 'Steel Mongolians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A US official still can't say what happened to $6.6 billion that was sent to Iraq, intended for reconstruction, you know? For the start of the war. $6.6 billion is gone. Doesn't that make you mad? That's money we could have wasted and mismanaged right here at home. Why do we have to send it overseas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow marks the 40th anniversary of the war on drugs. Our partners in Mexico will be observing it with a moment of silence, followed by hours of laughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the anniversary of the Great Wall of China. Truly one of the great wonders of the world. And we look at it now and we think, 'What's the deal with those Chinese?' What are they trying to pull? But in all honesty since they put up the wall not one Mexican has sneaked in. Not one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the big news today, Congressman Weiner resigned. You heard about that, right? He resigned. It's sort of a good news/bad news thing. The good news is Congressman Weiner resigned. The bad news, he made the announcement shirtless over Skype.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all see the big Republican debate the other night? Ok then. According to a poll, over 50% of viewers thought Mitt Romney won this week's presidential debate. They thought Mitt Romney won, yeah. Romney credits the win to his grasp of the issues and the good people at Mattel, who built him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Father's Day coming up and according to a new study, American fathers are spending twice as much time with their children as they used to in years past. Isn't that nice? I thought so, yeah. Experts say it's due to a sweeping new trend called unemployment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, huge news, it looks like Congress just lost its Weiner. That's right. After two weeks of scandal, Anthony Weiner announced today that he is resigning from Congress. That's right, one second he's in, the next he's out, typical Weiner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is big. Osama bin Laden's former deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri has officially taken over as leader of Al Qaeda. I know that because today he updated his profile on LinkedIn.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I'm in the CVS drug store today, I'm in the card section. You know they have one whole area of cards, Father's Day cards just for Arnold Schwarzenegger. A whole area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know by now, yesterday Congressman Anthony Weiner resigned from Congress. Resigned in Queens, New York, at a senior citizens center, which is pretty smart. That's the one group who has no idea what Twitter is. No idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the straw that finally broke the camel's back in this whole incident was when a porn star, by the name of Ginger Lee said that she had been getting e-mails from the Congressman. Yeah, that's not good. She said she tried to steer her conversations with Weiner to politics and away from pornography. See politics and pornography that's not easy, I mean, both are about screwing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moving on to other politics, Newt Gingrich now demanding that NBC News apologize to his wife for reporting that his entire campaign staff quit last week because she is too controlling. Actually, he didn't demand the apology, she is demanding that he demand the apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh has come out with his own brand of iced tea which shows rush on a horse dressed up like Paul Revere. Well how confusing is this going to be for Sarah Palin? She must have no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the winners of the Republican ... Did anybody watch the Republican debate? Nobody watched it. The winners are reported to be Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann. Show them at the debate. Here they are at the debate. You know, don't they look like they are married real estate agents you see on the bench bus ads? Show the ads. Take a look. Look. Don't they look like the real estate couple?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I saw Bill Gates stealing sugar packets from Denny's. That's how bad it is. The economy is so bad SpongeBob has taken a second job as a contraceptive. That's how bad it is. Terrible. Economy is so bad I saw Bob Barker on 'The Price is Right' as a contestant. Gary Busey asked all the voices in his head to chip in for gas money. That's how bad the economy is. The economy is so bad in New York, Anthony Weiner just took a job at Hot Dog on a Stick. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the new Al Qaeda leader al Zawahiri will be hunted down and killed just like bin Laden was. They think he may be in Pakistan. They know that because Pakistan said they have no idea where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This al Zawahiri guy has been described as unlikable, petty and irritating. You know, as opposed to the fun-loving, crack-up bin Laden was. See, that's when you need to know to work on your people skills when your fellow murderers and terrorists don't like you. That's not good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Anthony Weiner has stepped down, the state will find his replacement by holding a special election. Weiner was pretty excited. They were like, 'No, a special election. Election, with an 'l.' put your phone away. It's an election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Did you see this in an interview on 'Good Morning America?' President Obama says he's confident that Anthony Weiner will bounce back from his scandal. Great, just what we needed, a bouncing Weiner. That's the last thing we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is good. I just read that more companies are bringing back jobs to the US that have been outsourced to other countries for years. So the next time you call tech support, you might actually get someone who speaks perfect English and knows nothing about computers. 'You want me to reboot your keyboard? Did you unplug it, sir? Try unplugging it.' I don't know why I call these idiots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner had the big golf summit on Saturday. And you know what the President's handicap is? Anybody know? Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, well, the team of Obama and Boehner beat the team of Joe Biden and Ohio governor John Kasich. Yeah. And talk about irony. When they tallied up the score, they were 14 trillion over par.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one really awkward moment for Obama and Boehner in the clubhouse. The guy in the locker room handing out of the towels? Anthony Weiner. ... Don't feel sorry for him. Even though Congressman Weiner has resigned, it turns out his pension from Congress could top $1 million. $1 million. Imagine that. He is leaving Congress with a bigger package than he came in with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now trying to woo back Wall Street as he prepares for the 2012 campaign. Woo back? Did he just give them $800 billion of bailout money? Shouldn't that be enough 'woo' to keep them happy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, parents in Beverly Hills are now being forced to raise their own children. Terrible.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich has a new campaign slogan. Now hiring! Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I'll tell you. The stock market went up a little bit today, but, boy, I'll tell you ... The economy is so bad Wal-Mart greeters are now offering customers happy endings. That's how bad the economy is. It's terrible. The economy is so bad, a rabbi, a priest and minister walk into a bar and then burned it down for the insurance money. That's how bad. In Beverly Hills, I saw Wolfgang Puck eating Chef Boyardee. That's how bad. The economy is so bad, eBay was put up on eBay. That's how bad it was. In Barstow, I saw a sign spinner working outside a meth lab, that's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you who is in a lot of trouble, ladies and gentlemen, Mitt Romney. He's supposedly the Republican presidential contender front-runner.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, and former governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, he's running for president, and he's one of those guys, he can do everything. He speaks Chinese ... In a couple of years we'll all be speaking Chinese. Who cares? What I do care?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry says that if he runs for President, he's ready to fight accusations that he's gay. He says any man who so much asks him if he's gay is going get a good, hard pinch in the butt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's at the center of a big controversy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big economic news. Yesterday, President Obama urged more foreign countries to start investing in the US economy. It was nice. Mexico's president was like, 'The people of Mexico are with you. Literally, they're already there with you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that video from Washington where a crying baby is handed to President Obama? And as soon as the President holds the baby in his arms, it stops crying. Do you know how rare that is these days? A politician is handed a baby from the crowd and it's not his? That never happens. It's amazing. No, but I mean, the baby stopped crying as soon as the President held it. You know, Obama should try that with John Boehner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama announced this week he's going to start sending out his own messages personally on Twitter. But then Anthony Weiner said, 'It's a trap! Don't do it!' President Obama's tweets are different than Anthony Weiner's. Okay? See when Obama sends out pictures of something obscene, it's the unemployment numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, President Obama gave his speech about Afghanistan. He's starting a new phase of the military campaign, Operation Reelection. Yeah. Folks, it's now time for something we call 'Similar, yet completely different.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain in a little bit of hot water after he made an unsubstantiated claim that illegal immigrants caused the Arizona wildfires. Well, now he kind of backtracked today. Now he's saying it was, you know, just the Metamucil talking. No, I guess he made that claim without doing his research. Remember the last time he didn't do his research? We got Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Sarah Palin has canceled the rest of her bus tour of historic America. Remember she was going to travel all around? Pretty smart, though. I guess she figured she'd quit before she got to Mt. Rushmore, and somebody asked her to name the Presidents, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for Newt Gingrich. One week after his entire campaign staff quit, his campaign finance team quit. In fact, Newt was going to try and pull out of the race, but today the guy who wrote his concession speeches quit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to new polls, 66% of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, but the good news is gas is so expensive and traffic is so bad, we won't get there for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have a new Republican candidate for president, former governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman. ... Listen to this, the guy is fluent in Chinese. ... In a short period of time, the Republicans have come quite a long way because you remember the last Republican President of the United States wasn't even fluent in English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Sarah Palin ended her bus tour, reportedly canceling events in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. Yeah. When asked why Palin said it turns out those places are nowhere near each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign is really heating up, though. Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich bragged about his third wife's accomplishments by saying she plays the French horn. Yeah. Things got awkward when he added 'If you know what I mean.' I don't know what he means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry urges his supporters to follow him on Tweeter. Tweeter. Yeah. After hearing about it, John McCain laughed and said, 'What an idiot. It's the Tweeter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jon Huntsman, he's a new guy to talk about. He's got these weird campaign ads. His new campaign ad says 'He's not in it for the balloons.' Yeah. After hearing this, George W. Bush said the balloons are the best part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum once said, 'I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts.' In other words, Santorum has sewn-up the crucial gay people who don't have gay sex vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty cool, President Obama will be in New York tomorrow night for a fund-raiser at the Broadway musical 'Sister Act.' Meanwhile, Sarah Palin will be in town to do some hunting at the 'Lion King.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is big. New York governor Andrew Cuomo will hold a special election on September 13 to replace Anthony Weiner. Cuomo was like, 'Anyone interested in the job should e-mail me at -- actually, just better call. It's better if you just call, that's safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;During a speech last week, Texas governor Rick Perry accidentally referred to Twitter as Tweeter. Perry apologized for the gaffe and asked everyone to friend him on Headbook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with a question. You ever been just fed up, to the breaking point? You think, you know what, enough with the rat race, chasing some materialistic dream. I'm going to chuck it all, sell my stuff, move to a fishing village, drink ouzo, eat lamb all day and charm tourists with my lusty, full-of-life-attitude while existing on a pensioner's stipend. Sounds nice. And it is. Now, what would happen if an entire country had that idea? At the same time. I present to you Greece 2011.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those [Greek] rioters are upset about proposed austerity measures that would end Greek citizen benefits such as six paid vacation weeks a year and retirement with 80% pay and benefits at age 53. And word is the rioting may spread when people find out Greeks get to retire with 80% pay at 53.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece $480 billion debt for 11 million people. You irresponsible children. That is like $44,000 of debt per person. Don't give me, that 'Well, the United States has debt, too.' Yes, yes, we do have a $14 trillion debt, but we have 307 million people, so ours works out to ... What's that? Oh, $45,000 per person. But we get to retire never.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice to have you all here. A little information for folks watching at home, our entire studio office tonight, all people who used to work for Newt Gingrich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you saw the speech last night. President Obama announced the withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan. Yep. He said last night, 'We can't stay there indefinitely.' They've got troops in Korea going, 'Hello, we've been here 60 years. Hello?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama released 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Well, he said it was in response to what he called a real emergency in his poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, now even Al Gore is attacking President Obama. Al Gore says Obama has failed to stand up for bold action and has made little progress in global warming. Then the girl said, 'Sir, if you could just pay for your ice cream, we have other customers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Sarah Palin is now saying she did not quit. She said she ended her bus tour early, because she has jury duty. Which raises an important question. I mean, how can you be smart enough to be President of the United States if you're not smart enough to get out of jury duty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports, poor financial decisions with a Chicago brokerage firm cost Al Qaeda over $20 million in investments. Al Qaeda lost $20 million in the stock market. Why are we risking the lives of our Navy SEALs? Send in Bernie Madoff. He will take care of these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is bad. It's so bad instead of taking it to the dry cleaners, Donald Trump is hand washing his hair in Woolite. The economy is so bad, Wal-Mart considering only selling cheap crap made in America. That's how bad it is. Today, I saw a dog licking himself and charging the other dog five bucks to watch. That's how bad. Two guys went into Hooters just for the food. That's how bad!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush comes out and says 'Okay Osama bin Laden, dead or alive, dead or alive.' Six, seven, eight years go by and George W. Bush says, 'I don't really think about him that much anymore.' Well, okay, that's one way of handling it. And then Barack Obama comes in and sends some SEAL team guys over, guns him down. So they had to replace the guy. They gunned him down and they had to replace that guy, gunned him down. So now I'm happy to announce that the new head of Al Qaeda is Iman al-Zawahiri. Or as he's known to SEAL Team 6, 'Next.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But right now Zawahiri is in what they call that brief honeymoon period. He'll be in kind of a brief period of goodwill, a honeymoon period and then he'll be shot in the head. That's how you know the honeymoon's over. But they say and I don't know who they are but they say that Zawahiri lacks charisma. Lacks charisma and I think, 'Well duh! Hello! Not everybody can be a people person like bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Sarah Palin said that she read Bristol Palin's new book and she found it shocking. Yeah. When asked what was shocking, Palin said, 'The fact that I read a book.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled that makers of generic drugs cannot be sued for inadequate labeling on their products. Yeah, they can't be sued if you put inadequate labels on. In fact, all they have to say is this will do something to your cholesterol level and/or penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big news here in New York City, President Obama went to a Broadway show tonight, while Justin Bieber was only a few blocks away from Macy's. It was a crazy scene, you had the most powerful man in the world, and then right down the street, President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama was in New York today. There was one embarrassing moment when he saw the Naked Cowboy and was like, 'Please tell me you're not a Democratic Congressman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Sarah Palin is denying reports her bus tour is canceled, and says it will resume when the time comes. So there you go, everyone. It's not canceled, not cancelled, she just stopped doing it, and has no specific plans to start again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid attacked Mitt Romney for constantly contradicting himself. In response, Romney was like, 'You know what, I am very angry. No, I am not. Now, I am, now, I definitely am not angry. Yes, I am.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York State, Governor Cuomo legalized gay marriage and I think it's great for everybody, honestly. Especially divorce lawyers, you know what I mean? But with marriage, responsibility. And I'm sure gay people, members of this community, are aware of the responsibility of marriage. You've got to make decisions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Wallace over there at Fox News. He asked Michele Bachmann, he said, 'Are you a flake?' and I thought to call Michele Bachmann a flake is to insult the fine folks at Kellogg's. I mean, honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, remember Rod Blagojevich? Former governor from Illinois? Rod Blagojevich was on the program a couple of years ago and he walked around telling everybody 'Hi, I'm innocent. I'm innocent. Do you think I'm innocent? Do I look guilty? No, I'm innocent.' Well, today he was found guilty of 17 counts. ... He's looking at 300 years in prison. He was charged with corruption and unlawful imprisonment of a badger. Have you seen his hair? Look, right there. Governor Blagojevich said he was stunned by the verdict. I said 'Well, apparently you weren't paying attention to the trial.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what started this, Blagojevich was accused of trying to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat when he was elected President. ... And I was thinking, 'I bet the President wouldn't mind giving up his seat now!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was in Iowa today to attend the premiere of her new documentary about her and it's called 'The Undefeated.' Undefeated. Sarah Palin, your [bleep] lost in 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin and Todd went to the premiere together. Halfway through the movie, Todd wanted to sneak out to go see 'Transformers III,' but realized he was already sitting next to something that turns into a robot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truly astonishing part of this story is Rod Blagojevich is the fourth out of the last seven elected governors of Illinois to be convicted of a felony. Four out of the last seven. 57%. If you were an individual in Illinois, you would have a better chance of avoiding jail by flipping a coin, heads being jail, tails being no jail, than by being elected governor of Illinois. Let's say you're the present governor of Illinois and you're in a room with a former governor of Illinois on your right and a former governor of Illinois on your left. Chances are the room you're in is jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Bristol Palin says she knows if her mother is running, but she can't say anything.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin tonight with the economy, which, as many of you are aware, sucks. Right now we're looking to pay down $14.3 trillion of debt. [Audience reacts] Apparently, I'm reading a scary story to my children. They're going to do all the noises like it's 'Peter and the [bleeped] Wolf' or something. We're going to pay down $14. Trillion of debt with a economy struggling to produce jobs, in large part because American workers still stubbornly cling to the idea that they should be more highly compensated than say suicidal Chinese computer part factory help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh. Well, you know there's only two ways to reduce the deficit. You can cut spending or raise taxes. You take one of those off the table completely, you're not really negotiating. It's like saying, 'I would do anything for love, but I won't do that.' You really wouldn't then do anything for love. So I guess what I'm saying, is Meatloaf's premise is faulty is what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And folks, it's all the more historic because of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, which allowed the creation of super-PACs, political action committees that can take unlimited corporate and union cash to create political ads. Months ago I announced my plans to set up Colbert Super-PAC. Our motto: Making a better tomorrow, tomorrow. In fact, when you Google the phrase 'Super-Pac.' I'm the first five results.

I guess it's pretty hard to catch them. For some reason, nobody could put two and two together. You know who gets hurt by something like this? The kids. The kids are the ones that get hurt. Because they are never going to learn how to cheat on their own. Do you know what I'm saying? When they get jobs on Wall Street and become lawyers, they are not going to know how to lie and cheat and steal properly. It's a horrible thing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Republican presidential front-runner Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum are committed to a family values pledge. They say they will ban all pornography. You know what that means? This could end life in the San Fernando Valley as we know it, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a southern California county supervisor is proposing that the state of California split into two separate states. Come on, how bad would that be? Do you like that idea? Have people from the other California sneaking into our California looking for work. It would be worse than it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Zogby poll, US popularity in the Middle East is now at an all-time low. Really? An all-time low? I mean, how could it be lower than before? Remember? It was 'Death to America.' Can you get lower? What, are they putting a thumb tack on our seat now? What else could it be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news for President Obama. In the last three months, his re-election campaign raised $86 million. The bad news, to get re-elected, he's got to come up with $14 trillion more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, starting next year, all US savings bonds will be electronic instead of printed. All our bonds will soon be paperless as well as valueless, useless, and worthless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Moody investor services now put the US bond rating under review. We could lose our AAA rating. They're thinking of changing it from AAA to LOL.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Michele Bachmann, this woman, say what you will about her but she is outspoken and deadly earnest. She says if she was elected President she will ban gay marriage and pornography. Pornography? And she calls herself a Republican?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, August 1st if they don't raise the debt limit the earth explodes. So John Boehner and President Obama are haggling and it's like a trillion dollars. They're fighting, squabbling. They've got to get the money and the trillion dollars 'Do you want a trillion?' 'Yes, but can I' 'No, you can't have a trillion.' 'What are we going to do with this?' I mean honest to God it's like a Tiger Woods divorce settlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ohio Congressman Bill Johnson says his Twitter account was hacked yesterday after an image of a naked man was posted on his page. You know what they say, when the Lord taketh a Weiner, he then giveth a Johnson. That's right. Congressman Johnson says someone hacked his account and posted a naked picture. When asked for comment, Anthony Weiner said, 'Hacked? Good luck, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I just read this, the Treasury Department is shifting from paper to electronic savings bonds next year. Don't worry, the electronic bonds will be just as worthless as the paper ones. That will be worth $20 if you wait 10 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On reports Obama stormed out of a debt meeting] &quot;Oh, no, he didn't. The President stormed out and was like, 'Okay, tomorrow then.' What? That's not storming out. That's ending a meeting by scheduling the next meeting. And I got to say, if that's Obama mad, that's weak. He's still so in control. You get the sense if he were the Hulk, when he felt his anger causing the transformation; he would just excuse himself to change into a bigger suit, as to not needlessly shred a perfectly good outfit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain has criticized Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann for saying that she would vote against any effort to raise the debt ceiling.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, starting to get tough. He said he's reached his limit. He will not give in on his debt ceiling position, even if it costs him his Presidency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new Gallup Poll if the election were held tomorrow, a no-name Republican would beat President Obama. And today, Tim Pawlenty said 'A no-name Republican, that's me. I could win. You mean I'm the new President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in last night's 50th Annual Congressional Baseball Game, the Democrats beat the Republicans 8-2.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week in an interview with ABC News, President Obama said that he will turn 50 this week. But the truth is he turns 50 August 4th. So you know what that means? Apparently, even he hasn't seen his real birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, says he believes that God is calling on him to run for President, but he said he hasn't decided whether to do it or not.

But she says they're under control with medicine and it won't affect her ability to campaign. So, the good news for her supporters, she continues to fight against all those government programs. You know why she's able to do it? Because she's got that really good government health care plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's 50th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks. If you're thinking of getting him something, he could use about $14 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Iowa over the weekend, Congressman Leonard Boswell fought off an intruder who broke into his home and ran away. That's pretty scary. The guy broke into his home and ran away. The guy got away, because of the confusion. I guess someone yelled 'Stop, thief.' And people naturally grabbed the Congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's your Federal government at work. Listen to this. The FAA has ordered a helicopter pilot, who runs his own one pilot charter company -- he's the whole company. ... One pilot, just him. They've ordered him to give himself random, surprise drug tests. He has to surprise himself with a drug test. The only way can you do that is if you're on drugs, wouldn't you say? That's the only way that would work. Otherwise, there's no surprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So hot here, this is how hot it is in New York City. This is true. It is so hot today that Anthony Weiner got in bed with his wife just for the chill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot everywhere on the East Coast, hot down in Washington, listen to this. This is kind of funny. They thought they had a budget deal down in Washington earlier today. It turned out to be a mirage. The heat, that's the heat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann the Republican candidate for President, she suffers from migraines ... She apparently gets these disabling headaches from time to time and I thought, 'Wait a minute, oh that is what happens when you don't get a little pornography every now and then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Rick Santorum says he has a Google problem because when you Google his name he says it brings up an obscene term. Tim Pawlenty also has a problem. He said when you Google his name it says 'no results found.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a couple of people who work for presidential candidate Michele Bachmann say she gets migraines. That's been the story. And to derail her candidacy, a lot of people are trying to make it look like a female thing, because she gets headaches. It's not. President Obama also has a chronic headache. It's called Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for former Senator John Edwards. An audit of his campaign finances shows he now owes the Federal government $2.3 million. Apparently spent the money on everything except condoms. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's motorcade has been fined $16 by the city of London for the traffic congestion his car caused during his visit to England. 16 bucks, yeah. Typical Obama, when asked to pay the fine, he said, 'Ah, my grandkids will take care of it. Put it on the tab!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what happened this week? The 42nd anniversary of the first moon landing. I think it was yesterday. Despite all the budget cuts, President Obama said today he would still like to send men to the moon, John Boehner, Glenn Beck, Mitch McConnell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know anything about the debt crisis and the debt ceiling limit? Do you understand what that means? That they're going to raise it, they're not going to raise it. Do you know, do you understand? Don't lie to me. Nobody knows. Nobody knows what they're talking about. But they say that because of this trouble, we may lose our AAA rating. And I say 'Yeah, well, why don't you tell the auto club to mind their own business.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Bachmann the presidential candidate, her husband believes you can pray away the gay. Actually it's a combination of prayer and show tunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Michele Bachman says if she's elected President she's going to outlaw gay marriage and also make it illegal for Neil Patrick Harris to host the Tonys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So here's how Michele Bachman's husband claims that he can cure homosexuality. Here's what they do. They get you into the clinic. Hi, come on, you do some paperwork. And then while you're in there, if you display an urge to go antiquing, they taser you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the Senate held hearings on gay marriage. And one Senator who supporting gay rights actually quoted Abraham Lincoln. He said Lincoln would have been friendly to gays because he had a beard and lived his last moments in the theater.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;House speaker John Boehner invited new Congressmen over for pizza last night. Unfortunately, the delivery guy left when they spent 10 hours fighting over a plan to pay for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new study found that only 20% of high school seniors are proficient in geography. Yeah, students weren't really bothered by that number because only 3% of them are proficient in math. It didn't bother them at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TGIF stands for the ground is frying! Oh, man, back east, this heat wave put such a strain on electricity use on the East Coast, they are having more rolling blackouts than David Hasselhoff ... It was so hot in Washington, Newt Gingrich went braless. That never happens! It was so hot in Iowa Michele Bachmann couldn't tell if the headache was a migraine or brain freeze from a Slurpee. She wasn't sure. It was so hot in Barstow, even trailers without meth labs were exploding. That's how hot it was. That's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, officials in London have fined President Obama $193 for not paying a $16 traffic fee he was owed after his last visit. How scared does that make the Chinese, huh? We can't pay England 16 bucks? How are we going to pay them the $14 trillion dollars we owe them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is not looking good. President Obama got pretty emotional, pretty mad, earlier tonight. He could not work out a deal. Republicans walked out. He couldn't work it out. Less than two weeks, US government defaults and the Federal Reserve announced it is now working on a plan to determine who gets paid first. You know something? I think we all agree. I don't care who gets paid first, just so Congress gets paid last.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And still no agreement on the NFL dispute. Hey, at least the football players have an excuse. They suffer from multiple concussions, you know? I mean, what's the politicians' excuse? Okay, they don't have a backbone. But that shouldn't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has fired his campaign manager. Which is kind of sad. 'Cause the only other person knew Huntsman was running for President was the campaign manager.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Congressman Anthony Weiner, remember him? The Peter tweeter? You all know him. He is now getting treatment. ... According to the 'New York Post,' Anthony Weiner said he not only has to worry about his wife. Not just his wife to worry about, but worry about his wife's boss, who is Hillary Clinton. He has to convince Hillary Clinton he's cured. To which Bill said, 'Hey, good luck with that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FAA ordered a helicopter pilot who runs his own one-man charter company, he's the only guy in the whole company, he has to give himself random surprise drug tests. This is true. Since he's the pilot, he has to give himself these surprise tests. To make sure he doesn't cheat, he has to watch himself pee into a little cup to make sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TSA has announced that new software for screening machines at US airports will no longer show the passengers' naked image. However, they will keep the candles and the mood lighting for the pat-downs. So that's nice. The soft music.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is still no deal on this stupid debt ceiling thing. You know, each party is perusing its own special plan. One called for the American people to get hosed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And House Speaker John Boehner said, 'I don't know, it may be pretty hard to put humpty dumpty back together again.' That's what he said. That's shows you how out of touch Boehner is. Why is he quoting children's books? Bush is not President anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the Democrats and Republicans meeting over the weekend? Show that footage. Okay, now take a look. ... There is Harry Reid, there's Mitch McConnell. Freeze it right there! Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell can't agree on a budget? They obviously agree on everything else. Look at them. Same hair, same glasses, same sports coat, same shirt! Why can't you agree on this?! They look like the Doublemint twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know folks, we are literally days away from running out of money. Here's my question, how can we be out of money? What happened to all the money we gave them April 15th? Remember that? That's just three months ago. Wasn't that supposed to last all year? You know something? Hey, if they want more money, I want to see receipts. Okay? I want to see receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems 56-year-old Oregon Congressman David Wu, remember him? He's the Congressman who sent staffers pictures of himself dressed as a tiger? ... Well, he's now been accused of making inappropriate sexual advances to the teenage daughter of a friend. A teenager! What is with these Democrats? If it's not Weiner's weiner, it's Wu's wang. What is going on? And you know, I tell you something. There were signs of this guy. Did you see his campaign slogan, 'Wu's your daddy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty has been on the campaign trail a little over a year now and his percentage of the vote has risen from 1% to 2%. In a year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know gay marriages now legal here in New York City. And now it's not Michele Bachmann's who has the migraines. Now it's her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mom and I play a drinking game. You know the drinking games? We do a shot every time the debt talks collapse. And just about now Obama, the President, I mean I'm telling you, this guy, now he wishes he was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is the latest because Republicans won't agree on President Obama's proposal on raising debt ceiling, the President may have to cancel his 50th birthday party. Yeah, so it's worse than we thought. Republicans won't even let Obama raise his age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say that because of the debt ceiling debate, America's credit rating could be seriously ruined. This is true, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll that just came out, less than half of Americans know that Mitt Romney is a Mormon. Yeah. In fact, some of his wives don't even know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, you guys. After months of negotiations, a deal has been reached to end the NFL lockout. Or as China put it, 'Oh, great. Glad you got that deal worked out. Any word on the $14 trillion? Yeah. You might want to get working on that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;On ABC's 'This Week,' a guest said Rick Perry won't win the presidency because after eight years of Bush, there's a 'Texas taint.' In related news, I just received a $10,000 fine from the FCC for saying that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Saw that Sarah Palin's documentary 'The Undefeated' will be available on pay-per-view and On Demand by September 1st. The movie will be shown in English with English subtitles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is still $14 trillion in debt. Can you feel ourselves leaking oil as a country? Listen, if this isn't resolved by next Tuesday, the government won't be able to pay its bills. It's gotten so bad, when the phone rings at the White House, Obama has his mother-in-law answer. 'He's not here. No. I haven't seen him. You know what, you might try Kenya.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>

He needs us. ... And if he loses, he's learning how to do drywall just in case. Just in case. Republican candidates were also invited to speak. They declined. You know why they declined? They were too busy building a giant wall around the entire conference. With a permit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is still no resolution to this stupid debt ceiling crisis. You know, Iowa Congressman Stephen King says if President Obama allows the country to be default, he could be impeached. Obama could stop that with three words, 'President Joe Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' some experts say August 2nd may not be the drop-dead date for the debt ceiling. They said the US might have a week or possibly longer. A week? How pathetic is that? We used to be the most powerful country in the world. Now we are like a crack head who robbed a minimart. 'I got another week worth of money. A week, I'm good. I'm good. I've got it. Here's my watch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-six year-old Oregon Congressman David Wu now coming under fire for allegedly making unwanted advances towards a teenage girl. Is that why he's dressed like a tiger? How young are these girls? Where does he pick them up, Chuck E. Cheese? What is that? How creepy is that? Well, now Congressman Wu is being forced to resign. The moral of this story, never try to 'woo' a much younger woman, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican presidential candidate John Huntsman has fired his campaign manager Susan Willie. This after polls show she had a higher name recognition than he did. Yeah, that was not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the entire town of Scenic, South Dakota, is for sale for $799,000. You buy the whole city. Twelve acres, has a saloon, post office, and 15 Starbucks. Yeah, that's a good deal. That's not unusual, buying an entire city. People have been doing that for years. It's called Washington, DC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the NFL lockout is over. All parties compromised. Everybody agreed and now we have a solution. It's too bad the national debt is not as important as football, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;August 2 the United States government runs out of money. Do you folks have something put away? You better have something. They may have to stop paying Captain America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great news, the Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann who's running for President? When she and her husband Marcus heard there was trouble with the debt Marcus jumped in and offered to pray away the debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jeb Bush could be running for President in 2012. Jeb Bush. You know, to me Bush Presidencies are like 'Caddyshack' movies. They should have stopped at one, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said that compromise has become a dirty word. Then he told Republicans to go compromise themselves. It was good. No, the US government is one week away now, one week away from running out of money to pay its bills. So basically our nation has become Nicolas Cage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's weighing in on what to do. Donald Trump says he has the solution. Donald Trump said the GOP should let the US default in order to prevent President Obama's re-election. Trump said, 'Trust me on this, I go bankrupt all the time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday 300-pound governor Chris Christie stated he's not going run for President. He liked the President part but not the running part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this fight over the debt is still going on. Today the White House said that House Republicans won't give an inch on the debt ceiling. I don't know about you but personally, I think we've heard enough about Congressmen and their inches, all right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;On CNN, Tim Pawlenty accused President Obama of hiding in the basement during debt ceiling talks. While Joe Biden accused President Obama of locking him in the basement during debt ceiling talks. [ As Obama ] 'Stay down there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night President Obama spoke to the nation, riveting, like in the old days. 'Yes, we can.' People were inspired. They picked up the phones. The Congressional switch board lit up with calls, most of them saying, 'Hey, put the Bachelorette' back on. I am missing 'Antique Road Show' for that? The President spoke for 15 minutes. It was supposed to be 30, but we are so broke, they cut the lights-out on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I got invited to the President's birthday party. Next Thursday, this is how broke we are. It is BYOB. No cake, nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama welcomed the world champion San Francisco Giants to the White House yesterday. He asked them, 'Do you think you can repeat?' The Giants asked him the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we begin, of course, with our ongoing national crisis. One week, ladies and gentlemen, for our two parties to agree to raise the country's arbitrary debt limit for the 102nd time for the drop-dead August 2 catastrophic ultimatum we've already moved twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the Presidential Address] &quot;You know, I think your financial austerity path message may be slightly undercut by the golden-chaired red carpet path you walked down to tell us about it. Isn't there any way to do the 'tighten the belt speech' from a room that doesn't look like the foyer of the Vatican? Just saying, if Willy Wonka had to address America's chocolate shortage, he might not do it from the waterfall room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right. So massive cuts to government spending. No surprise coming from the Republicans. What's that? Oh, that's the Democrats' plan. What the [bleep] has been going on down there?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie in the country, 'Captain America.' You know what's interesting; analysts say this movie's successful because it takes place in the '40s. It has what they call a retro feel. See the film takes the audiences back to a time when America would actually fight a war and get out of a depression at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest Rasmussen Poll, a record 46% of Americans think most of Congress is corrupt. The other 54% think they're extremely corrupt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his address the other night, the President urged Americans to call Congress and pressure them to make a deal. And after his address, the capitol got 40,000 calls in the first hour. Forty thousand. There were so many calls, Rupert Murdoch's people could barely listen in on all of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, President Obama is losing support from his own party. You want to know how bad it is? Today Jimmy Carter compared him to Jimmy Carter. That's how bad it's gotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, economists are now worried that if we fall into default, then the good name of the United States would suffer in the eyes of the world. Oh, shut up. Okay? We lost that fight the day we sent the cast of 'Jersey Shore' to Italy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, to save money the US Post Office announced they're closing 3,700 post offices all across the country. The goal, to create one enormously long line of people waiting to be served by a single window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, when you hear your name called, do me a favor, come up here on stage and tell us about your debt-reduction plan. I don't understand anything about the thing. Do you? Anybody? Of course you don't. The debt, we are over $14 trillion in debt. But listen to this, the 'feels like' is $20 trillion. That's the key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that woman running for the President, the Republican, Michele Bachmann. Do you know her? They did this investigating and found this woman spends over $5,000 a week, $5,000 a week on hair and makeup. Yup. And so does her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a week now and we don't know if we're going to pay our bills or not. We don't know what's going to happen. No one here seems to care. It's getting crazy. The US government now has -- I think it's less than one week away from running out of money to pay its bills. That is official. Things are so bad, folks, America may have to move in with Canada for a while. Let's go over there at 4:00 in the morning. We got kicked out. We didn't pay our bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at a fundraising dinner in Virginia, Mitt Romney said one of the people he would consider as his running mate is 300-pound New Jersey governor Chris Christie. After hearing about it Chris Christie said it's great but tell me more about the dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this debt crisis still isn't solved, but yesterday the White House said it's working on a Plan B. Unfortunately the 'B' stands for bake sale. Plan C is car wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Speaking of the debt crisis, I read that if the US debt were stacked into 100 dollar bills it would be as long as two football fields and as high as the Statue of Liberty. You know, just in case $14 trillion didn't seem like a lot to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's talk that John Boehner and Harry Reid are offering a special plan that would raise the debt ceiling for just 30 days. And after that you receive a new debt plan every month from one of your favorite Congressman. If at any time you want to cancel, just send back the old debt plan free of charge. Does not include shipping and handling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Big, big story. It's rumored that Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton are friends again. There you have it. Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton are now more mature than President Obama and John Boehner. Isn't that interesting? You can learn a lot from those kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, the fallout from the housing crisis continues. This week it was revealed that the Justice Department is investigating Wells Fargo bank for allegedly steering African-American borrowers with good credit to subprime mortgages. Which explains Wells Fargo's short-lived spokesman Sir Owes-a-Lot. [rapping] 'He likes big debts, and he can apply! You other brothers can't deny, when a banker walks in with an itty-bitty rate and a big loan in your face, you get sprung!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only 17% of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction, which makes me think it might be time for a woman President. See, at least a woman would stop and ask for directions. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an ABC News poll, 77% of Americans blame Republican leaders for the upcoming default and 58% blame President Obama. There is a problem right there 77% and 58% is 135%, okay. How can we balance the budget? We can't even add up a poll number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I don't understand; the Republicans have cut cap-and-balance. That's no good. Of course, Democrats have their plan, duck-and-cover. That doesn't work either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at a White House GOP meeting the other night, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy tried to inspire everybody by showing a clip from the movie 'The Town.' You think that's the best movie for Congress? 'The Town.' How many think 'Dumb and Dumber' would be a better movie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey governor Chris Christie is recovering after being rushed to the hospital when he said he couldn't breathe. A doctor said it's from the condition called 'living in New Jersey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities in New York city have shut down what they call a ring of high-end prostitutes working on Wall Street. Prostitutes working on Wall Street. So, at least you know not all the bailout money was wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after two weeks in theaters, the documentary about Sarah Palin called 'The Undefeated' not doing well. It barely made $100,000. I'm not saying Sarah Palin's movie is a bomb, but today Al Qaeda tried to take credit. So they are now claiming that they actually produced the film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is great news. George Bush who was President and George Bush's father, Herbert Walker Bush, he was also President. Now the son and the brother Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, is saying that he has not ruled out running for President in 2012. And coincidentally I have not ruled out drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government is just a few days from running out of money to pay its bills. Unbelievable. Congress' latest plan is to see how much cash they can get for John McCain on 'Antiques Road Show.' I don't know. He is not going to like being turned upside down to find his mark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debt crisis is still a mess. In fact, this week President Obama held a conference call with college students who are worried about the debt ceiling. Yeah, the call started like this 'You have a collect call from Barack Obama. Will you accept the charges?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And listen to this. House Democrats want President Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment, which would let him raise the debt ceiling on his own. Or as most people put it, 'Wait, you could have done that the whole time? What are you waiting for, Buster?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House John Boehner told fellow Republicans, 'Get your asses in line and support me.' I'm all for Republicans getting their asses in line, as long as it's the unemployment line!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy TGIF. Must mean 'The Government Is Failing.' That's what it means. The government is failing. As they say in Washington, if it ain't broke, it will be by Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know if this debt limit thing isn't lifted by midnight next Tuesday, President Obama is going to switch to Plan B, a nationwide going out of business sale. Everything 50% off. All government buildings. All parks. Everything must go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And rough night last night for John Boehner, had a kidney stone, couldn't pass that either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, concerning the debt ceiling issue, today Andrea Mitchell said that President Obama was wrong to urge the American people to contact their Representatives in Congress. Oh, yeah. There is one thing politicians of Congress hate is being told what to do by the people who put them there. You know? Hey, corporations pay good money for these Congressmen, they shouldn't have to listen to a bunch of idiotic voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, New Jersey governor Chris Christie released from the hospital today. Good news. I guess he had some blockage or something. But, he told reporters he feels fabulous. He said he feels fabulous and when Michele Bachmann's husband heard that, he said 'We have a clinic that can cure you of that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie 'Cowboys and Aliens' came out today. 'Cowboys and Aliens,' or as Republicans call that, Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Some big election news. It's rumored that Sarah Palin will announce her presidential campaign at a Labor Day rally in Iowa. Yeah. Palin has a great speech planned. She's like, 'We have to do this as a team. Remember, there is no 'I' in Iowa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I read that New Jersey governor Chris Christie...had to go to the hospital for an asthma attack yesterday. Don't worry, he's doing fine. But the guy who lifted him onto the stretcher now has a hernia. So that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And finally, President Obama and Republicans in Congress continue to fight over an agreement that would raise the nation's debt ceiling. You know, I was gonna make a joke about this story but I think it needs to be slow jammed. ... [singing] Can't get no sleep at night because of all that moaning and groaning on Capitol Hill. Obama's on his knees begging for compromising positions you know what they say anytime Democrats and Republicans come together someone's getting screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, a lot of political analysts are saying that Congress was pushed to act on this whole debt ceiling thing before they start their annual five-week recess later this month. Don't you love that? I mean the last couple of weeks, Congressmen have been saying 'Oh, screw the country, screw the stock market, the hell with interest rates.' But as soon as it cuts into their vacation time, 'We've got to get this thing done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the deal is what they call a two-step deal. It steps on the middle class and lower class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it cuts spending by over $2 trillion without raising taxes on the rich. No more taxes for the rich. In fact, today Obama changed his slogan from 'Yes we can,' to 'Yes we cave.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a lot of Democrats are happy about this deal. Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri called this deficit deal a 'Satan sandwich.' A Satan sandwich. Doesn't that sound like some kind of party at Charlie Sheen's house? 'Hey girls, come on over and do a little Satan's sandwich, you know what I'm saying?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, we aren't out of the woods yet on this thing. Moody's Investors Services still put the US bond rating on review. They say we can lose our AAA rating. Here is my question. How do we still have a AAA rating? We have a $1.5 trillion deficit, we have $14 trillion in debt, we have $50 trillion in unfunded liabilities. We still have a credit rating? You know, I was late on a phone bill once, and denied a mortgage. How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad the inscription on the Statue of Liberty now says, 'You were better off where you came from.' The economy is so bad, the manager of the Olive Garden said 'Hey, hey, take it easy on the bread sticks. Take it easy.' The economy is so bad, on the 'Today Show', Kathie Lee and Hoda were chugging cough syrup. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Obama turns 50 this week. If you'd like to get him a gift, he is registered at Bed, Bath and Can I Still Blame Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thirty-three Mexican soldiers were returned to Mexico after they accidentally crossed the US border. Can you blame them? They accidentally wandered into a poor, financially unstable country where most people speak Spanish? How are they supposed to know? They couldn't tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Mexican government, the unemployment rate in Mexico is so low, 4.9%, illegal immigrants in the US are now moving back to Mexico to escape our 9.4% unemployment. See, Obama is a genius. He has solved the illegal immigration problem. There is a method to all of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great news for American taxpayers, President Obama and Congress have reached a deal. ... So what happened? The best I can understand it and believe me I don't understand it. Obama reached a compromise with the Republicans. I think it's the same kind of compromise Custer had with Sitting Bull. Same kind of compromise. Not what the Arapahos had in mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tea Party is unhappy with the deal. Apparently everything they want is not enough. That's the problem. Everything they want. Not enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama was very emotional about this. He said, 'Look, if we don't get this done the credit rating of the United States of America could drop to AA.' Could drop from AAA to AA. I of course, say who cares what a brunch of drunks think? Who cares!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's birthday is this week. Did you know that? It's the President's birthday. He said what he wants for his birthday is a deal on the national debt. That's what he wants, yeah. In a related story, Michelle Obama is at the Apple store trying to buy a $4 trillion iTunes gift card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like there is a tentative deal to actually settle the debt ceiling. Isn't that nice? They actually have a tentative deal. The details, the deal reached by President Obama and congressional leaders would raise the debt ceiling until the year 2013. That's the big news. Yeah. And wait a minute. Here is the best part. It prevents another Smurfs movie until the year 2014.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi had said John Boehner had gone over to the dark side, which for Boehner means he fell asleep in the tanning booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Congressman Cleaver called the debt ceiling bill a 'sugar-coated Satan sandwich,' to which a spokesman for Denny's replied, 'Hey, don't drag our new sandwich into this. It's a good sandwich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We finally have a deal on the debt ceiling. But get this, Democratic Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver is referring to the plan as a 'sugar-coated Satan sandwich.' Or as Americans put it, 'Sugar-coated? Yum, I'll take six, please. That sounds good. Satan sandies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats and Republicans were able to agree to raise the debt limit showing once again that when push comes to shove, our government can come together and decide to help out rich white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new budget, they are going to cut social programs. The only people of color who came out financially ahead this weekend, the Smurfs. They didn't show them in Arizona, because they don't like brown or blue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, July was the hottest month on record in Washington. The hottest it has ever been in recorded history. See, when you're in Washington, it's not the heat that gets to you, it's the stupidity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like President Obama will turn 50 years old on Thursday. Today, Congress agreed to raise his age ceiling, so we're going to go forward. He will be 50. That will happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Moody's, you know that investment company? They now say that even though we've raised the debt ceiling, they may still downgrade our credit rating. To give an idea how bad our credit is, President Obama asked China for another loan. He has to get his mother-in-law to co-sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, for months, the Democrats said they would only go along with spending cuts that hurt the middle class if the wealthy were also asked to share the burden. Now, of course the Democrats wimped out. You hear their answer? 'We asked the wealthy, but they said no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and after the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, he said it's time for jobs to move to the front burner. You know, the only time these guys are worried about our jobs is when they're about to lose their jobs. Have you noticed that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report has found that adults in Washington, DC, are among the top users of cocaine in the country. Hence the name, District of Columbia. The study found that Washington, DC residents were the top abusers of alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. See, all this time we thought the problem was government waste, no, no, the government's wasted. That's the whole problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we're all breathing easier because they got that thing in Washington solved, you know what I'm talking about, the debt ceiling nonsense. Anybody understand that? No? Make any difference to you? No, me neither. They say we avoided economic disaster. Economic disaster, whoo. So now we're $16 trillion in debt. That's not economic disaster?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden, Vice President Joe Biden has now gone on record, he referred to the Tea Party as terrorists. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a real slap in the face to terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like our debt crisis is over. I was tired of that. Yep, today the President signed the debt ceiling bill into law, that's the big story. Yep. Democrats hate it. Republicans hate it. So I guess it can't be that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was relieved. He said now he can get back to the serious issue of whether or not I was born in this country. Finally, something that we can talk about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Thank you for joining us. Folks, the 2012 Election is upon us, and I love a good horse race. I like to go with the candidate who looks like he's been gelded. That's why I'm saddling up Newt Gingrich. I really think he's the guy. And though some of the members of the lame-stream media have counted him out, Newt knows he's got something the other candidates don't. Saying, quote: 'I have six times as many Twitter followers as all the other candidates combined.' Yes, Newt has won the coveted voting bloc of bored people at work. Newt's got 1.3 million followers, while Bachmann's has only 66,000, Mitt Romney has 63,000, and Ron Paul has 'What's a Twitter? Is this how I eBay?' Forget polls, this is the most important indicator of an electable President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, today President Obama signed the debt ceiling compromise. And America narrowly avoided a catastrophe: Giving the Democrats anything they want. Because the only way this bill was two-sided was that the Dems had to take it at both ends. Got that image in the old mind, don't you? Got that image right up here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well folks, in just 20 minutes or so it will be President Obama's birthday. He'll be 50 years old, barring any last minute objections from Donald Trump, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say 50 is the new 30. Not in age, money. Fifty bucks, now worth about 30 bucks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama signed that new debt bill into law. But you know, it doesn't really solve the problem. Economists say in 10 years, the deficit will be $27 trillion. But you know what? In 10 years, that'll be President Bieber's problem, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, are you happy we didn't default? See, people cheer. That's how low our standards are now in this country. Avoiding a disaster is now an accomplishment. We used to go to the moon, remember that? Now we're like, 'Oh, we crashed the car, but it didn't explode, yeah! High five, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell this bill that President Obama signed was not popular with the Democrats either, because he signed it in private. It wasn't one of those big photo ops in the Rose Garden, everybody trying to get in the picture. In fact, this time there was no photographer at all. Obama had to press the timer and then run back to his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 33 Mexican soldiers were returned to Mexico this week, after they accidentally crossed the US border. But you know, it wasn't entirely their fault. They had no idea there was a border. 'What? Huh? What are you talking about?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Omaha, Nebraska, police shut down a four-year-old girl's lemonade stand because she didn't have the necessary licenses and permits. She's four. Well, in response, the girl moved her entire operation to India. Yeah, she said the regulations here were killing her. She couldn't make any money, so now she's over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to talk about this, some drama in Washington yesterday. Did you hear what happened? Yeah, yesterday a man jumped the White House fence. Did you hear that? Yeah, but after a brief chase, Secret Service was able to talk President Obama into coming back and continuing his term. He was mad. I wouldn't blame him for running away at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Obama celebrated his 50th birthday tonight in Chicago. That's right. Yep. Obama cut the cake, then Republicans cut everything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;While eating at a burger place today, President Obama gave a free milkshake to an 11-year-old boy. Not to be nice, he just wanted to get rid of it when he saw Michelle coming. 'Quick, take these cigarettes too. You shouldn't smoke and drink milkshakes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Birthday President Obama. Fifty years old today. It is hard to believe, just a year ago he was in his 40s and his approval ratings was in the 50s, now it's the other way around. Amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was no birthday party, or at least that's what they told Joe Biden. Actually, they had a nice party for him in Chicago. Big party. It was kind of ironic too at the party. The richest one percent of the guests took 42% of the cake. That was kind of interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because it's the big 5-0, the White House released his vital numbers. They say his cholesterol was 209, blood pressure's 105 over 62. The number's that's really gonna kill him, unemployment 9.4. That's the bad one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama told his supporters last night at the party, 'We've got al Qaeda on the run.' So apparently al Qaeda was in the stock market, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five hundred points it dropped today. It's unbelievable. Well, it's mostly due to the fear that the debt crisis in Europe is getting worse. And several European nations are trying to borrow money from China. And Obama got tough, he told them, 'Hey, China is our sugar daddy. You get your own. You get your own! That's right!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, they say because of our national debt, every child born in this country owes $50,000. And China had a message to those kids, today said 'We're hiring! Come on down! Yeah, make sneakers!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market's in bad shape. The market is so bad I called my broker, I said, 'Jump, you bastard!' That's how bad. The market is so bad, Mila Kunis is now looking for friends with pension benefits. That's how bad. The stock market is so bad, the 'Twilight' kids are biting peoples necks and then selling it to the blood banks. That's how bad. The stock market is so bad, today Tobey Maguire and A-Rod switched from poker to go fish. They can't afford poker! The market is so bad, Chris Hansen had to dump one of his mistresses. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday today to President Barack Obama. Fifty years old today. Barack Obama. Whether you like him, whether you don't like him, whether you voted for him, didn't vote for him. It's still a tremendous success story. When you think about it, this guy Barack Obama, born in a hut in Kenya, rose up to be President of the United States. He got some lovely presents. And what can you really get for the President. But he got some lovely things. China gave him an extension on his rent. That was good. Newt Gingrich gave him a $500,000 gift certificate to Tiffany's. And then of course they bring in the cake and the candles and he makes a wish and he blows out the candles. He opens his eyes and oh, darn, he's still President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Ways Barack Obama Celebrated His Birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Updated his resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Treated himself to a piece of First Lady's carob-flavored kelp loaf birthday cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Asked for an iPad, let Republicans negotiate him down to a wad of gum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pizza and video games at Washington kids' restaurant 'Chuck E. Schumer's.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Asked for any cash gifts to be in Canadian dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Sent 82nd Airborne on In n' Out Burger run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Invited fun costume characters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Shark Week' and two pints of Chubby Hubby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Got a fabulous make-over from Michele Bachmann's husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Forged a Kenyan birth certificate to get him out of this miserable job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a very tough week for President Obama. A new poll shows that President Obama is losing support among voters in Florida. Losing support there. Yeah. Which explains why this morning the President announced that he sent SEAL Team Six out to get Casey Anthony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the upcoming 2012 election, political analysts are now saying that Oprah Winfrey can help deliver President Obama the white working class female vote. Yeah. Analysts also say Dr. Phil can help deliver the crucial fake doctor vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has joined Rick Santorum in signing the marriage pledge, which opposing gay marriage. Then while signing, something magical happened between the two of them. Now they're spending the weekend together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Michelle Obama urged her husband's supporters to sign an e-card for his 50th birthday, which explains why Joe Biden has magic marker all over his computer screen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Fox News will host the next Republican primary debate on August 11th, in Iowa. Yeah, Fox News will ask some tough questions like, 'How much better are you than Obama?', 'Why is Obama such a bad President?' And, 'Man, can you believe we elected that guy?' It's gonna be very interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big weekend movie opening is 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes.' Pretty amazing story. Not only do the apes take over, they actually do a better job with the debt crisis than Congress. Fascinating story.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama turned 50 years old yesterday. Caused a lot of confusion in Washington. In fact, when Michele Bachmann heard that Obama was turning the big five-0, she said, 'We're in a financial crisis and he's going to Hawaii? That is ridiculous.' I don't think they quite understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, instead of blowing out the candles on his cake, President Obama gave a big speech about the economy and it sucked all the air out of the room. Yeah, so the candles went out on their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And later this month, President Obama will embark on a bus tour through the Midwest that will focus on jobs. Mainly, him trying to keep his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was on this day in 1861 the Federal income tax went into effect. So what happened was back in those days there were a lot of armed robbers and thieves. So the government rounded them all up thus forming the IRS as we know it today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got some bad news for the Chinese. That money we were gonna pay you back with, turns out we had it in the stock market. Yeah, tough break. Hey, though, some good news. After one of the worst weeks in 30 years, the market slightly recovered today, up 60 points. Sixty points? In fact, economists say if we can do that every day for the next 200 years, we'll be back to where we were last week. So that's fantastic. That's fantastic news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that Joe Biden will make a diplomatic visit to China in two weeks. You could tell he's taking it seriously. He spent all day trying to read fortune cookies without adding 'in bed' after each fortune. 'The long path is often the hardest -- in bed.' Damn!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new study found that Presidents age two times faster than normal people while they're in office. Or, as John McCain put it, 'Whew, good thing I lost.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It's been a tough time for the economy but this week, President Obama declared that, 'Things will get better.' And then he opened his eyes and blew out the candles on his birthday cake. It was just a really nice moment. It was a really beautiful moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has downgraded the US from AAA to AA+ and it gets worse. Today England, Italy, and Greece defriended us on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Standard &amp; Poor's has warned there's a one in three chance we could be downgraded again in the next three years. We could go from AA+ to F-U.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced he is not going to resign. He has suggested he might be leaving and getting a job in the private sector, but thanks to his economic policies, there are no jobs in the private sector. So I guess he's going to stay. You know, I don't know why Geithner would even quit being Treasury Secretary. It's got to be an easy job, especially now, since there's no money in the Treasury. I mean, you don't even have to lock the door. Yeah, leave it open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, only a couple days until the big Iowa Republican straw poll. Pollsters say it's a dead heat between the guy you never heard of, the guy who used to be somebody, and the woman who has no chance of winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody leaked Texas governor Rick Perry's college report card to the press. Not good. He got mostly C's and D's, even got an F. They said Governor Perry got a D in principles of economics. If he can't be President at least he can work for Obama's economic team. So that's good to know if the other thing doesn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the big story, the stock market dropped 600 points because Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded our rating from AAA to AA. On the bright side, Pat Sajak is willing to sell us another 'A' for $2 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, America's credit rating took a real hit this weekend. On Friday night, the US actually lost its AAA status. Or as Joe Biden put it, 'What happens if I get a flat tire?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Michele Bachmann is on the cover of the latest issue of 'Newsweek.' Did you see the picture? Take a look. I mean, that's when you know it's bad, when even you look surprised you're running for President, you know? She looks like she just walked in on Newt Gingrich taking a shower. That's not fair. That's not fair at all. What'd she do to 'Newsweek'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;About 45,000 Verizon employees are on strike after failing to reach a new contract. Yeah. Things are so bad, S&amp;P downgraded them from Verizon to AT&amp;T.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States on Friday, the credit has been downsized. The United States is in a credit fall. We have gone from AAA to OMFG!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you what losing an AAA credit right means. It means our credit is somewhere between France and the Los Angeles Dodgers. If the United States had wheels, we would drive somewhere nobody could find us. Like behind Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I know a lot of you are probably nervous because on Friday Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded America's credit rating. It has always been AAA. But it is now plummeted to the unthinkableably humiliating AA +. And we have to get our parents to sign it and we have to turn it back in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And who is S&amp;P to downgrade us? These are the same geniuses who overestimated our deficit by $2 trillion. Plus they didn't even list America's most valuable asset, Jesus. It says right on our money, 'In God We Trust.' If the Lord can turn water into wine, surely he can turn our debt into wine. Which is good because we're going to need a drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Dow skyrocketed up today. It was up 400 points, that's good. Well see, that shows you.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I saw Captain Crunch drinking Captain Morgan. That's how bad it was today. The economy is so bad the Chinese are now demanding to be paid back in pesos. That's how bad the economy is. I'll tell you how bad the economy is. The Kardashians have now been downgraded to the Judds. That's how bad. Even rich people are hurting. Today I saw a baby in Beverly Hills, only had one nanny. The economy is so bad, Jesse Eisenberg was forced to do a movie about MySpace. The economy is so bad, you know the Chef Gordon Ramsey? You know what he was cooking today? Meth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this controversy with 'Newsweek' magazine and Michele Bachmann? She's on the cover of 'Newsweek' and here people have complained.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After yesterday's 600-point drop, the stock market fell, and then got back up again six times today. Isn't that amazing? Basically, the stock market is acting like me after three appletinis. Actually, two appletinis. Just the smell of an appletini. A cough drop. I am gone. That Vick's vapor rub just put me over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next Presidential campaign seems to be well under way. New reports say President Obama's re-election team is going to try to portray Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney as weird. That's right. They will also try portraying Michele Bachmann as Michele Bachmann. 'Newsweek' magazine is taking heat for calling her the 'Queen of Rage.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a small fire today at President Obama's vacation home in Martha's Vineyard. Yeah, or as Obama told China, 'Darn, that was where I was keeping the $14 trillion I was about to give back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, Rush Limbaugh accused President Obama of trying to inflict as much damage as possible in four years. And then, Rush Limbaugh's chair accused him of doing the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas is going down. Did you see this? They say it could soon be under $3 a gallon. You know what that means, huh? You now can afford to drive by the house you used to live in. You can go by the job you used to have. And you can go see the bank where you used to have money in there. It's the trifecta of the recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama said this week that the downgrading of our credit rating should give America a renewed sense of urgency. A renewed -- when was this not urgent, okay? The only people who don't think it's urgent are the Congressmen that just went on a five-week vacation. Huh? Can we get their ass back here? Can you come back and fix this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I tell you, think President Obama has been trying to pass the buck a little bit here? Like he said again today, he inherited a lot of the problems with the economy. Then he said Presidents Hoover and Ulysses S. Grant didn't help either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the lowest number in two decades of Gallup polling, only 24% of Americans want to see members of Congress serve another two-year term. The other 76% want to see them serve a 20-year to life term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I didn't know. You know China has the exact same credit rating that we do? You'd think their credit would be better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2012 Presidential election well underway. People are already fighting. The other day Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum accused Texas governor Rick Perry on being soft on gay marriage. In response Perry said, 'So you would rather I be hard on gay marriage?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the crazy stock market in flux, the price of gold has shot up to almost $2,000. In other words, Flava-Flav's mouth is now a millionaire and about to retire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, this is interesting, Republican Presidential candidate John Huntsman announced that he has secured the endorsement of Jeb Bush, Jr., the son of the brother of former President Bush. Yeah, analysts say that Huntsman has all about sewn up the guys you didn't even know existed vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some election news. During a speech this week, Michele Bachmann said she won't use teleprompters if she is elected President. And then she added in, 'And that is a promise from me to -- hang on. Hang on, I got it here somewhere. Gosh. Oh, here it is. Good afternoon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Republican party is making automated robo-calls to voters, blaming Democrats for the credit downgrade. Yeah. I thought I got a robo-call from Mitt Romney. Turns out it was actually Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you remember the 2010 mid-term elections when America was rocked by a tea-soaked populist uprising, just some regular Joe Earl Grays and Jane Orange Zingers in Middle America taking back their country from the out-of-touch elites. ... I'm sorry. This is your country? I'm sorry. There's a terrible misunderstanding. We were told it was a timeshare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow fell again, and no one was home to help it up. For those of you having trouble understanding this bad financial news lately, let me put it in terms you might understand. The economy is planking right now. Try not to think of this as a crash. Think of it as a special Wall Street edition of 'Wipeout.' Okay? On Monday, the Dow dropped like, 655 points. Yesterday, it gained 430 back. Today, it dropped another 520 points. The ninth biggest point drop in history. Which is bad, I think. Stock market losses are losses on paper. It's nothing a little whiteout can't fix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Financial analysts are worried we may be headed for a double-dip recession. Sounds kind of delicious to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw this in the paper today. It was this week in 1776 that news finally reached London that America had declared its independence on July 4th. See, it had to go by boat, and it took two months for the news to get there. We went from being a colony owned by the British to a free and sovereign nation now owned by the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said again today that he inherited most of the problems with the economy. How many think he's being modest? I think he deserves a little credit. Come on. The guy's being modest now. Come on. You got to take a little bit, little bit there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congress is now appointing a debt committee to deal with the debt. You know, I thought Congress was the debt committee, okay? Aren't they the ones that put us in debt. Hello.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to NBC news, Texas governor Rick Perry is running for President. I don't know, you think he has a shot? Huh? A governor from Texas with a cowboy mentality who didn't do very well in school? Would we ever elect somebody like that? I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the 'Newsweek' cover of Michele Bachmann? Reporters say they deliberately used a photo that made her eyes look crazy. Here's the actual photo. That's the one, yeah. But God bless them. You have to give them credit. You give them lemons, they make lemonade. In fact, her husband Marcus now uses that picture in their clinic to scare lesbians straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Mexican government, the number of people leaving Mexico for the United States is now practically zero. Nobody's coming across. And you know something? I think it's true. You know, the other day I was in downtown Los Angeles, and I heard something down there I hadn't heard in years. English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough, tough week for Barack Obama. They're saying it's the toughest week of his presidency so far. And some analysts think that President Obama has been making many of the same mistakes that President Bush made. In response Obama said 'That's ridiculous. Now if you'll excuse me, Spongebob is on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he's not officially in the race 15% of Republicans and Independents are leaning towards supporting Rick Perry. Yeah, half of Perry's supporters like his conservative values. The other half think he's the lead singer from Journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Newsweek' magazine has stirred up controversy this week with their cover photo of Michele Bachmann. People are saying the photo makes Bachmann appear crazy. There's the photo. I don't know why people think it makes her look crazy ... Well, yesterday, 'Newsweek' was trying to defend itself. 'Newsweek' published some outtakes from the photo shoot. They published some of the other photos because they wanted to demonstrate that Michele Bachmann always looks kind of intense and crazy in her photos. The first one is her praying. This one is her intensely greeting a voter. Here she is putting on lipstick. Here she is handing out campaign literature. And finally, this is her eating road kill, which we found particularly yeah, I didn't like it. I was against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. President Obama took campaign volunteers out for burgers yesterday and apparently he left a 35% tip. Man, that guy is so generous with China's money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin with a sentence only uttered once every four years. Our top story tonight is in Ames, Iowa. The site of the Iowa straw poll which is the subject of Indecision 2012, Corn Polled Edition. The Iowa straw poll is, of course, the early August, not very predictive precursor to January's wildly non-predictive Iowa Caucus. The idea is Presidential candidates set up tents. In those tents the candidate offers to pay an individual $30 straw poll entrance fee. In return, the individual promises to cast their vote for said candidate, all while both parties pretend this corrupt transaction in no way affects either party's inherent heartland folksiness. It's just good old fashioned, down home country vote buying. All the fun of a poll tax with none of the consequences. So clearly the key to winning with the Iowa straw poll is not some of having the best platform and message but the most kick-ass tent. And dare I say no one can pitch a tent like Michele Bachmann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Mike Huckabee performing at Tim Pawlenty's straw poll concert] &quot;Look, music from Huckabee is fine but it's not a great sign for you when your musical entertainment could probably do better than you in the straw poll in Iowa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Rick Santorum will be there. His tent boasts Rick Santorum's summer dance party which, by the way, is the lowest testing BET pilot ever. 'Hi, everybody, who here likes to cha-cha? Remember leave room for Jesus.' Of course, if summer dance parties are not your thing, perhaps you would like some of Rick Santorum's homemade peach jelly. They're handing out samples of their peach jelly. Wow. Rick Santorum must really be trying to change the search results that come up when people Google Santorum and jelly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: [On Huckabee also performing at Rick Santorum's and Herman Cain's tents in Iowa] &quot;Mike Huckabee, I never thought I would have to say this to you. You are a slut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, this is a very big week for Republican Presidential candidates. Tonight there is the debate in Iowa that will feature all the major players and Tim Pawlenty. Then Saturday of course is the straw poll in Ames, a crucial test to see if a candidate can get Midwesterners to put down a food plate long enough to mark a ballot. But the big news today came from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines where in an attempt to appeal to more voters, Ron Paul had himself batter dipped and deep fat fried.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this, according to TMZ, President Obama, is a pretty good tipper. They said the other day, he took some friends to lunch and left a 35% tip. See, apparently he knew the waiter, turns out it was his old former top economic adviser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you something, you know, I turned on 'America's Got Talent' last night, and I said to myself, 'Boy, these -- contestants really sucked.' Then I realized I was watching that Republican presidential debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Newt Gingrich made a surprise announcement he's still in the race, I had no idea. Anyway, last night during the debate, Michele Bachmann was asked if she was a submissive wife, but she said 'No, but my husband is.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Texas Republican governor Rick Perry announced he's running for President, he's gonna announce it officially this weekend. Yeah, well he's only two points behind Mitt Romney in the latest poll.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough, tough times for Tim Pawlenty. Yesterday Pawlenty announced he is dropping out of the race for President. He said he wanted to spend more time with his family because even they don't know who he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Rick Perry has entered the race. It is being reported in his early days in the Texas state legislature, Rick Perry used to wear his jeans so tight that his nickname, and I'm not making this up, was Crotch. I don't know about you but number 77 on my bucket list is the President of the United States named Crotch. Wouldn't that be amazing? Ladies and gentlemen, President Crotch. Then we'd get respect in the globe, because the Chinese wouldn't say 'Crotch, we need that money.' They wouldn't. Yes, they would.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Phil Hinkle who voted to ban gay marriage was caught propositioning a male prostitute. He said, 'Well, I wasn't going to marry him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our big story tonight is presidential politics. New candidates in, old candidates out.. ... Yes, once again Ames, Iowa, in the spotlight as the results of the 2011 Iowa Straw Poll are in. ... Bachmann wins. The ayes or shall I say the crazy eyes have it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huntsman got 69 votes. If all of Jon Huntsman's supporters met at the same Ames, Iowa, Quiznos the fire marshal would say, 'That's fine. No problem. There's still some tables open in the back.' Huntsman was the only Mormon running in the straw poll, and he came in second amongst Mormons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This pretending Ron Paul doesn't exist for some reason has been going on for weeks. ... How did libertarian Ron Paul become the 13th floor in a hotel? He is Tea Party patient zero. All that small government grass roots businesses ? he planted that grass. These other folks are just Moral Majorities in a tri-cornered hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Saturday was the Ames Straw Poll. Everyone was there except the ones who weren't. And Michele Bachmann won it all. Her tent was by far the most popular. Now some analysts say it is because of her strong support among evangelicals. ... Now another factor might have been that Bachmann helped her supporters pay for the $30 voting tickets by paying for them. ... That's right, she paid $180,000 to hand out 6,000 tickets but it was worth it because she got 4,823 votes. Bachmann got a commanding 80% of the votes she paid for. That's pretty impressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;In Iowa this weekend there was some presidential campaign action. The Iowa Straw Poll was held on Saturday. This is an event that gets a lot of attention. Even though it's basically a bunch of people eating corn dogs and saying who they're maybe going to vote for next year. It's more a test of the candidates' pancake flipping ability than of their popularity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann won. She won the straw poll. She won the straw poll and the crazy straw poll. Both of them. Apparently it costs $30 to vote in the straw poll in Iowa. The campaign paid the fee for 6,000 people and she won but she won with less than 5,000 votes. Which means about 1,000 voters stole her $30. It was kind of funny that a person who's running, her idea is she doesn't believe in government handouts, handed out $30 apiece to 6,000 people. That's how it goes I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Let's be honest though. Michele Bachmann is not going to win. She has no chance at all. She's making herself a celebrity. Did you see her on the cover of 'Newsweek'? The only thing she's going to win is a staring contest. I mean, look at those eyes. Look at those crazy eyes. That's her 'Vote for me or I'll eat your children's face. Get closer, if you can. I don't think I'd be comfortable with a President who can see through my brain. She's terrifying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently, Texas governor Rick Perry distanced himself from George W. Bush by saying, 'I went to Texas A&amp;M, he went to Yale.' That's what he said, in other words, Rick Perry's idea of instilling confidence is to say, 'Don't worry, I'm not as smart as George W. Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, former President Bill Clinton said that Rick Perry 'is a good looking rascal.' This is part of a speech Clinton gave entitled 'I'm Looking for a New Wing Man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidates are already making mistakes. While on the campaign trail, Mitt Romney, who I thought was programmed not to make mistakes; Mitt Romney accidentally said he was in Iowa while he was giving a speech in New Hampshire. Yeah. Afterwards, Romney apologized and said, 'I momentarily mixed up my sea of white people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who else made a mistake? Michele Bachmann made a mistake. Today, Michele Bachmann wished Elvis Presley a happy birthday even though today is the anniversary of his death. That's true. When told about the mistake, Bachmann said, 'My apologies not only to Elvis, but the entire Costello family.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House sent Vice President Joe Biden to China today. So now we owe them a trillion dollars and an apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama's summer vacation is definitely over. He's driving around the Midwest right now in a bus because nothing inspires hope in the American economy like a President riding a bus. Presidents should travel in something cooler. President should be on a jet ski with machine gun in the front or something, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Obama's hoping the tour will boost his approval rating. Republican front-runner Mitt Romney is mocking it. He's calling it the 'Magical Misery Tour,' which is kind of funny coming from a member of the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hair Club for Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;These Tea Party guys do not like Obama. Seems like everything he does upsets them. In fact, our scientists here at the show, we have a research and development team. They have come up with a machine, it's called the Tea Party machine. What it does is, it gives you a sense of how the Tea Party thinks. For instance, I have a newspaper story here about Obama's bus tour. The headline says 'Obama Continues Midwestern bus Tour.' All right. I'm going to take this over here and I'm going to feed it into the Tea Party machine. It's currently being reconfigured using technology that mimics the actual thought process of Tea Party members. The machine runs on patriotism...and here we go. Okay, so that translates to 'Kenyan Bus Runs over Jesus.' So, you can understand why they're upset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wake of her Saturday all- or not at all-important less than 200 vote victory over Congressman Ron Paul in the Ames, Iowa, straw poll, Michele Bachmann's star shone brightly with the appearances on the five Sunday talk shows. 'This Week,' 'Face the Nation,' 'Meet the Press,' 'Fox News Sunday' 'State of the Union.' she went on ESPN 'Sunday Night Baseball,' 'Real Housewives of New Jersey' and into the night by attempting to bust Phineas and Ferb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Perry, &quot;it's day two and you're already cowboy boot-deep in hay hitting on America. It's long campaign, man; you're going to have to dial back the Texas a notch. You're already at Yosemite Sam level. You've got to dial it back to 'Walker, Texas Ranger' territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seriously? Obama's back in campaign mode already? ... Right. No, it's not a campaign trip. I'm sure the President just had some frequent Greyhound miles he had to burn by the end of August or he loses them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama on a big bus tour the last couple of days in the Midwest and he's talking about jobs. He's talking about making jobs in America.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michele Bachmann is in the news. She said that when she's President, gas prices will come down to less than $2 a gallon. When asked how she'll make that happen, Bachmann said she'll hunt down the CEO of Exxon and stare at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Obama today wrapped up his three-day bus tour. ... Obama has been making stops in a number of different cities to conduct town hall meetings.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There's a new front-runner in the Republican primary race, Texas Governor Rick Perry. A new national survey has Perry ahead of Mitt Romney by 11 points and then Michele Bachmann is five points behind him in third place. I think it's going to come down to whichever candidate wears the most flag pins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our coverage of the elephant stampede to the White House continues. As you may recall, Sunday belonged to the fiery Congresswoman from Minnesota Michele Bachmann, whose performance at the Ames straw poll vaulted her to the front of the race. ... But that was Sunday. After careful reflection, it was decided Monday and Tuesday belonged to Texas governor Rick Perry, whose stunning entrance to the presidential race vaulted him to the front of the race. ... In fact, Perry reminds me a bit of a former Republican contender Michele Bachmann, who brought so much excitement and buzz to the GOP landscape lo, those many hours ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Nation, Texas Governor Rick Perry has been in the race only three days and he's already blowing away the competition like it's a trespassing coyote. ... Any candidate can say the Environmental Protection Agency is killing jobs. But only Perry goes the extra step, and says it while killing the environment with his idling bus. ... And he's right. EPA regulations are killing jobs. I recently had to fire my asbestos taster. It's a shame. He really needs the health insurance. So tonight, I toast Governor Perry's call to end regulation with this champagne flute of lead paint. Mmm. Semi gloss? The more I drink, the more sense a President Rick Perry makes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The guy can't win. But his staff is pointing out after 31 months in office; Obama has taken only 61 days off. At this point in their Presidencies, Ronald Reagan had taken 112 days off; George W. Bush had taken 180 days off. Bill Clinton took the least, only 28 days off. But in retrospect, I think we have a pretty good idea of why he liked to spend time&quot; in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During yesterday's east coast earthquake, &quot;Down at City Hall Mayor Bloomberg felt the earthquake and he ran looking for cover and they found Mayor Bloomberg during the earthquake standing under his desk.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They traced the epicenter of the earthquake to Governor Chris Christie's aerobics class.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, Donald Trump, you could see the ripples going through his hair. Just undulation. On the bright side, I didn't have to shake my morning martini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel bad for President Obama, his popularity is sliding. He's up in Martha's Vineyard. He's getting to be so bad he may be the first President voted off the island.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Show of hands. How many folks are here for the show, how many folks are here for the jihad? You'll come for the show; you'll stay for the jihad. That's right. I had a guy last week put a fatwa out on me and going to cut out my tongue. Anybody ever had a fatwa? Wow, buddy. I've got to say, CBS has been fantastic. When they heard about the fatwa, the first thing they did, they started holding auditions for my replacement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Had a lot of support here after the fatwa. The Stage Deli named a sandwich after me. It's the Dave Letterman and it's sliced tongue on rye.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this thing going on in Tripoli, in Libya, huh? Pretty exciting, right? ... Apparently Colonel Gadhafi is in hiding and they don't know where he is. They think he's with his two sons Hoss and Little Joe but they can't find him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big question about Libya is once they topple Gadhafi, can Libya put together a functioning stable government? And if they can do that, for the love of God, will they show us how to do it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney announced earlier today that he is building a $12 million beach house in California. $12 million beach house in California.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You see, someone sent me an envelope with white powder. It turns out it was just corn starch, which is kind of a mixed blessing. On one hand, I have an enemy out there somewhere. On the other, my soups will be thicker and richer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Obama is on vacation he gets his daily briefing. ... it's not really a vacation. It's not like , 'No, I'm not taking calls, I'm on vacation. No, no, don't bother me, I'll be on vacation. Call me after Labor Day, I'm vacationing.' It's not like that at all. He gets daily briefings. They're talking to him about like Syria, hot spots around the world, Syria, Libya. He wants to know all about Kim Kardashian's honeymoon, I mean its 24/7.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Dick Cheney has a book coming out. He said that when people in Washington read it, 'Heads will be exploding.' People are really nervous. Because when Dick Cheney says heads will be exploding, heads will be exploding.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Did you watch what's going on in Libya? ... They are looking for Moammar Gadhafi. He is still at large. The rebels who ransacked his compound made an interesting discovery today. I'm not making this up. Gadhafi had an obsession with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He even had a scrapbook full of her pictures. This is true! A lot of people were surprised. I'm not. I'm attracted to powerful women. Condoleezza Rice, Madeline Albright, Ryan Seacrest. All of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
