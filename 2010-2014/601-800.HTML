<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House is now urging Americans not to read too much into last week's job report. They said it would be best if you don't read it at all. Don't even look at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In June, President Obama's re-election campaign raised $71 million. And Mitt Romney's campaign raised $107 million. Isn't it amazing how much these candidates have to collect from special interests to get across their message that they can't be bought?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney addressed the NAACP this week. I understand he worked very hard on his speech, but the problem is Mitt Romney does not know a lot of people of color, so he first ran the speech past John Boehner. Yeah, I guess that was as close as they could get. Romney told the crowd that if he were elected President, he would fight for all millionaires, black or white. How about that? Actually they say Romney's speech swayed a number of African-Americans from supporting President Obama to strongly supporting President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a Democratic fund-raiser in Seattle earlier this week, Vice President Biden said that Romney's economic policies were George Bush on steroids. That's as opposed to Obama's policies which are on Ambien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biden always does this. In a speech in Las Vegas to Latino leaders, he talked about when he was growing up; his parents didn't have much money and how thin the walls were in his house. That's all he had to say -- the walls were very thin. And he said he didn't know how his parents did it without being heard. Now I'm guessing the sound of Joe constantly talking drowned them out. I think that might have been what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Mexico, the loser of their presidential election is now accusing the winner of election fraud. He says the winner bought millions of votes. To which Mitt Romney said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this very day in 1804, Vice President Aaron Burr mortally wounded former Secretary Alexander Hamilton during a pistol duel. Shot him with a gun. Here's an interesting piece of history. The gun used in that duel was supplied by the great, great grandfather of Attorney General Eric Holder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today while speaking at a NAACP convention, Mitt Romney said that he would repeal Obama's healthcare law, and was actually booed. Got even more awkward when Romney was like, 'Hell yeah, I'm your boo! And you're my boo, and you're my boo, too. We're all boos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army says it's developing a new body armor for female soldiers, inspired by 'Xena: Warrior Princess.' In related news, everyone at Comic Con just joined the army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney turned up in an unlikely place today. He gave a speech at the NAACP conference in Houston. Why, I don't know. Maybe he confused NAACP with NASCAR, but it got off to a bad start when Romney pulled up in front of the convention center and locked the doors to his limo. Romney isn't very popular among African-American voters. In fact, diabetes is more popular among African-American voters than Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this heat wave! What was it -- 100 degrees out there? The inside of my car was so hot, I was steering with my knees even when I wasn't texting. That's how hot it was. It was so hot, even straight guys were going to the movie theaters to watch 'Magic Mike.' That's how hot it was. I was sweating like Mitt Romney trying to differentiate between Romneycare and Obamacare. That's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former FBI Director Louis Freeh released his report about the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State. Man, it's pretty damning. The report said top school officials lied. Top officials lied. They covered up; they ignored the problem just to protect themselves. In fact, you know where a lot of these guys could end up? Serving a two-year term in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Indiana man has pled guilty to strapping four kids to the hood of his car and then driving them around. So, it looks like Mitt Romney may have found his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden made a sex joke during a speech yesterday. And he referred to the house he grew up in. And you know, they didn't have much money. And he said, Joe Biden said, 'The walls were very thin, and I wondered how my parents ever did it.' You get the feeling, every time Joe Biden speaks, President Obama wishes Biden's parents never really did do it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney announced he is going to the Olympics in London next month. No word if he's going to be rooting for Switzerland, Bermuda, Luxembourg, or the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Mayor Bloomberg who is the mayor of New York City and he does a lot of interesting things, a lot of innovative and dynamic things, he is now saying we should build tiny, tiny apartments. Tiny little apartments, 250 square foot apartments. Tiny, tiny apartments. And they would be less expensive than the typical New York tiny, tiny apartments. These would be tiny, tiny, tiny apartments; 250 square feet. Mitt Romney has wallets bigger than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wall Street says that they prefer Mitt Romney. Wall Street prefers-- and by God, who could question Wall Street's judgment, am I right? Ladies and gentlemen. Is it rock solid?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the other day Mitty goes by, swings by and he has an appointment with the NAACP and they booed him for a minute and a half. Booed him for a minute and a half. Or as I call it, Wednesday. That's another Wednesday. Mitt Romney cares about the minorities, you know, like the 1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting, this is a way to gauge how things are going. A new survey indicates that Obama supporters love iPhones. So if you have an iPhone chances are you are going to be supporting President Obama. In a related story, if you support Governor Chris Christie from New Jersey, chances are you love IHOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, House Republicans held their 33rd vote to repeal Obama's healthcare law. It was mostly a symbolic vote that accomplished nothing -- or as Congress calls that, a vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US Olympic Committee coming under fire now after it was revealed that the uniforms for Team USA that they're going to wear in the opening ceremonies were made in China. The Olympic uniforms were made in China. It turns out they were made by some of the same kids who could wind up beating us in gymnastics. That's the worst.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Friday the 13th. And to prove he's not superstitious, Mitt Romney drove around with a black cat on the roof of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying that Condoleezza Rice is on the top of the vice presidential list for Mitt Romney. Well, many Republicans think they'd complement each other. I mean, Romney has experience in American jobs. Condi has experience with foreign countries. And since all American jobs are now in foreign countries, they'd be the perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the city of San Bernardino has become the third California city to declare bankruptcy. There was a meeting yesterday of city officials, mayor, police chief, fire chief and the city council. Here's how broke they are. That's all the same person, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, California is so broke San Francisco now has a cover charge and a two-drink minimum to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. That's how bad it is. California's so broke; Mexico fixed the hole in the fence to keep us from crawling back in again. That's how bad it is. California is so broke; I saw a going out of business sign on a meth lab. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, everybody today is Friday the 13th. Considered to be the unluckiest day of the year. Yeah. Most people are avoiding black cats while Mitt Romney is still avoiding black audiences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some more political news.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night I went out for Chinese. Picked up a Team USA Olympic uniform. Yeah, it was great. You follow this whole Olympic uniform scandal? This is unbelievable. People are very upset we have American athletes in uniforms made by the Chinese and they're wearing French berets. I don't know if we're supposed to compete, ask for a loan or surrender. I don't know what we're supposed to do. I am very confused. Well critics are now saying these Chinese uniforms are un-American. Have you looked around America lately? Cheap crap made in China. That's what we're wearing. Does it get any more American than that? No. That's what we do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an angry John McCain lashed out at the White House today saying President Obama's first term was the worst thing he's ever observed. And hey, this is the guy that picked Sarah Palin. Okay. So he knows. He knows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well President Obama said today his campaign is still about hope, which makes sense. Because everything people hoped for four years ago, they're still hoping for right now. We've gone from hope and change to no change, just keep hoping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, getting nasty out there on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney said he would refuse to release more than two years of tax returns. He's only releasing two years of tax returns. And the Obama campaign is keeping up the pressure. Today they released over 10 years of birth certificates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is going to Israel this Sunday. When asked if he will go to the West Bank, he said, 'No, I keep my money in the Cayman Islands.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, Mr. Haircut, he comes out and there's some controversy with Bain Capital, his old company, and the fact that he won't release his tax returns because he doesn't want us to know, I don't know, what doesn't he wants us to know, that he earned money? That he had a job, that he paid taxes? Or maybe something more sinister? So he is now saying -- he wanted to clear things up -- so he clarified it. He says that he in 1999, he retired retroactively. I said 'Wow, this son-of-a-bitch is a time traveler.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some election news here, you guys. President Obama's campaign has just released a new ad that actually features Beyonce. Which explains why his approval rating just went up 80% among all the single ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Well, he now says the uniforms they make for the 2014 Winter Olympics will be made right here in the USA using our own good old fashioned illegal immigrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Harry Reid and other members of Congress, they're just furious over this Olympic uniform deal. He says we should burn the uniforms, and it's an embarrassment and a disgrace. Not as embarrassing as Congress constantly borrowing money from the Chinese, but still embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beautiful actress, Kate Beckinsale on the show tonight. She's got a terrific new movie called 'Total Recall.' Same title as the original, but different, but same kind of theme. It's about a company that provides people with implanted fake memories so they're not sure what's real and what's not. Kind of like Mitt Romney's years at Bain Capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the Democrats are calling on Mitt Romney to release all his tax returns. And today Wesley Snipes said, 'Don't do it, Mitt! It's a trap. It's a trap. Don't do it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama told CBS News the biggest mistake of his first term was not being a good enough story teller. See, I got to disagree. I think he told some great stories. Remember the one about cutting the deficit in half? That was a great story. Closing Guantanamo Bay? I loved that one! That was fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a group of gay Republicans calling themselves 'GOProud' have come forward and endorsed Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney was so touched by this gesture of goodwill from the gay community; he vowed to move his money from the Cayman Islands to Fire Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'Newsweek' Sarah Palin has not yet received an invitation to the upcoming Republican convention. It's just a month away, she hasn't been invited yet. They say she's feeling a little snubbed. I don't think she should feel bad. I mean, a lot of the Republicans aren't that excited about Mitt Romney going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the Olympic uniforms? It's for the American Olympic team and it's berets. First of all, how many of you checked your beret before you came in here tonight? To me, nothing says America like a guy in a beret. Look at our founding fathers, they all wore berets. So the berets, that's kind of a thing. Then also we find out that the uniforms are made in China for God's sakes. Take a look at the uniforms. Look at them. There they are right there. That looks like a crew on Mitt Romney's yacht for God's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this yesterday at a basketball game. President and Michelle Obama were caught off guard by the Kiss Cam. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney was caught off guard by the Show Us Your Tax Returns Cam. Granted, that one is not as much fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fun fact. Since becoming Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has spent over 300 days out of the country. That's a record. President Obama called her travel record 'inspiring' and Bill Clinton called it 20 years too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you guys see this? During last night's USA-Brazil basketball game, President Obama gave Michelle a kiss when they were shown on the Kiss Cam. That's cute. It explains why everyone was, like, 'Quick, put him on the Fix the Economy Cam!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, yesterday in Cincinnati, Jerry Springer announced that he is endorsing Obama. Don't get too excited. Obama still has to win over Judge Judy and Maury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know, President Obama had a funny thing happen to him last night. He and the first lady got booed at a basketball game. They were at an exhibition game between Brazil and the USA. You know the Kiss Cams where the camera stops on a couple on the audience and forces them to kiss? The camera stopped on the Obamas last night and they froze. Not kissing on camera is a strategy they learned from the Clintons when they were the White House. After that, I don't know if someone got in the President's ear -- which, by the way, you can fit a fully grown person in his ear. The Obamas got another shot at the Kiss Cam later in the game. This time, spit was suitably swapped. Go to the Lincoln Bedroom, you two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Meanwhile, Mitt Romney is still refusing to release his tax returns. So far, he's released returns from 2011 and 2010 but said, he's, quote, 'Simply not enthusiastic about releasing any of the other years.' You know what, if he's not enthusiastic about it, then he shouldn't do it. My grandmother always said, you got to have enthusiasm. Romney actually did release his returns to the McCain campaign back when he was considered to be a running mate for John McCain back in 2008. McCain took one look at him and said, 'You know what I'm going with the crazy moose lady instead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Cincinnati, President Obama had a meeting with Jerry Springer. He is trying to win the vote of husbands who cheat on their wives with men. That's a big demographic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is close to announcing his running mate. It could be a woman. Apparently Romney wants a female with a strong stage presence and the free time to campaign. So I'm guessing Steven Tyler.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Olympic controversy continues over these Chinese-made uniforms. Well, now Ralph Lauren, the designer who made the US Summer Olympic opening ceremony uniforms -- he now says the Winter Olympic uniforms will be made in America. Okay, Central America, but it's still -- It's still kind of America-y.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama went to see the US Olympic basketball team play Brazil the other day. And during the game, they were put on the Kiss Cam. You probably heard about this. At first, they didn't kiss and the crowd booed them. Then the camera went back to them. And they finally did kiss. Isn't that amazing? A politician in Washington caught on camera kissing a woman he's actually married to? That has never happened.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Romney's surrogate, John Sununu -- he's in hot water for saying that, 'I wish President Obama would learn how to be an American.' Well, that's kind of insulting, isn't it? Don't you think? President Obama spends money he doesn't have. He loves to skip work and play golf. He sneaks away from his wife to eat fatty foods. What is more American than that? Okay, there is nothing more American than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Obama Administration has reportedly told Syrian rebels they can't help them until after the election. So at least they're consistent. That's the same thing they're telling us. 'Can't help you until after the election. I'm sorry. Can't do anything for you now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This presidential campaign, it's starting to get ugly. Mitt Romney is calling President Obama a 'failed President.' President Obama is calling Romney a successful businessman. So, it is ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in his new campaign ad, President Obama asks, 'What is Mitt Romney hiding?' My guess -- a personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and during a fundraiser at a country club in Mississippi, Mitt Romney said 'The GOP is a party focused on helping the poor.' See? His wife, Ann, is right. He is funny. He can make jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? For the first time ever, the average Canadian is now richer than the average American. No, no, no. No, that's good. Somebody else we can borrow money from. That's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential politics, that's the very definition of the word ugly and Mitt Romney is now portraying President Obama as foreign. Foreign. This coming from a guy whose money lives on the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Mitt Romney is choosing as his vice presidential running mate a Senator from Ohio Rob Portman. Here's a picture of Senator Rob Portman. There he is right there. ... The Senator looks like one of those guys who's interviewed after a UFO sighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Questions On The Application To Become Mitt Romney's Running Mate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. 'Bank Account: Swiss or Cayman Islands?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Why would Mitt hire you instead of cheaper, foreign labor?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Ever shot a hunting buddy in the face?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Mind if Mitt's dog rides in your car?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Are you willing to strongly support both sides of every issue?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'What traffic sign best describes the way you make whoopee?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Do you promise not to vote for Obama?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'What's the name of your dancing horse?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Have you ever Anthony'd your Weiner?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Can Mitt borrow your tax returns?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to start off the show tonight with good news for President Obama. ... According to a brand-new poll that just came out, 70% of Latinos said they plan to vote for President Obama, 70%. The other 30% would, but Mitt Romney won't give them the day off work to vote. Let's just say he has a big lawn, ok. That's a lot of azaleas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this year's Republican convention Chris Christie has agreed to give the keynote address. When reached for comment, he said, 'Keynote? I thought they said key lime.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark Hamill who played Luke Skywalker in 'Star Wars' is warning voters that Mitt Romney is not human. Over, on the other side of the aisle, Yoda has been saying 'Obama in America born wasn't.' It's controversial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been a lot of reports out there about a new drug called bath salts. ... People who smoke the drug behave unpredictably. They have been known to rip off all of their clothes and run around screaming. They have been known to attack people like zombies. This is scary and getting attention in the media. How about the people that have positive experiences on bath salts? How come we never hear about them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with ESPN, President Obama said that 1992's 'Dream Team' was better than this year's Olympic basketball team. Which is interesting, since a lot of people think 1992's President was also better than this year's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this, guys. It turns out that when Mitt Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake City Olympics, some of the uniforms were made in Burma. That is ridiculous. You don't make American uniforms in Burma. You make them in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today American Airlines honored an 86-year-old mechanic who has been with the company for 70 years. Passengers were like, 'Aw, that's so sweet. But he didn't fix this plane, did he?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know that yesterday, the great Rush Limbaugh said that the new 'Batman' movie is part of a liberal conspiracy. I'm like what are you talking about? Rush, I'm trying to work with you here. But Batman is a billionaire who doesn't trust the system to get the job done. He has a butler and an awesome car that gets like two miles to the gallon. He is the most Republican superhero of all time! Batman is a Republican. Well, that is until we find out that Bruce Wayne was actually born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, jobless claims rose again by 35,000 last week. Not good. But it does show that if you're unsuccessful in this country, you didn't do it on your own. You had help. Thank you, President Obama. Thank you. You're not alone. You didn't do it alone. That's right.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four of Mitt Romney's five sons say that, in the beginning, they were against their father running for President. They were against it but then they changed their minds, proving flip-flopping is hereditary. It's handed down, father to son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest forecast, hot and dry this week with 100% chance of Michele Bachmann making an idiot of herself. You know about this? Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and house are furious at Congresswoman Michele Bachmann's new claim that Islamists have infiltrated the highest levels of the Federal government. She even went so far as to accuse one of Hillary Clinton's assistants, who is of Palestinian heritage but is an American citizen. God bless John McCain. He spoke out. John McCain denounced her as being completely out of line. Let me tell you something -- when the guy who picked Sarah Palin says you are crazy, you are crazy. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Capital One has a new slogan. 'What's in your wallet? Nothing, we took it all!' Well, Capital One will have to pay $210 million to settle charges that they deceived customers into spending more money. In other words, they pleaded guilty to being a bank. That's basically what they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ever watch the American idol show? You know what I'm talking about? Well, some big changes coming up. According to 'The New York Times' Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez fired, gone. So that means Obama has two vacancies to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Mitt Romney's rule and this makes perfect sense in picking the vice presidential candidate, is quite simple. And I admire him for this. His rule for picking position number two on the presidential ticket, do not harm the ticket. Do not harm the ticket. And Republicans have been very good at this. If you look historically, Eisenhower had Dick Nixon. Dick Nixon had Spiro Agnew, George Herbert Walker Bush it Dan Quayle, John McCain had Sarah Palin so they've been really good at not harming its ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, here's some election news. A new poll -- CBS poll found that 47% of voters are supporting Mitt Romney, while 46% support Obama. Well, it makes sense, 'cause if Romney wins, it's definitely going to be thanks to the one percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of Romney, a man in Maine who looks like Mitt Romney is hoping to start a career as a Mitt Romney impersonator. And if that doesn't work, he's going to stick to his current job, a mannequin at Kohl's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The apartment President Obama used to live in when he was a college student is now up for rent. It's $2,400 a month. Which is a bargain when you consider how much money Mitt Romney is spending trying to move into where Obama is living now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

A strip club in Tampa, Florida is now preparing for the Republican convention by hiring a stripper who looks like Sarah Palin. A Sarah Palin lookalike. Yeah. That's for the guys. For the Republican women, they got a Chippendale dancer who looks like John McCain. Not quite as hot. No, apparently this Sarah Palin lookalike comes onstage dressed as a nurse.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's search for a Vice President continues. As you know, one of Mitt's problems is he's never hired an American for a job before, so this is new.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush said he will not -- will not -- be attending this year's Republican convention. I think that's a good idea. The country still hasn't recovered from the convention Bush attended in 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A strip club in Tampa is luring Republicans with a Sarah Palin look alike. The woman is identical to Sarah Palin in every way except the stripper has a tangible skill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get this Mitt Romney will travel to London where he will attend the Olympics' opening ceremony.

I got one there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Romney, I read that his campaign has raised $10 million in California over the last two days. Yep. $1 million was from a fundraiser. While $9 million was from Romney checking a pocket in some old khakis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, obviously, everybody is still stunned after the terrible shootings Friday. Are we ever going to get a handle on how to prevent these types of tragedies? It's a very complex issue, obviously. An intersection of the mental health system, cultural influences, the balance between individual freedoms and public safety. The availability of guns. I mean, it's a factor along with other factors. Obviously it's a complex ecosystem. Owning a gun is a right protected under the Constitution and that's -- You know, I agree with that. I mean, I don't have to agree with that, its right there. But we can't have tanks. If we draw lines on weaponry, obviously, the question is have we drawn them right? ... I'm just saying that if these terrible not un-gun related stories create like sinus pressure in your head and you would like to get yourself some Sudafed to ease that sinus pain, that's really hard to do to get Sudafed. To get that good Sudafed you need ID. And there's a background check and then you've got to sign that [bleep]. Sudafed, I think we can all agree is some dangerous [bleep].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you're telling me it's too soon to even have a conversation about it? You're telling me that to discuss the epidemic of gun violence in this country, for that there is a waiting period? Yeah, I guess you'd hate to go into a conversation about guns all hot-headed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To prepare for the Republican convention, a strip club in Tampa, Florida has hired a Sarah Palin lookalike to perform. Finally, somebody the Republicans can get excited about. No, this stripper is so much like Sarah Palin, she actually has written on her hand 'Take off top, shake breasts, swing around pole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the Obama campaign spent more money in June than it took in. Any businessman will tell you, you can't run a campaign like that. Apparently you can run a government like that but not a campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney is going overseas for a week. I guess he's gonna visit his money. That'll be nice. Stop in Switzerland. See some dollar bills in Luxembourg. Go to the Cayman Islands. 'How you guys doing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney gave a speech to the VFW today. I guess Obama did this the other day. I never understood why VFW specifies veterans of foreign wars. I mean, aren't all wars foreign wars? I mean, are they deliberately trying to keep Civil War veterans out of this organization?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's in London? Mitt Romney. They said 'Mitt, get your campaign plane, get your family, you don't know anything about foreign policy. Strap your dog to the roof of the plane, go to Europe.' He landed in England, got off the plane and proudly declared 'Ich bin ein Londoner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you think of London, you think of Rolls Royce. Now there's a nice car. ... They have Rolls Royces, they have class distinctions. They have royalty. They have butlers. Hell, Mitt ain't coming back. When he arrived at the hotel he was greeted by his money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some experts say President Obama's campaign may come down to the Jewish voters in Florida. That's what they're saying. His whole campaign may come down to the Jewish voters in Florida which explained why he announced his new running mate is Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, speaking of President Obama, he gave a speech in Oakland, hundreds of people showed up to voice their support for medical marijuana. And by 'showed up' I mean wandered in four hours late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for eroding America's standing in the world. Yeah. Romney said, 'I want to make America the kind of country I could one day deposit my money in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the White House announced that President Obama will visit Israel during his second term in office. Of course when they heard the second term part, Israel was like, 'We'll put you down as a maybe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, last night hundreds of people gathered outside of Obama's fundraiser to protest his crackdown on medical marijuana. Yeah, they were like, 'What do we want?' 'Legal weed!' 'When do we want it?' 'Whenever.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that the price of oil fell by more than 3% yesterday. When asked how much this will lower the price of gas, oil companies were like, 'Ha ha, good one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk that Mitt Romney's campaign is paying for Twitter followers. Yeah, he's paying for people to like him, or as that's also called, politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney is involved in a Twitter controversy right now. Normally his Twitter audience increases by between 3,000 and 4,000 followers a day. Somehow over the weekend he got 135,000 new followers which is a lot for someone who still has the egg as their profile picture. Some people believe the Romney campaign bought a bunch of followers. You can do that, you can buy followers. The Romney people deny it. Others are suggesting most of his followers aren't even human. They have what they call Twitter-bots, I guess computer programs, most what they tweet is repetitive nonsense. This is what one of Romney's new followers tweeted, 'LMAO, lucky there was no time left on the clock.' And here is the exact same thing from another follower. And from another follower. With the new followers, Romney's followers is around 819,000 very low compared to Obama's 17 million Twitter followers. Maybe he should think about signing up Justin Bieber.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during a campaign stop in Florida this week, President Obama said that Mitt Romney's medical plan will hurt senior citizens. Mitt Romney, he fired right back. He accused the President of trying to scare Madonna.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and Mitt Romney is now in London. He's in London today to see his horse compete in the dressage event. Dressage is kind of like horse ballet basically. Yeah. Finally, something that connects Romney with the average American voter, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney said while he is in Europe, he won't be apologizing to anybody. He has nothing to apologize for. A lot of those people overseas now have good jobs because of him. They are very, very grateful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a big story in Los Angeles. People were shocked when we woke up and heard this today. The LA City Council has voted to ban medical marijuana sales at all 750 dispensaries. Yeah. They are going to shut down all the medical marijuana shops in Los Angeles. You know what this means to the owners? Chronic unemployment. That would be chronic -- Let me tell you something, this ban is going to affect millions of people, dozens of which have legitimate medical problems. You know the reason they are closing these marijuana shops? It's a zoning issue. I guess space needs to be cleared for the meth labs. Apparently meth labs, they bring in more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You go into restaurants in New York City they will sell you a bottle for $2.50, a bottle of New York city tap water. New York City tap water is cloudier than Mitt Romney's finances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney, now they said, 'Mitt, if you're going to be serious about being President, you know nothing about foreign affairs, diplomacy, we have to get you to Europe and running around like a busybody and get you to impress people and bone up on foreign policy.' And while he's in these foreign countries, he plans to visit his money, so that will be good. Going to say hello. He's going to be there for the opening ceremonies. He's going to be in London for the opening ceremony of the Olympics. In fact, he plans to take his tax returns, drop them into the torch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strange facts coming out about both presidential candidates. A new study suggests President Obama's emails are more personal than Mitt Romney's emails. Yeah, Romney's usually end with 'Best Regards, Mitt,' while the President's usually end with, 'I killed Osama bin Laden.' That's actually on his stationary now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech this week President Obama said that thanks to him people in the rest of the world have a new attitude toward America. That's true. People used to hate us. But thanks to him now they just feel sorry for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that 90% of voters think they know where the candidates stand on the important issues. When Romney heard that he was like, 'Great, now tell me where I stand on the important issues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt is embarking on a worldwide tour of three countries. He packed his bags, got his shots, and strapped his dog to the roof of his jet. Now, Mitt's first stop is London to salvage America's special connection with the English people. As a Romney aide told London's 'The Telegraph,' 'The White House didn't fully appreciate the shared history we have because we are part of an Anglo-Saxon heritage, and Romney feels that the special relationship is special.' Well said. I would go further and argue that the special relationship is also a relationship. ... But I don't think this goes far enough. I mean, we must acknowledge not only our common Anglo-Saxon heritage but what about our shared Battle of Hastings heritage when our shared French-Norman heritage conquered our shared Anglo-Saxon heritage by shooting an arrow through our shared King Harold's eye?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man. Mitt Romney's in hot water from implying that the British weren't as prepared as they should be for the games. Well, now he's backpedaling on those comments. He now says the Olympics will be terrific.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney caused quite the controversy at the Olympics. You follow this, right? Mitt Romney campaign still trying to do damage control after remarks that Romney made while in the UK. Probably Romney's worst gaffe was when he visited Buckingham Palace and said to Queen Elizabeth, 'You call this a house?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney is in Israel now. Over the weekend, Mitt Romney was in Jerusalem and he slipped a prayer into a crack in the Wailing Wall, yeah. And while he was at it, he also stuffed in $3 million of taxable income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks there is one thing I have never understood about the Olympics. For some reason they open the games with the halftime show. I think it's metric. I don't know. Well, after the chilling onslaught of the Beijing opening ceremony. London had a tough act to follow. ... One part of the show really twisted my tea bags. A song and dance number celebrating the NHS, Britain's socialist National Health Service. Look at that. That kid's not even sick. He's faking it to get free healthcare. Get ready for Obamacare, folks. Instead of taking you to a hospital, they throw you on a rolling disco bed and cram you a thousand at a time into a stadium while spectators jeer when your colonoscopy gets thrown up on the kiss cam. It's coming. Don't kid yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The games are on and America is doing great. Right now the United States and China are tied in total medals. Naturally the US trails in gold because every time we win one, we hand it over on the podium to pay off our national debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Olympic officials have determined it's too cold for the women's beach volleyball competitors to wear bikinis. In a related story today, Bill Clinton came out in favor of global warming.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney back on US soil. ... Some conservatives are saying Mitt Romney's trip overseas was a disaster and he should have stayed home. In response, Romney said, 'But some of my favorite homes are overseas.' And then he ate gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, today Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wraps up his historic vacation to England, Israel and Poland, and I'm sure he's glad to finally be coming back homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course the liberal media has been hammering Mitt throughout the trip for a couple of hiccups, like when he offended Palestinians by suggesting they aren't prosperous because of their culture and offended the English when he questioned whether London was ready for the Olympics. Why is that controversial? Every week Hank Williams, Jr., questioned if Americans were ready for some football. Come on. Double standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So all in all a successful trip. Best of all, Romney has checked three countries of the list of 1,000 places to offend people before you die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt isn't the only Romney wowing them on the international stage this week.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been a ton of depressing development in campaign finance in recent years. Citizens United, the rise of the super-PAC. I don't think the image associated with campaign finance is quite as sad as this one. It's the President of the United States sitting alone with his laptop in a room where perhaps Teddy Roosevelt sat when designating the first national park or Lincoln sat emancipating the slaves or Taft sat eating an incredibly large bowl of chili. ... What was our President doing alone with his laptop? Donating to his own presidential campaign. Mr. President, don't do it. Don't hit the donate button. Don't give you your email address. You'll end up spamming the living [bleep] out of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you know there are so many dangers facing this nation but sometimes a hero rises. Well, tonight we salute Senator and Galapagos-American Mitch McConnell. Yesterday on the floor of Senate McConnell once again attempted to repeal Obamacare. Now why was it so important for him to stop it yesterday? Well, it's because today is the day that Rush Limbaugh tried to warn us about. ... That's right. Free government birth control for all the ladies. So don't forget to reset your watches and check your calendars because it's now whore o'clock on the first day of Skankuary. Today every woman in America reported to their local Planned Parenthood to be hooked up to the Yaz force feeding tube like a sex crazed foie gras goose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless Congress comes up with a deficit reduction deal on January 1 there will be a trillion dollars in automatic spending cuts and the Bush tax cuts expire which the Congressional Budget Office says together could cause another recession. Our only hope is that Democrats and Republicans in congress work together to find a compromise on tax cuts. In other words, we're all going to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did they say the Democrats passed a Democratic plan? That can't be right. Wait a second is this some kind of dream? Let me check my totem. Hold on one second. It's real evidently. Evidently it's real. The problem is, House Republicans are not going to vote for this tax cut. Because it excludes the top 2% and virtually every Republican in Congress has signed a pledge to never raise taxes, a pledge extracted by the president of Americans for Tax Reform and fourth most popular Grover, Grover Norquist. And everyone knows he is not a guy you want cross. ... He's like the Terminator combined with a phoenix combined with a guy that just read 'Atlas Shrugged.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

That's unheard of in that I've never heard a dressage score. Is that good? Is that good? I'm being told -- I am being told that no one knows. Anyway the second round is tonight.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Administration is being accused of allowing damaging security leaks to burnish their own reputation, and this is a problem. Let's show how an example of these injurious leaks could be used in a damaging way. Let's use an example from, I don't know, September 8, 2002. Let's say somebody in the Bush Administration wants the public to believe that Saddam Hussein is actively reconstituting his nuclear weapons of mass destruction program. We'll call that guy Vice President Dick Cheney. The Administration would leak that information about the nuclear reconstitution to a high-ranking 'New York Times' reporter. Let's call that person, mmm, Judy Miller. Judy Miller would then report that information in the 'New York Times.' At which point the Vice President Cheney would go on 'Meet the Press.' ... The story that Cheney is citing about this reconstituted program is the one his Administration planted through Judy Miller in the 'New York Times.' And now to bring the whole thing full circle she's on the TV as the expert on why other people doing it is not good when in reality the move she's describing should be called 'pulling a Miller.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a longtime viewer of this show you know I warned you about the dangers of secret Muslims lurking all around us. I'm on to you al-Abama. That why I admire Minnesota congresswoman and amateur hypnotist Michele Bachmann for her brave attempt to root out Muslim extremists from our government.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past June, she and along with fellow Republicans Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Tom Rooney and Lynne Westmoreland, a group often referred to as the Mensa of Congress, sent a letter to the executive branch alleging that recent executive governmental decision 'appear to be a result of influence operations conducted by individuals associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.' In other words: Muslims have infiltrating our government. Exhibit A: Did you know that the Congressional cafeteria serves crescent rolls? That is nothing more than warm buttery jihad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, these accusations caused a firestorm because one of the suspected infiltrators is Huma Abedin, wife of former underwear model Anthony Wiener, top aide to Hillary Clinton and an admitted Muslim. Now, these charges were made without evidence and were denounced by Republicans John Boehner, Lindsey Graham and John McCain who took to the floor of Senate and called her accusations 'specious and degrading.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But yesterday former speaker and current not-going-to-be-president Newt Gingrich defending Bachmann on the CNN.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;To start raising the issues of McCarthyism.&quot; Newt Gingrich: &quot;First of all behind McCarthyism, there were real spies.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;There were a lot of innocent people who suffered.&quot; Gingrich: &quot;But there were a lot of guilty people who would have never been uncovered if people didn't have the courage to take them on.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes, it takes a brave man to randomly accuse someone of something horrible based on no evidence and demand they refute the evidence you don't have. So tonight I'm accusing Newt Gingrich of being a baby eating werewolf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's be serious. Let's hear what the President says.&quot; Barack Obama, President of the United States: &quot;He'd asked the middle class to pay more taxes to give another $250,000 tax cut to the people making more than $3 million a year. It's like Robin Hood in reverse. It's Romney Hood.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Should be easy for Romney to top Romney Hood.&quot; Mitt Romney,: &quot;We've heard the President say things about me and my policies and the if I were to coin a term it would be Obama-loney.&quot; Stewart: &quot;How can a guy that looks so much like Don Draper be so bad at writing ad copy? Everybody loves about baloney. At least try for a meat no one likes Obama-loaf. That's something. That's an insult. And maybe they hit you back with pastram-ney.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great Olympics. In fact, Team USA finished the games with 17 more medals than China. China said it was tough to swallow. Especially when they had to make all of our 'We're number one' t-shirts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some big election news. Mitt Romney is hoping to energize Republicans by announcing Paul Ryan as his running mate. Seriously? That's like trying to spice up a bowl of oatmeal with more oatmeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the announcement, Mitt Romney said that he and Paul Ryan are America's comeback team. You know, as in 'come back in four years and try again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Romney unveiled his vice presidential choice at a rally on Saturday morning on the deck of the battleship USS Wisconsin, a ship on which both men served. I'm sorry a ship where they were served refreshments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there has been a lot of concern in my circle of friends that the Republicans have been letting this election get away from them. But worry no more. Because Saturday morning Mitt Romney made the most important announcement of his political career. ... Paul Ryan for President! Whooo! Whooo! Oh, whooo! What a relief. Because for nine months now I thought I was going to have to vote for Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh yes, the young ones love him [Ryan]. After all, he's the chairman of the House Budget Committee. Or as the kids call it, 'the budge.' I mean this dude wants to cut government entizzlements. And of course, like all Republican VP picks, he looks exactly like Tina Fey! I cannot wait cannot wait to see SNL this fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the kids are down with Ryan's 'budge' and how dope it is that it eliminates the capital gains tax which means that under the Romney-Ryan plan, Romney would pay a tax rate of 0.82%. Ryan gives out all these tax cuts without ballooning the deficit. We just have to cut all nonmilitary spending by 91% over the next 40 years. And we will need that defense spending to protect ourselves from the gangs of marauding seniors pillaging for Lipitor. Now Ryan's budget replaces Medicare with a voucher program and I believe Social Security becomes a lottery which will save the government tons of money because if your monthly check has a black dot, we stone you to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>

But after checking his wallet, he only had enough money to buy ten people beers. You realize what progress this is? You realize what this means?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Mitt Romney has picked Paul Ryan as his running mate. Well, experts say Ryan can add something vital to this campaign that Mitt Romney lacks -- a personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, you know, it was pretty cool because nobody suspected him. Mitt Romney kept the selection of Ryan as his VP nominee for more than a week. You know how he's able to keep a secret? He had it hidden next to his tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA landed a spacecraft. Were you aware of this? It took them three years to get the spacecraft called Curiosity on Mars. Are you aware of that?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Paul Ryan, a new poll actually found that 42% of Americans do not approve of Mitt Romney's running mate. Which isn't too bad considering most Americans don't approve of Paul Ryan's running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this story? Yesterday, Mitt Romney attended an event hosted by a man who was convicted of smuggling cocaine.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, the heat has not let up here; 109 today in Los Angeles. See, I was sweating like a Medicare patient in a Romney/Ryan rally. It was so hot today; Joe Biden is putting his foot in his mouth just to cool it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Obama visited a wind farm in Iowa. This is interesting. You know, just one wind farm with 50 turbines generates as much wind power as a single Joe Biden speech. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, 'Mitch' Romney has selected his running mate Paul Ryan as his running mate. He's a fascinating guy. You know what he does? He goes into rivers and with his bare hands will grab live catfish. It's called... What they call it is catfish noodling. And I like to think here in New York City we are open-minded enough to accept things like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they say, though, that this [Paul Ryan] could be a big boost for the Republican ticket and I was thinking well, hell, Joe Biden could be a big boost for the Republican ticket, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and President Obama is getting... Bless the guy's heart. I mean, it's the worst job in the world and you have to run -- you have to beat yourself up before you get in to take over the worst job in the world. I mean, would you be surprised if nobody ran for President? I wouldn't be surprised. Nope, sorry, I got a gig at Dairy Queen. That's where I'll be. I'm not running for nothing. Are you kidding me? I'll be noodling some catfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, Biden has made too many mistakes for Obama and he's fed up and so today, this is true, a friend of mine called and he said it happened, President Obama -- this is unprecedented. President Obama called Mitt Romney and asked Mitt if he would fire Biden. True story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans like Paul Ryan because they say he's a fiscal conservative and that's a perfect balance for Romney who's a guy that has an elevator for his Cadillacs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House just revealed that it brews its own beer, and President Obama drinks it when he goes out campaigning. And even more of it when Joe Biden goes out campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, his campaign also released a new ad featuring celebrity DJs called 'DJs for Obama.' Yeah, because when voters are trying to decide their position on the fiscal budget, healthcare, war in Afghanistan, their first thought is 'What does DJ Pauly D think?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously tonight, you know, Paul Ryan recently tapped by Mitt Romney to be his running mate, Ryan's been getting an awful lot of media attention. Well, Joe Biden, he's not going to sit back and let that tenderfoot soak up all his ink. ... Okay, that's bad. But in his defense, for a guy who has, in the past, exhorted a man in a wheelchair to stand up for what he believes in, referred to someone's still-living parent as their late beloved parent and once authorized a $6 billion Federal expenditure for a dinosaur egg that turned out to be a bowling ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are the Republicans really that blind? You know, the rhetoric on all sides can be hateful sometimes but are the Republicans really that blind to the depths of their own vitriol? You won't believe how blind. Blinder than a man Joe Biden would publicly challenge to a staring contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;By now, I presume you are aware there is a presidential election coming up. Things are really starting to come together. Last week, Obama called his opponent Romney-Hood. And Romney retaliated by calling Obama, 'Obama-loney.' Then Romney told Obama to take his 'campaign of anger and hate back to Chicago.' Then Obama's campaign called Romney unhinged. Joe Biden told a mostly black audience that Republicans want to put us back in chains. And -- that happened. And then, for good measure, Obama brought up the Romney putting the dog on top of the car thing again. So, we are finally starting to tackle the big issues. It's kind of incredible; they are going to spend close to $2 billion insulting each other. Like the world's most expensive Comedy Central roast played out over a year. ... Eighty-three more days, folks. And then we start over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney, today, said he wants to cut funding for things like Amtrak and PBS. Both of which are subsidized by the government. I don't know much about Amtrak, but I don't like the idea of cutting funds for PBS. Things are bad enough already. One of the Muppets is living in a garbage can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Here's some bad news for Congress. A new Gallup poll shows that only 1 in 10 Americans approve of the job they're doing. A 10% approval rating is -- that's -- that's about the same approval rating that rabies has. It's not good. Ten percent ties for the lowest approval rating ever for Congress in the 38 years Gallup has been measuring it. Who is this tenth person that's still approves of the job they're doing? That's a very tolerant guy. That's the guy I want to live next door to, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in the Oval Office. They agreed on a new economic plan after losing last night's big powerball lottery. That didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, President Obama on the campaign trail. He's still reminding people that he inherited this economy. And let me tell you something, if this economy doesn't turn around soon, his inheritance could be cut off in November.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden has a new slogan ? 'Chains You Can Believe In.' Well, even though he made a number of gaffes this week, President Obama says he's sticking with Joe Biden as his running mate, and Biden is thrilled. Of course he's thrilled. Do you want to be looking for a job in this economy? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think so. And Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are now campaigning separately. They didn't want to, but Chick-fil-A threatened to pull their campaign contributions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mitt Romney said he will not release any more tax returns. He said today he guarantees he paid at least 13% every year. 13%? That's not a tax, that's a tip, okay? In fact, it's even a crappy tip, isn't it, 13%?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with 'The New York Post' this week, Sarah Palin said she would never do 'Dancing with the Stars' because she is a horrible dancer. And you know Sarah Palin; she would never enter a competition she was totally unqualified for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you have Paul Ryan fever? Come on. We all do. He looks like a guy who owns his own chain of nursing homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paul Ryan likes to catch a catfish bare-handed. Anybody ever done that? Actually, he'll wade into a river and catch, with his bare hands, take just a giant -- and pull it out with his bare hands. Chris Christie likes to reach into the tank at Red Lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Senator John McCain said it would be wise for President Obama to drop Joe Biden from the ticket. Wait, John McCain is giving advice about choosing a running mate? That's like Donald Trump giving advice about choosing a barber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The band Silversun Pickups is asking Mitt Romney to stop using their song 'Panic Switch' while campaigning. Or as Romney put it, 'Well, I guess it's back to 'Call Me, Maybe!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview with 'Fortune' magazine, Mitt Romney says he wants to cut funding for PBS. When he heard that, Oscar the Grouch was like, 'Seriously? I already live in a garbage can. How much worse can my life get? You've got to be kidding. That's right; Mitt Romney wants to cut funding for PBS. Which explains why today, 'Sesame Street' was brought to you by the letters 'O' and 'Bama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know and you well know this, in person voter fraud is an enormous issue with more than exactly 10 documented cases of it in the entire country alone. Just since the beginning of the millennium. That's .000000284% of all votes! So you can see why Pennsylvania would want to enact a voter ID law that one city claims would potentially disenfranchise more than 758,000 of that state's lawfully registered voters, or around 9% of the entire Pennsylvania electorate. But that's the price you pay to prevent something that doesn't happen. It's like how peanut put certificate made with huge amounts of hydrochloric acid to-- dragon bones that May have gotten into it during the manufacturing process. Will you lose some people who die by eating hydrochloric acid? Of course. But isn't it worth knowing that your peanut butter is dragon bone free?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday Mitt Romney announced Paul Ryan as his vice presidential pick. And every news organization in the country has been clamoring to learn more about the 'dynamish' duo but only one publication had a reporter out there on the bus on day one. 'People' magazine, or as Mitt Romney calls it, 'Corporations' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A reporter from 'People' joined Romney and Ryan on the campaign bus the day after the announcement and filed one of the most penetrating fluff pieces in this week's issue. It's titled 'Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan: The Honeymooners.' ... Now these men quickly bonded over their mutual interests as Ann Romney explained they're able to 'communicate on this very intellectual policy wonk level.' Well no surprise. These two really like policy. Mitt even added, 'I like policy.' And when asked what books he reads Ryan said 'I read policy.' Clearly they're perfect for each other. Right now they're sharing their deepest, inner most policies with one another. And if we elect them, they may even share them with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Ryan proved himself a man of many dimensions when he revealed his second one. Quote, 'I listen to lectures from the Great Courses in the car. I'm listening to a great one on Voltaire right now. I enjoy studying the Enlightenment which is an 18th century debate.' Yes, the Enlightenment was a fascinating debate back in the 18th century about whether science and reason had a role to play in the public sphere. A debate that to Republicans rages on to this day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney released his tax return from 2010 and he released an estimate of what he paid in 2011. But that's it. This morning in South Carolina, he told reporters, 'I went back and I looked at my taxes and over the past ten years I never paid less than 13%.' What? 13%? There are kids with lemonade stands paying more than 13%. If you tip 13% in a restaurant, they'd probably spit in your food the next time; 13% is not something Mitt Romney should be bragging about. It's something Mitt Romney's accountant should be bragging about, certainly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that people should measure prosperity in terms of happiness and life satisfaction instead of dollars. Hey, what is this guy? Our life coach now all of a sudden? Hey, you're head of the Federal Reserve, you take care of the dollars; we'll measure the happiness, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney is predicting that as President, he will create 12 million jobs in his first term. Well, President Obama says a Romney presidency would result in lost jobs. Yeah, his and Biden's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, Paul Ryan accused President Obama of failing to stop China's economic cheating. China's economic cheating? We can't even stop China's badminton cheating, okay? Please, please, let's start with that. And then work your way back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this is my favorite political story of the week. There was a point on the 'Politico' website that the choice of Paul Ryan has not helped Mitt Romney with Hispanic votes. So let's see, the whitest guy in the country picks the whitest guy in Congress from the whitest state in the union, Wisconsin, and that's not helping Hispanics? I am stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants lined up in cities all across the country this week to receive work permits under President Obama's amnesty program. Well, except in Arizona where Governor Brewer refused, telling the state's agencies not to grant driver's licenses to any illegal alien. Of course, many illegals that showed up are very disappointed. What could they do? They got back in their cars and drove back to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama said today he's working on a plan to release oil before November to lower the gas prices. It will be released from our strategic election reserves -- I mean oil reserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Porn star Jenna Jameson has endorsed Mitt Romney. Although, Jameson did say as a porn star, she does admire Joe Biden's ability to put his entire foot in his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said today he is sticking with Joe Biden. Which means one of two things -- either he thinks Biden is doing a good job or Hillary said no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, president Obama said that he is sticking with Joe Biden as his running mate even though Biden made a series of major gaffes this week. In response, Joe Biden was, like, 'This is [bleep] great!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more election news. Yesterday, Mitt Romney brought a dry erase board to a speech so that he could explain his plan for Medicare. It's pretty simple, actually. All he did was write the word 'Medicare,' and then he erased it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally I want to wish a happy birthday to Bill Clinton, who will turn 66 years old this weekend. Yeah, Bill and Hillary did their best to rearrange their schedules, but it turns out they'll have to spend it together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who has hit the ground running. That Paul Ryan. What do you think? I mean I'm telling you this guy; he looks like somebody who would be holding seminars on condo flipping. I will tell you something, I saw the guy today at an event introducing Mitt Romney in New Hampshire. This guy is fit. He's in shape and he's ready to go and he gets up every day and goes through some sort of military workout and is in the top condition of his life. You know why Paul Ryan is in the top condition of his life? Because he knows to take care of his family and his country he needs to be in the top condition of his life. Now across the river we have Governor Chris Christie, but that's another story. ... Paul Ryan is a dedicated Congressman, sleeps at his office. And I thought is that what got Clinton in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big thing now is that people are all worked up about. I'm excited about this. Because I love this more than life itself. What we have here is a guy going into the greatest race of his life for the highest office in the world, the man that could control the United States and bring us out of our economic malaise but he has a secret. He won't release his tax returns. Now between you and me, do you care? But it's just like, hey when are you going to -- what are you? Can you? And the Republicans, of course, are indignant about it but this is exactly what they did to Barack Obama with his birth certificate, 'Yeah, well, I'm going to wait until I see his birth certificate.' How many folks right now can lay your hands on their birth certificate? It's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are getting ready for the convention; they're busy down there in Florida auditioning minorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is worth half a billion dollars and is saying now he pays annually 13% in tax. Al Capone paid more than 13% in taxes, ladies and gentlemen. Al Capone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Congressman Kevin Yoder Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. What's the big deal, I was naked the whole trip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It was Spring Break, chill out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. People in the Middle East are pretty easy-going about nudity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In my defense, I had been drinking heavily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Trying to take the focus off Mitt Romney's taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It had been days since a Congressman did something embarrassing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's Obama's fault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Putting the 'junk' back into 'Congressional junket'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, six days after Paul Ryan was picked to be Mitt Romney running mate, a shirtless photograph of him finally turned up on TMZ. That's why we're the best workforce in the world. Here's the photo, Paul Ryan with his wife Janna taken six years ago while on vacation in Oklahoma which raises an interesting question, who goes on vacation in Oklahoma?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's actually pretty common to see shirtless photos of our political candidates. I'm sure you remember this photo of President Obama not wearing a shirt in Hawaii. Of course, there's the Republican candidate...Mike Huckabee. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney is refusing to release more than the first four inches of his torso, though he insists he has nothing to hide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news, you guys. A new survey predicts that women and the elderly are more likely to vote in the presidential election. Which explains the new front runner, Michael Buble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New research shows that Angelina Jolie and Hillary Clinton are actually ninth cousins twice removed. Or as one guy put it -- [ in the voice of Bill Clinton ] 'I think it's time for a family reunion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC now stands for Nothing But Cutbacks. Man, we've had terrible budget -- so, let me give you an idea how bad the budget cuts have been. Tonight's monologue was written entirely by illegals. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, gas prices hit an all-time high for the month of August. Expected to go even higher. You know, you can tell gas prices are going up. Prius drivers starting to get that smug look on their faces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney says if he is elected, he will create 12 million new jobs in his first year in office. And that's just for people to do his taxes, okay? You got to keep that 13%, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, fellow Republicans are calling for Todd Akin to step down, but Democrats are going, 'Stay in! Don't be a quitter! Hang in there!' Well, anyway, Akin announced a few hours ago that he is staying in the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of House Republicans were scolded for their behavior during a fact finding trip to Israel last year, where they went skinny-dipping in the Sea of Galilee. The guy from Kansas went skinny dipping. In the Sea of Galilee. Isn't that, like, a holy place, huh? Imagine if they had gone to Sodom and Gomorrah. Oh, my God. What would have happened there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in South Dakota, a 92-year-old woman is on the ballot as the Democratic candidate for the state senate race. Her slogan, 'Four More Days.' She's 92, and she's running on social security, literally. I mean, that's what she's running on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we'll all remember where we were when we got the news that Regis had been pushed out of a job. So now, this happened three or four years ago, and ever since then they've been pretending to look for a new guest host for Kelly. They made the announcement today. Guess who it is? Guess who the new guest host is? Missouri Congressman Todd Akin. Way to go, Todd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard now that Mitt Romney has asked Todd Akin to step down. I thought, oh, that's too bad, Todd Akin was the guy to lead the Republican Party into the 16th century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But finding a co-host for Kelly Lee Ripa has been more difficult than finding Mitt Romney's tax returns. ... He looks like a guy who would be the closer at Beverly Hills Mercedes, doesn't he? ... And his running mate, who has dropped out of nowhere and has energized the Republican ticket, Paul Ryan, I mean, come on. And he, Paul Ryan, looks like the guy you see on packages of underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The theme for the Republican convention is 'A Better Future.' Yep. How did they come up with 'A Better Future?' That was the theme from my prom, for God's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, today is National Senior Citizens Day. So that's why the clubs were so packed tonight. I was wondering.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read that a hurricane could be threatening next week's National Republican Convention in Tampa. Yeah, it could really hurt Republicans which explains its name, Hurricane Todd Akin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man running for mayor in New Jersey has been arrested for selling marijuana. Yeah, people knew something was up because he promised to lower taxes on the middle class, on the poor, and on bags of Funions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I want to take a moment to wish the senior citizens in our audience a happy senior citizens day. Today was Senior Citizens Day, so don't forget to have your grandparents spayed or neutered. In honor of Senior Citizens Day today, I ate an entire bowl of hard candy and pretended not to know what a laptop was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Senior citizens day was made official by President Reagan in 1988 to recognize the contributions the elderly make for this country. It's a great day to make a holiday, there's nothing more than senior citizens love than to have a special holiday to remind them they are indeed old.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, President Obama met with the White House Press Corps for only the second time this year. Second press conference in the whole year. It was only 20 minutes long. You know, that kind of makes you miss President Bush. He would spend 20 minutes just trying to answer the first question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a campaign stop in Virginia, Joe Biden said he is such a NASCAR fan, he said, 'I'd trade being Vice President in a heartbeat for winning Daytona.' To which President Obama said, 'Deal! Great. Right, let's do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report by the Tax Policy Center, the gap between the rich and the super rich is growing wider. This could split the Republican Party in two. The haves fighting the really haves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to gold medalist sprinter, Usain Bolt. He turned 26 this week. You know the sad thing? His world record time has already been broken.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Mars rover Curiosity has sent back images of some odd things on the surface of Mars, and some people think they could be UFOs. Here's my question. If we're on the surface of Mars, aren't we the UFO?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks following&quot; Missouri Rep. Todd Akin? &quot;He has some interesting views on health. I think he's in a little hot water. Penn State took down his statue today. ... But when what you do when you say something dumb you apologize. This morning he was on the 'Rachel Ray Show.' You ever see that show? He apologized on the 'Rachel Ray Show and then they made veal mea culpa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know Republicans are going to be in Tampa next week for the big national nominating convention and they there's going to be a hurricane.

The Republicans have proven themselves pretty good at handling hurricanes so I wouldn't worry. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now worried the Tropical Storm Isaac could hit Florida during next week's Republican convention. But, Florida is ready for it. Thanks to President Obama's economic policies, many of the businesses down there are already boarded up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you who was really worried about Hurricane Isaac, was Mitt Romney. But, he can relax now. It looks like the hurricane will pass the Cayman Islands. He was so worried, so worked up. Actually, Mitt Romney and Hurricane Isaac have something in common. They can both change directions at any moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;it's now being reported that Joe Biden will go to the Republican convention to try and cause problems for Mitt Romney. And after that, he'll go to the Democratic convention where he'll definitely cause problems for President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the DNC said that John Edwards has not been invited to the Democratic National Convention. They're concerned having him there would cause them to lose the woman vote. But, Edwards promised he could help deliver the other woman vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dee Snider of Twisted Sister -- he has asked the Romney campaign to stop playing his song, 'We're Not Gonna Take It,' anymore at campaign events. It's not just a Republican problem. Now, a group of magicians have come forward and demanded that President Obama stop using smoke and mirrors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, there's a hurricane bearing down on central Florida. Tampa, could be hit by this Hurricane Isaac, and they might have to cancel or postpone the Republican National Convention. A hurricane headed directly for the Republicans. More proof that God is a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Paul Ryan who hopes to become the Vice President? He's running with Mitt Romney. And the guy's in tremendous shape. He get up every day and runs 20 miles, and then he goes to the gym, the old steel plant, the old steel mill. Yeah, and he pumps iron for, like, two hours, and then he has, like, a protein shake for lunch, and then he swims, and then he goes to work. He's in tremendous shape. This guy can lift, like, 350 pounds of just dead weight, boom, like that. Vice President Paul Ryan. Now the last Vice President who could carry that kind of dead weight. That was Dick Cheney, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN plans to air a 90 minute documentary on Mitt Romney before the Republican National Convention. Yeah, 90 minutes of Mitt Romney. Even Red Bull is like, 'This is out of my league, bro. I can't help you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the campaign, I read that President Obama's supporters can now text the word 'Give' to donate up to $50 to his campaign. Though it's frustrating when autocorrect keeps changing it to, 'Fix the Economy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New research found that people who wake up early are more productive than people who sleep in. Or as Congress put it, 'Is it noon already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tropical Storm Isaac is expected to develop into a hurricane in the next few days. Unfortunately, the Republican National Convention starts in Florida Monday. The National Weather Service says that the storm could reach category 5, which is strong enough to move Mitt Romney's part to the other side of his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Obama campaign made an interesting announcement today. Theirs will be the first political campaign to accept donations via text message.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a hurricane is scheduled to hit Tampa during the Republican convention next week. They say -- actually, these winds are so strong, they think it can actually blow some of Mitt Romney's money back into the United States.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald trump was asked today if he thinks this storm could be an act of God, and he said, 'Look, I'm not responsible for the weather.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Politico,' Donald Trump will have a surprise role on the first day of the Republican convention. He'll be there to tell Missouri Congressman Todd Akin, 'You're fired.' That will be his job. And that's a legitimate firing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest financial reports, President Obama's campaign spent $10 million more than it raised last month. So, at least the guy's consistent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this poll came out today? I love this poll. According to a new poll, Mitt Romney is at 0% among African-Americans. Not one, he's zero percent. And here's the sad part, that's up 5% from last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ah, this campaign is starting to get ugly. Today in Michigan, Mitt Romney said, 'No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.' Birth certificate? We can't even see his tax returns, forget -- let's start with that. Give me that, then we'll work our way up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still no word yet on who the naked women were that were partying with Prince Harry, but I guarantee there were some mighty proud parents out there. See, we don't have a royal family here in America. We don't have that royalty stuff. We elect people then watch them get drunk, waste money, and run around naked. See we do it the more democratic way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an election update. Today, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan attended a campaign rally at an apple orchard in Michigan. Of course, there was one awkward moment when they told the Granny Smiths they were cutting their Medicare. It was just -- they didn't have to do it there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's rumored that Joe Biden is seriously considering running for President in 2016. Yeah, seriously -- which is interesting because voters' reaction to that was, 'Seriously? Seriously? Seriously?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Hurricane Isaac has delayed the Republican convention for one day. It's now gonna start tomorrow. See, I think the Republican used these 60-mile-an-hour winds to their advantage. See, what Mitt Romney should do -- he should walk out there and go, 'Here are my tax returns for the last ten years -- oh, the wind -- oh, my gosh! No! What happened?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is a big storm. In fact, Isaac has scared more senior citizens than Paul Ryan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, some of the Republicans, I think, are overreacting. Like today, Rick Santorum was seen gathering up two of every animal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Herman Cain was in Tampa. Remember Herman Cain? When a reporter asked him, 'Does this remind you of Katrina?' He said, 'I never even met the woman!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting story. It seems the GOP has placed 13,000 umbrellas in bins outside the hall for people to use. The delegates can't bring them inside for security reasons. So after you use the umbrella, you drop it off for the next person to use. That sounds like creepy socialism, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oil company announced today that because Tropical Storm Isaac is in the Gulf of Mexico, gas prices will skyrocket this week. Yeah. This is part of their 'find any excuse to raise gas prices' program. This happens every year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Obama met with the White House Press Corps for only the second time this year. Only the second time he's met with them. He said he would have met with them more but he's been so busy campaigning, he didn't have time to write their questions. So, it's tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? You know the White House is brewing their own beer? President Obama brews his own beer in the White House. Well, in honor of Joe Biden, he put it in a special big mouth bottle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is my -- this is my favorite statistic so far. According to a new poll, Mitt Romney is at 0% among African American voters. He's at zero. And you know, I don't think the GOP slogan for the convention is helping any ? 'See What White Can Do for You.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Republicans were worried the convention was going to be postponed or maybe completely canceled all together because of Hurricane Isaac. This is serious stuff. CNN is on full Blitzer. Full Blitzer! The winds in Tampa are so strong earlier today they blew the dog off the top of Romney's car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year, the theme of the Republican convention is '50 Shades of White.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple weeks ago NASA actually landed -- well it was a car. They put a car on Mars. It's called the Curiosity, the rover. Listen to this. That vehicle, one vehicle, it's now on Mars, two and a half million dollars. Two and a half million dollars. You drive that thing off the lot instantly it's worth less than half that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how long it took the Mars rover Curiosity to get to Mars? Two years. Two years. You know why it took so long? It had to go through Cincinnati.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Convention's being derailed a bit by Hurricane Isaac. That's a little awkward, isn't it? Yeah. Mitt Romney says he hopes that Florida will be spared any major destruction from the hurricane. Yeah. However, to be safe, he's urging everyone to take cover and strap their dogs to something secure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hurricane Isaac has shortened the Republican National Convention by a day. Shortened it by a day. Yeah. The delegates are relieved because that means only three days of having to be fake excited about Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Florida governor Jeb Bush says it's time for President Obama to stop blaming his brother for the economy. Yeah. Then when asked why he himself has not run for President, he said, 'My brother.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to talk about the Mars rover? You bet you do. Tomorrow the Mars rover is going to premier the new -- I'm not making this up -- it's going to premier the new Black-Eyed Peas song by beaming it back to earth. Yeah. In other words, the rover has turned -- ladies and gentlemen, the rover has turned against us. The machines have risen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention started. Oh, and did you hear about this? Donald Trump was bumped from speaking at the Republican Convention because of Hurricane Isaac. See, nobody ever talks about the good things hurricanes do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was revealed today that Mitt Romney and the Republican National Convention organizers paid the rock band, Journey, half a million dollars to perform at a private fund-raiser in Tampa. Hire Journey for half a million dollars? See, who says Republicans aren't helping seniors? Are you surprised that Romney hired Journey? Yeah, I mean, with all his outsourcing experience, I thought he would go with Foreigner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll released last week, Mitt Romney has 0% of the black vote, zero. 0%. In fact, if it wasn't for John Boehner, Romney wouldn't have any support from people of color at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama campaigned at Iowa State University and Colorado State University. President Obama is seeking to make his case with first-time voters. Well, you can understand why. I mean, second-time voters have graduated and can't find a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now; President Obama is brewing his own beer in the White House. Actually, the White House beer is a lot like the Obama Administration -- great buzz, weak finish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FCC is now considering a plan to tax text messages. Hey, you know what that means? We could pay off our $16 trillion debt with what, five teenage girls?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Keeping your eye on Hurricane Isaac and the Republican Convention? Oh, I mean, here's something that could possibly good come out of the tropical depression, hurricane, the storm down in the gulf. It may for once and for all put an end to political conventions. That would be the good thing. Let's right now check the weather conditions at the Republican convention. Do you have the thing? Temperature 72 degrees, humidity 50%, visibility eight miles, white people 98%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda. Have you seen -- I don't know if you have or not. They're running ads now, listen to this. This is the thinking behind Al Qaeda. You tell me we haven't damaged Al Qaeda as a terrorist organism. They're actually running ads now for suicide bombers. I've got a copy, its right there. Look at this. 'Tribeca, earn big dollars, meet virgins.' Ladies and gentlemen, time to update your resume. Who says there are no jobs in this economy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The theme of the convention is 'A Better Future.' Uh-huh. Oh, Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey, will be speaking, keynote speaker, and the theme of his speech similar to 'A Better Future;' his theme will be 'A Butter Future.' Chris Christie will be delivering a 45-minute speech. Usually when Chris Christie talks for 45 minutes it's in clown face at the Jack-in-the-Box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention has begun. You've got to let me finish the sentence. No, it finally started, delayed by the storm but it did start. I give you the latest because we've been paying attention. Ann Romney gave a speech to show America that she and her husband are just regular people like you and I. She made the speech atop her Olympic dancing horse, prancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of protestors have been outside the convention dressed up as vaginas. Yeah, which may explain the last-minute appearance at the Republican convention by Bill Clinton. He just showed up. He apparently -- he's now a registered Republican. And he supports Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of coal miners in Ohio said that their bosses forced them to attend a Mitt Romney campaign event. Yeah. You know you're boring when people would rather dig coal than listen to you speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now official. Mitt Romney is the Republican nominee for President of the United States. Congratulations to him. Actually, Mitt said last night this is the most emotional day in his life. Well, since they lowered the capital gains tax. Remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Ann Romney spoke last night. I thought she was quite eloquent. Analysts say her role was to show that Mitt has a tender side and then the Romney family dog gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Ann Romney gave a great speech. Very heartfelt. Very personal. She said she first met Mitt at a dance 43 years ago and he made her laugh. I'm guessing he made her laugh when he tried to dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Chris Christie, he gave the keynote address. Did you see him? Yeah, everyone made a big deal out of the fact that it took Chris Christie 16 minutes into his speech before he mentioned Mitt Romney. I'm shocked it took nearly three minutes before he mentioned Breyer's Ice Cream. Did you see that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hurricane Isaac turned out to be not much of a threat to the Republican National Convention. But to their credit, the Republicans had a contingency plan. This is pretty good. If the hurricane did hit hard, delegates were instructed to evacuate to Mitt Romney's tax shelter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big gossip now is that there's going to be a mystery speaker tomorrow night. Apparently Republicans have some big mystery speaker lined up. Someone they say will embarrass President Obama. Oh, my God. They got Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate John McCain, he spoke earlier tonight at the convention. A little awkward at first. When they told him he's going to Florida, he said, 'You're not putting me in a home, are you?' Actually, happy birthday to Senator John McCain, 76 years old today. Happy birthday to him. One kind of awkward moment during the birthday celebration when the girl popped out of the cake, McCain tried to nominate her for Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, former Vice President Dick Cheney, he was not invited to the Republican convention. Well, he said he doesn't mind. Besides he says he's just days away from making the Death Star fully operational.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while speaking to college students yesterday, President Obama said, 'I said we'd end the war in Iraq, and we did. I said we'd get bin Laden, and we did. I said we'd fix the economy -- okay. Two out of three is not bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'New York Times,' more than half of President Obama's Twitter followers are fake. They don't even exist. Which is actually a good thing because if they did exist there wouldn't be any jobs for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife the other day at the convention. She calls Mitt 'a decider.' She says her husband is a decider. That's true -- he decided not to release his tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie was on stage for 16 minutes at the end of the speech before he mentioned Romney. Sixteen minutes before he says Romney's name. He's on the stage for 30 seconds and he mentioned Breyer's Ice cream.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all watched the Republican Convention last night. Just pretend. That's good. We got to hear from Mitt Romney's wife Ann. She spoke at the convention. People said she did a good job, I thought she did a good job with her speech at the convention. Ann Romney talked about meeting Mitt at a dance. That's true. Yeah, apparently she leaned over to her girlfriends and said, 'Who's the guy over there with no rhythm?' He was doing the robot. Or as it was called then, 'The Mitt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting, during her speech, Ann Romney said after they got married, she and Mitt lived in a basement. Yeah. It was a 42-room basement on the French Riviera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big event last night, Chris Christie gave the key note address. Yeah. In his speech last night, Chris Christie said the word 'I' 37 times, 'Romney' seven times and 'jobs' only once. Yeah. And then there was the 622 times he said the word 'ham.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said there's going to be a mystery speaker at the convention. It's been rumored the Republican convention mystery speaker is going to be a hologram of Ronald Reagan. I'm not lying. That's true, yeah. And the cool part is he's going to perform a duet with Tupac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people talking about the Republican platform. That's the big part of the convention. The platform. The new Republican Party platform calls for a crackdown on porn. Yeah, yeah. The Republicans say they'll start the porn crackdown right after they check out of their Tampa hotels with unlimited pay-per-view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the Republican convention, a group of conservative gays threw a party called Homo-Con. Homo-Con, yeah. People said it's like Comic-Con but less gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday a medical marijuana group officially endorsed President Obama for President. Doesn't really help Obama though, because they were just getting around to endorsing him for 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back in the Corporations are People Republic of Tampa the Republicans faced the difficult challenge of their own. Could they find someone who could make America love Mitt Romney? Well, listen, you [Ann Romney] seem kind of charming so I can get why he's into you. But unless there's time in this campaign for Mitt Romney to take us all to a dance I don't think the love thing is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Reince Priebus' RNC speech] &quot;I gotta say, if the tone you were going for there was angry drunk guy -- you nailed it. You know what? I'm beginning to think this guy's name isn't Reince Priebus, it's Ryan Peterson and he's always too [bleep] up when he says it to people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight is, of course, the second-ish night of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, and folks, I am jacked! And not just because I've been playing this drinking game where I take a shot of Jack every time I see an old white man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, every night this week has a different theme. Last night's theme was 'We built it.' 'It,' being, I assume Mitt Romney. I always wondered who assembled him because that is quality work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, hey, unemployed people out there, we already know that there were years when the Romneys didn't work-- because they didn't need to. As Ann told the 'Boston Globe,' 'Neither one of us had a job because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time.' So hard. They were living hand-to-phone-to-stockbroker-to-mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, folks. As you know, we tape earlier, so we haven't seen it yet, but apparently Clint Eastwood was the mystery guest tonight at the Republican convention. Clint Eastwood. Finally, a senior citizen who scares Paul Ryan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paul Ryan also said America needs a turnaround, to which Chick-fil-A said, 'Hey, we don't go for that kind of thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Paul Ryan is getting criticized today for his speech. The facts checkers say it was full of inaccuracies and misinformation. See, that's what was great about Sarah Palin. When she was a nominee, she never deliberately misstated a fact. She did it out of pure ignorance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting fact. Some political analysts are saying the reason you saw more minorities than usual seated up front was because Republicans are trying to make their party look more like America, so they put them up front. Forget diversity. If Republicans want to make their party look more like America, put the unemployed people up front, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a man in Riviera Beach, Florida has been arrested for wearing a President Obama mask while robbing a McDonald's. Had an Obama mask on robbing a McDonald's. To show you how good this guy's disguise was, instead of a holdup note, he was reading from a teleprompter. This Obama robber made some pretty scary threats to the McDonald employees. He said, 'Give me your money, or else my economic plan will have you working here for the rest of your life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans believe that wealthy people in this country are not paying enough in taxes. The rest are all down at the convention in Tampa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people celebrating Labor Day this weekend. Except, of course, the people who have to buy gasoline. Oh, my God. Gas is so expensive now. For the first time ever, you can hear English spoken on city buses. That's how high gas is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen, Labor Day Weekend, huh? Are you excited about Labor Day weekend? That's a holiday, of course, where Americans take three days off from looking for a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been enjoying the Republican convention? Well, tonight's the final night and it's over but you know I think the USA did a great job as host country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There in the address, Governor Christie says Mitt Romney will tell the hard truths. Mitt Romney will tell the hard truths. Yeah, except about his tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Ann Romney's speech this? She was very compelling. Ann Romney was great. She said it's all about love, Ann Romney. Then Chris Christie followed up by saying 'It's not about love, it's about respect.' Will you people get on the same damn page? For the love of God which is it? Is it love or respect? How am I going to figure out who I'm voting for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney, of course, his acceptance speech earlier tonight, very nervous guy at his own convention. Before the convention he was backstage fanning himself with $100 bills. In his speech Romney reached out to women, he reached out to blacks, he reached out to Latinos. No one reached back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. Rush Limbaugh is saying that Hurricane Isaac is an Obama conspiracy. Well, there's no doubt about it, Rush is back on the Oxycontin. Back on the Oxycontin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight is the last night, the final night of the Republican National Convention. Tonight it's the swimsuit competition, actually. It's been reported the Republican convention decided not to show a hologram of Ronald Reagan for fear it would overshadow Mitt Romney. Yeah. It's never a good sign when your candidate is in danger of being overshadowed by something that technically doesn't make a shadow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Condoleezza Rice spoke last night. Some people were distracted by her speech because she had lipstick on her teeth. You see that? And even more distracted the night before when Chris Christie had a rack of ribs on his chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan gave the big speech last night. Last night Paul ryan during his speech said his iPod playlist, quote, 'Starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin.' When asked for comment, Mitt Romney said, 'Man, I thought I was white.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A former Navy SEAL has a book out that claims Osama bin Laden was unarmed when he was shot. Yeah. The book is called 'Who cares? He's dead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Ryan's speech] &quot;Perhaps you would like to expand on this week's theme, that any successful business is solely the result of individual achievement. ... Let me get this straight. So if your dry cleaning business succeeds with a Democrat in office, you built that, but if your dry cleaning business fails with a Democrat in office, the government [bleep] you. So show me more hard truths. That sounds like it just is a convenient truth. You know, at this point in his speech I would settle for any truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it is Thursday, the third and final and also fourth night of the Republican National Convention. Tonight, Mitt Romney officially accepts the nomination. I haven't seen his, I haven't seen his acceptance speech, but I know it was electric, or at least static electric. He is going to have to be good because last night was a barn burner and not just because the GOP wants to cut funding to fire departments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course the real star of the evening was vice presidential American Paul Ryan who delivered the speech of a lifetime. It not only brought the audience to its feet but also finally earned him that public speaking merit badge. He made Eagle Scout!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the lame extreme nitpick patrol are now saying that there were other times that Ryan misrepresented the facts in his speech. Here's when they say he was lying. Right ? there -- when he starts, when he starts moving his lips. Right there, right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Mitt Romney on his purchase of the Republican presidential nomination. Let me tell you how significant this is. Last night, as he officially accepted the nomination, white smoke billowed from the chimney of the Bank of Switzerland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a month August has been. We've gone from Prince Harry in Vegas to Dirty Harry in Tampa. What was that? How's that for a big surprise? Turns out the big mystery guest was Clint Eastwood's imaginary friend last night.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know something -- after that whole Eastwood debacle last night, I bet the Democrats are thankful their party doesn't have any cozy relationships with Hollywood celebrities like the Republicans do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After watching Clint Eastwood last night -- be honest, be honest. Sarah Palin is not looking too bad now, is she?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, last night at the convention, the scheduled appearance of a three-dimensional Ronald Reagan hologram was cancelled the last minute. Well, of course they canceled 3-D hologram. Of course they canceled it. They didn't want to upstage Mitt Romney. He's only one-dimensional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democrats are getting ready for their convention next week in North Carolina. Or as they're telling Joe Biden, South Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama told magazines that if he's elected this November, it'll be like 'popping the blister in Washington.' Popping the blister. What happened to all that soaring oratory we heard from this guy? Remember? Remember 'stopping the tides from rising?' 'Bending the arc of history.' Now we're popping blisters? What are you doing next? Busting zits? Is that the next thing on the list?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That same interview, President Obama said he did not do a good enough job selling his policies to the American people. Well, duh. It's hard to sell people something when they don't have any money!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and in Florida -- in Florida, a 22-year-old man was arrested for robbing a McDonald's restaurant wearing a Barack Obama mask. He told the cops the robbery was justified because, apparently, the restaurant owner made more than $250,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always like how the politicians show that they're just regular guys. Like Obama likes to have a beer with people. And Romney says when it comes to shopping, he chooses Costco. Yeah. In fact, last week, he bought three of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was admittedly a little down last night, from being here [Tampa] this whole week, a little dispirited. And then-- no, no--and then it happened. Yes! Amidst the tired rhetoric, empty platitudes and overwrought attacks, a fistful of awesome emerged in the night where it spent 12 minutes on the most important night of Mitt Romney's life, yelling at a chair. ... Are you not entertained? This is the most joy I've gotten from an old man since Dick Cheney non-fatally shot one in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am going to tell you something, back where we work at the 'Daily Show' on the west side of Hell's Kitchen in New York City, you don't have to go far to see an old man yelling at an inanimate object. But rarely is that object on stage at a national political convention. And almost never is that old man Oscar winner Clint Eastwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not that Romney didn't get a chance to-- you know, I think he talked too. I don't care how many Marco Rubios you put in between Clint Eastwood and Mitt Romney, Romney ain't outshining this little playlet I like to call the 'Old Man and the Seat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's why it hurts. It hurt these Republicans bad because this convention like all conventions is a scripted and focused group fantasy. And the display of Eastwood's 'Grand Torino' id was the very thing Republicans had constructed the entire week to suppress. This convention was the vision of a perfect America that used to exist until Barack Obama ruined it, and so what if that America had never actually existed? ... What this convention attempted to do is say that we could all live again in this nostalgic paradise if it weren't for this one [bleep] guy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, in four years, one man, Barack Obama has broken the greatest nation God has ever given the earth. The message of this convention is that apparently up until around November of 2008 Americans lived in a utopian ideal born of our own gumption and individual hard work but sadly now, not four years later it is a socialist hellscape with jack-booted thugs locking you up for thinking about Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that is where Clint Eastwood has done a huge favor to us all. Because the Republican Party's irrationality that they have worked so hard at the convention trying to conceal was unleashed in a 12 minute improvised avant-garde performance of 'One Angry Men.' Eastwood finally revealed the cognitive dissonance that is the beating heart and soul and fiction of this party. He's so far gone they are hammering Obama for things Bush did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We owe Clint Eastwood a debt of thanks. Not only because it was a truly hilarious 12 minutes of improvised awesome in a week of scripted blah, but because it advanced our understanding. This President has issues and there are very legitimate debates to be had about his policies and actions and successes and or failures as President. I mean tune in next week. But I could never wrap my head around why the world and the President that Republicans describe bear so little resemblance to the world and the President that I experience. And now I know why. There is a President Obama that only Republicans can see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the final evening of the Republican national convention and, of course, they saved the last for last. Mitt Romney did a great job. There was never any doubt that this man was going to stick the landing because he never left the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, all agree that Mitt Romney is a solid. Matter cannot pass through him. And he does not conform to the shape of his container. And folks, solid was all Mitt needed to be. It's true, during the primaries we heard so much about Mitt's electability but not about his plausibility. I mean just look at him, he's plausible. I mean who needs 'Yes We Can?' The Republicans have 'Yes, We Can Imagine the Scenario Where This Could Happen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, a clear triumph after nearly a decade of working toward this moment. Mitt, the nominee was on the front page of all the papers like the 'USA Today.' We deserve better. And of course-- and of course Rupert Murdoch's conservative 'New York Post' had him splashed across the lower right 16th edge in what many call the 'Snooki corner.' The rest of the page, of course, was dedicated to a more dynamic speaker, an empty chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see-- you see, folks, the deal is that all week there have been rumors that Thursday night would feature a surprise. Was it Sarah Palin? Was it a hologram Reagan? Was it me? Sadly no. Evidently I learned how to belch the Second Amendment for nothing. Well, last night we finally got our answer. It was Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood carrying on a conversation with an invisible Obama in an empty chair. And having watched last night's mystery speaker I can say with some confidence, the mystery remains. ... Folks, there has not been a political speech this powerful since the famous Lincoln-Bookshelf debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hope you all had a nice holiday. Yesterday, of course, was Labor Day. Or as the White House calls it, 'April Fool's Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, AAA reports the number of people on the road this Labor Day weekend increased 10% from last year. Actually, the increase is due mostly from strippers driving from the Republican convention in Tampa up to Charlotte.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democratic convention began tonight. See, this one's a little different. At this convention, they'll actually mention President Bush. Yeah, so this is different than the last one.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a difference four years makes. Last time, the theme was 'Hope and Change.' This year, the theme is 'Hope You Don't Make a Change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first two nights at the Democratic convention are at the Time Warner Cable Arena. The big speech by the President Obama will be at the Bank of America stadium. Well, that's good thinking. The two things Americans love most -- cable companies and banks, really. I mean, think about it. What are the odds of that? They gave the Bank of America a $45 billion bailout, and they give the speech there. I'm stunned. You thought the Republicans are too close to the banks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And much like the Republicans, the Democrats are also going to have a mystery speaker. I believe it's Mitt Romney's dog. He will speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two California Democratic delegates have already been kicked out of the convention for getting completely drunk. Completely drunk. One passed out. The other was accused of impersonating a member of Congress. Well, they knew he wasn't a real member of Congress because he was buying his own drinks with his money. So they knew right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very excited. We have Ron Paul on the show tonight. And unlike the Republicans, we're actually going to let him speak. Yeah. I'll tell you, that's got to be -- that had to be rough for Ron Paul. You run for President. You win a bunch of delegates. Not only is he not allowed to speak; he couldn't even sit down because they gave his chair to Clint Eastwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Labor Day yesterday. Did you have nice Labor Day? It's the day we honor the American worker. When I say an American worker I mean an eight-year-old kid in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never know what to believe in politics. But what he's [Obama] been doing lately is spending his free time in the White House making beer. And apparently the beer is so good that the White House is now releasing the recipe for the beer. Yes. Not to be outdone, Mitt Romney, Republican candidate for President pretty soon will be releasing his own recipe for root beer. I wish somebody would release the recipe for fixing the economy!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week the Democratic convention takes place in Charlotte, North Carolina. And one of the speakers will be Bill Clinton. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, out of habit Clinton told Hillary that he was nowhere near Charlotte. He doesn't know who Charlotte is and Charlotte is a liar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's event at the Democratic National Convention includes a speech by Michelle Obama. Everyone's favorite moment was when she told Ann Romney to 'Bring it, bitch.'&quot; That's a quote. I saw it and I'm reporting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a donor to President Obama's campaign ? donors were promised exclusive access to Joe Biden and for an extra $10,000 absolutely no access to Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;DC Comics has unveiled its first Arab-American superhero. Yeah, he's the first superhero who has the power to fly but keeps getting pulled over for questioning by the TSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gotta talk about the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. They're going all out to make sure it tops last week's Republican convention. In fact, I heard that at this one, they're gonna have Clint Eastwood yell at a couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that nine of the hotels being used for politicians at the Democratic National Convention have bed bugs. Yeah. When asked what it's like dealing with thousands of ruthless blood suckers, the bed bugs are like 'Yeah, it's okay. We'll deal with it. We get by.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for joining us. Sit down everybody. I tell you, I tell you folks. What Barack Obama would give for enthusiasm like that. Tonight we launch our coverage of the 2012 People's Party Congress of Charlotte. This year they are hoping for a replay of four years ago when hoards of hope-addled lemmings cried as their dear leader orated between soaring Greek columns. Four years ago those were fake Greek columns. This time it's the actual Parthenon. Greece sold it for a $1.75 and a jug of tzatziki.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, tonight's DNC dis-info-tainment line up features Rahm Emanuel, Harry Reid, Jimmy Carter, First Lady Michelle Obama and congressional candidate Joaquin Castro and his twin brother San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. I mean call me racist but I cannot tell these Hispanics apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Democratic National Convention got started in Charlotte, North Carolina tonight. What a bunch of nerds. ... Political conventions are a fun place to go if you have no fun places to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;This is kind of funny, on Saturday, the White House released President Obama's personal recipes for a home-brewed beer. That's how bad the economy is. Not only is our President drinking, he's drinking beer he made in his bathtub. The President makes two different kinds of beer. The White House honey brown ale and White House honey porter. ... Meanwhile, Mitt Romney released his special beer recipe today. It's milk. It's 2%, room temperature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, there's a report today that says he selected his official Secret Service code name. Each of the candidates have a code name. President Obama is called Renegade. Vice President Biden goes by Celtic. Mitt Romney is known as Javelin, and Paul Ryan has selected Bowhunter as his code name. Watch out Bo, the White House dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day if you love conventions. And who doesn't? The Democratic National Convention is underway. For three days in Charlotte, North Carolina, everything the Democrats do is good. And everything Republicans do is evil. It doesn't bother me. I live in Hollywood. It is like that here every day. I've been to Charlotte. It has a great NASCAR track. I think that's why the Democrats picked it. They love anything that forces you to turn left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later in the week, former Democratic nominee John Kerry is going to give a speech about foreign policy. It will be like Clint Eastwood's speech. Except this time the empty chairs will be in the audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope they go easy on Clint Eastwood. I watched that thing. I admit, it wasn't his best performance last week at the Republican convention, but he's given us decades of great films. So Democrats, if you're looking to mock Mitt Romney by dragging an inanimate object out onto the stage, why not just use Mitt Romney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Bill Clinton wants to improvise, just like Clint Eastwood. It will not be the same. If Bill brings a chair on stage, it's only because he's going to get a lap dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it is day two of the Democratic convention and -- oh, this is interesting. Apparently they had a huge lighting problem in the convention hall today. They worked all day on it. They still couldn't get President Obama out of Bill Clinton's shadow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the stoner comedy duo -- you know Harold and Kumar? Well, they're starring in a new promo for the Democratic convention alongside President Obama, which is pretty impressive. I mean, think about it. The only other person to go from smoking pot with their buddies to the White House is President Obama.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the manager of President Obama's reelection campaign said that this year we'll knock on 150% more doors than we did in 2008. Well, of course they will. They have to. There's so many foreclosures it's tough to tell where people live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech last night, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro said that Mitt Romney has no idea how good he's had it. See, I don't think that's true. I think Mitt Romney knows how good he's had it. He just doesn't want us to know how good he's had it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they announced today that they are moving President Obama's speech tomorrow night indoors. They're gonna move it from the 74,000-seat stadium to a smaller venue, due to the possibility of severe weather. See, apparently the campaign is concerned about this well-known weather phenomenon known as empty seats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently last week the Republicans had originally planned to have a Ronald Reagan three-dimensional hologram speak at the convention. Did you hear that? Yeah. They decided against it. I guess they were concerned that Reagan would come across as more lifelike than Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So last week was the Republican convention, and now is the Democratic convention. Of course, there's a day or two off between the two conventions which is travel day for hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw First Lady Michelle Obama's speech last night at the Democratic National Convention? It was powerful. I was happy to see it. It was exhilarating. It was thrilling. It was motivating. And I-- at the end of the speech, I thought, 'Whoa, boy. She could do much better than him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, last week at the Republican convention, no one mentioned the Tea Party. Were you surprised by that? I mean, I remember when it was nothing but the Tea Party, and they were having rallies, and they'd go out and they'd have Tea Party gatherings. And then they would have Tea Party rallies. And then after that, they'd go someplace for a gathering. It was wall-to-wall Tea Party. That's all you heard about, Tea Party. Not one person at the Republican convention mentioned the Tea Party. And listen to this. If it wasn't for Ann Romney, nobody at the Republican convention would have mentioned Mitt. It's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Reasons To Watch The Democratic National Convention [Presented by Michelle Obama]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Spoiler alert: The Democrats will nominate Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It's like having a crowded convention center right in your own living room</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. You don't have to be a Democrat to enjoy balloons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Finally, you get to see some coverage of the presidential campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As a healthy alternative, we're using low-fat confetti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. If you were appearing at a national political convention, I'd watch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There will be no kiss cam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It's got to better than what you're watching now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Joe Biden says it'll be 'A big' you-know-what 'deal'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At long last, I'll reveal who I'm voting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic National Convention began last night. Two of the speakers at the Democratic convention were identical twin brothers, Joaquin and Julian Castro. Identical twins, did you see them? Promising identical twins was the only way to get Bill Clinton to show up. Man, was he disappointed!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Democrats added the word 'God' to the official party platform. Yeah, yeah. It's in the part that reads 'Did you see Michelle Obama's biceps, oh, my God!' Did you see those guns on her? She could beat the crap out of me in two seconds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She gave a great speech last night. Michelle Obama said the first car Barack picked her up in was so old, you could see the ground below them. Yeah. Today, Ann Romney said the same thing about Mitt's helicopter. In her speech, she gave away some nice details about their family life. First Lady Michelle Obama said her husband has dinner with his girls where they strategize about middle school relationships. That explains why today the Pentagon ordered a drone strike on that lying bitch Ashley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fun fact, at this year's Democratic convention, 8% of the delegates are gay, a historic record, 8%. This will be the first time a presidential candidate will be nominated by a show of jazz hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama is receiving praise for the speech she gave last night at the Democratic National Convention. Everyone was impressed, even Fox News called it 'not the worst.' That's very nice of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the DNC, earlier in the night actor Kal Penn told viewers to use the Twitter hash tag 'sexy face' when talking about his speech. Which got weird when Bill Clinton was like 'There goes the first line of my speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama's speech at the DNC has been moved inside to the Time Warner Arena, due to weather concerns. You can tell it's Time Warner, 'cause Obama will give the speech two weeks from Friday, between the hours of 12 and 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA is holding a contest that lets high school students choose a name for an asteroid. Though it'll be weird when there's a breaking news report like, 'This just in, the asteroid Harry Butts is headed towards earth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;According to the latest ABC News/'Washington Post' poll over the past five months, President Obama's popularity has dropped seven points. Right now, Obama has the lowest popularity of any incumbent President going into a convention since the '80s; 49% see him unfavorably. And Clint Eastwood doesn't see him at all. No other job do you get to find out how many people think you suck three times a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton asked the age-old question: Are we better off now than we were four years ago? He said -- [as Bill Clinton] 'Yes, I am. Cause Hillary's always out of the country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is 11:00 on the East Coast. I imagine the Cowboys game is wrapping up and tonight's Democratic headline speaker Bill Clinton is about a quarter of the way through. [As Bill Clinton] 'You remember my tax relief bill in' 98? You don't? Let me recite it to you from memory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, if you tuned in last night, not only would you have gotten a strong dose of supposedly Republican-owned themes of family values, self-reliance and faith, the Democrats even threw in some bonus patriotism, including talk of military families, sacrifice, and actual war heroes! In much the same way that last week the Republicans loaded up their stage with diversity to fight the notion they're a party of white guys. Last night, the Democrats pushed back on their stereotype with so many soldiers and clergymen you could almost forget you were watching the Democratic convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Democrats had the diversity angle well covered by filling the convention hall with Democrats. Yet, black people, Asians, Sikhs, Jews, Muslims, hippies! Veterans! Babies! 1940s boxing reporters! 1840s sheriffs! Native Americans! Gay service droids! Muppet Americans and, of course, Newman! Hello, Newman! By the way, that was real. Newman was actually there. How effortlessly diverse is the Democratic Party? Remember the folks at the RNC over rising Latino star Marco Rubio? The Democrats have not only a rising Latino star in San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, they have an extra one of him in case he breaks! It's unbelievable! Democrats have so many Latinos they've got doubles! Collect them all, trade with your friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was night one of the Democratic National Drum Circle last night. And I am sad to say it was a disaster. First of all, it was beset with technical difficulties starting with the audio. All night there was this constant buzzing roar It's hard to describe. [cheers and applause] Yeah! Yeah! That was it! What was that? You can barely hear the speeches. They didn't have that problem at the Republican convention, I'll tell you. They know how to do audio. ... That was cacophony of unbridled enthusiasm! They [the Democratic delegates] seemed unable to mute their joy! And I'm sorry, that volume of pleasure is just unprofessional. The Fox News people could barely hear themselves saying it sucked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sound system was not the only problem. There were also the people talking over it. Speeches by Deval Patrick, Kathleen Sebelius, Joaquin and Julian Castro. Two Castros? Can we now end the debate on whether the Dems are socialists, please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the headliner from Michelle -- wait for it -- Obama. Oh, I wonder how she got that gig? Crony capitalism, Solyndra. She came out and talked about the President's character, their life together, their children. Meow, meow, meow. I'm not going to get into a lot of details about her speech because it was very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well folks, both conventions are finally over, and if you watched, I think it's pretty clear who should be the next President of the United States. Bill Clinton! How about that? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Clinton's speech last night? He was unbelievable. According to the Democrats, he won the election for Obama, he helped the Cowboys beat the Giants, even had time to go to Hooters afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, it was quite a speech. Bill Clinton spent 50 minutes praising Obama's accomplishments as president. Imagine how long they would have talked if they actually liked each other.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said that Obama inherited a deeply damaged economy. And if he's reelected, he'll inherit an even more deeply damaged economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, well ? while Bill Clinton was in North Carolina talking about American jobs, Hillary was in southeast Asia visiting American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's speech tonight was moved from the Bank of America Stadium to Time Warner Cable Arena. They had to move out of a big venue to a smaller place, like a lot of homeowners in the past four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact in a related story - Vice President Joe Biden's speech was also moved tie small venue, the back room at Denny's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got some bad economic news. The United States has slipped down the global ranking in the most competitive economy. We're now seventh. We're number seven. The number one economy in the world, Switzerland. Switzerland is number one. To which Mitt Romney said, 'See, that's why I keep my money there. It's so much safer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard the story? Computer hackers claim to have stolen Mitt Romney's tax returns. And they're willing to leak them publicly unless the Romney campaign pays them a million dollars. This is such an unethical money-making scheme that Mitt Romney said he was quite impressed. 'I could use these guys at Bain Capital. See if they're available.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the signature question of this presidential campaign is, 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' As a comedian, I have to say no. I miss Bush and Cheney. They were the golden age. I wish they were here. I am not better off. I am not better off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while on the campaign trail this week, President Obama stopped by a Virginia firehouse and dropped off a case of his White House brewed beer. You know that beer that they made ? he gave it to the firemen, which I think is great. So, now instead of wasting people's tax dollars, tax dollars are going toward getting people wasted. I think that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know whose birthday it is today? New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Happy birthday to Chris Christie ladies and gentlemen. Fifty years old. Had a big party for him and they had a cake for him and he blew out the candles and he wished for another cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard in this announcement on the radio. Because of Chris Christie's birthday cake there will be...on the eastern sea board for another couple days there will be a frosting shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen, remember last week the surprise speaker at the Republican convention was Clint Eastwood? And he came out and... And I thought it was tremendous. I mean, you don't often see stuff like that anywhere. Except maybe on the subway you'll see that occasionally. But Clint Eastwood, I mean... Fantastic!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night Bill Clinton gave a 49-minute speech defending Obama's record. That's what he did, yeah. He praised Obama for saving the economy, passing healthcare, and keeping Hillary out of the country most of the year, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington and Eva Longoria all spoke at the Democratic convention. This means that Obama has all about clinched the crucial 13-year-old boy vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new Republican ad that just came out. The election is going to get nasty toward the end. That's my prediction. The Republican ad shows a young woman breaking up with a cardboard cutout of President Obama. Yeah, the ad ends with her choosing a cardboard cutout of Mitt Romney which turns out to actually be Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figures are in and Michelle Obama's convention speech got higher ratings than Ann Romney's. Yeah. And tonight, tonight the Democrats are aiming even higher when President Obama is introduced by new DNC Chair Honey Boo-Boo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I mentioned former president Bill Clinton spoke last night at the DNC. The crowd loved him. They really did. Some Democrats are worried that Clinton might be overshadowing President Obama. I got to tell you, after watching Clinton's speech last night, I can understand their concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton spoke at the Democratic National Convention last night and gave the audience several key numbers on the economy. Which is weird since usually Clinton is the one trying to get numbers from people, so that's an interesting move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton also described President Obama as cool on the outside, but burning for America on the inside. And he introduced his new speech writer, Danielle Steel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this last night? Monica Lewinsky's former rabbi gave the benediction after Bill Clinton spoke at the DNC, which explains when he started with that Hebrew phrase, 'aw-chhhhh- ward.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know, this Democratic National Convention wraps up in Charlotte tonight. There were a lot of speeches, touting president Obama's accomplishments since he took office and Osama bin Laden is dead and the oil industry has pulled through pretty well. But in 2008 there was no Snooki and no Honey Boo Boo. Snooki even had a child and someone has to be held accountable. That's my take on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mrs. Clinton watched her husband's speech via computer. This photograph has been widely circulated online today. They seem so happy together when they're not together, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There were a lot of celebrities at the convention. Jessica Alba, Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington gave a speech. Scarlet Johansson spoke. President Clinton must have been going nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;But Kim Kardashian is reportedly in Charlotte to attend the DMC after party. Not because she was invited. Federal law requires that a Kardashian be there at any after-party in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for Bill Clinton. Everyone is still talking about his speech last night in Charlotte. It was a remarkable speech. 45 minutes long. 6,000 words. Like the political version of the guitar solo from 'Freebird.' He really threw it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Republicans admit today that Clinton was great. He really nailed them. Just pounded away. Really stuck it. People's minds were blown. I ran out of double entendres.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night at his speech, President Obama invoked FDR. Then he saw the unemployment numbers and invoked WTF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems there were only 96,000 jobs added in the last month. Only 96,000. And half of those were strippers working the conventions.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney described today's job report as 'disappointing.' And you could just see the disappointment in Romney's face. Oh, he was so disappointed. He would be so much happier with 12 million new jobs, 100% employment and absolutely zero chance of then winning the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, when it came to hope and change, president Obama told the crowd last night, 'You were the change.' Then the crowd goes, 'Hey, don't blame us, you were supposed to be the change. I didn't do anything! I just voted. Why is it my fault?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a Federal judge has upheld Arizona's 'show me your papers' law. So, I want to say to any illegal aliens who have been living in Arizona, welcome to LA. Nice to have you here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I asked the ATM for $20, and the ATM said, 'I was going to ask you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I saw Mitt Romney at the supermarket buying lobster helper. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Clint Eastwood talked to a chair while going through the cushions looking for spare change. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Chick-Fil-A is now offering to cater gay weddings. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;125 students at Harvard University are being investigated for possible cheating on the final exam to a class called 'Introduction to Congress.' Well, what better introduction to congress could there be than cheating on the exam?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats spent the first two nights of their convention highlighting their very distinct vision of America, where citizens of all races and creed work together to defraud real Americans of their hard-earned?sorry about that. Uh, help each other succeed together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden gave a powerful speech, emphasizing his blue collar roots, his strong family ties and, of course, his physical proximity to the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It is refreshing now to finally be in the homestretch of this election. Doesn't it feel like this election has been going on for about nine years? Going on forever. Now we're in the homestretch and candidates are pulling out all of the stops. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the latest. Mitt Romney released another ad that features Hispanic voters speaking in Spanish. Have you seen it? Yeah, the ad ends with him saying, 'I'm Mitt Romney, and I have no idea what these people are saying.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;The candidates are trying to scare people. This weekend Mitt Romney suggested President Obama wants to remove the phrase 'In God we trust' from US coins. Yeah. Or as Romney calls coins, 'These jingling things you people have.' He thinks they're candy.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Obama spent the weekend campaigning in Florida. He's trying to woo senior citizens. Wants to get senior citizens behind them, yeah. Which may be why Obama starts his speeches in Florida with, 'Hi, I'm President Eisenhower with a tan.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday in Florida, President Obama visited a pizzeria. Did you see this footage? Where the owner gave the President a bear hug and lifted him off his feet. Yeah. Everybody shared a good laugh and the Secret Service shot the man in the face.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;I don't know if you saw '60 Minutes' last night, one of the Navy SEALs was speaking who was involved in the bin Laden raid and he said the first thing he did when he got home was go to Taco Bell. Yeah. So apparently, bin Laden wasn't the only one that night who [bleep]ed his pants.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Yesterday, Paul Ryan said that he and Mitt Romney won't reveal their tax plan to the public until after the election. Other politicians couldn't believe it. They were like, 'At least do the honorable thing and lie.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;A new poll shows that President Obama has expended his lead over Mitt Romney since the Democratic National Convention. Of course, it didn't help Obama as much as that other event, the Republican National Convention.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;In Chicago today after contract negotiations broke down unexpectedly 26,000 public school schoolteachers walked off the job and went on strike, the first teachers' strike they had in 25 years. Teachers are calling it a 'last resort.' City officials are saying it's 'unnecessary' and 'wrong' and students are calling it 'awesome.' Almost every kid in Chicago gets to skip school. It's like there are 400,000 Ferris Buellers loose on the street and we don't have enough parades for them to dance in.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;Meanwhile, President Obama was in Florida campaigning. Yesterday he visited the Big Apple Pizza and Pasta restaurant in Fort Pierce. When he got there he met the owner of the restaurant, that big guy who was very excited to meet the President. He kept shaking his hand, he wanted to hug him. Even kind like put him in some kind of an arm lock there. You can see he was so excited he truly went ahead, not only to hug him, he lifted the President off the ground and that became the photo of the day. That's not a hug. That's a Heimlich. Hard to believe the Secret Service let him get that close and even harder to believe Michelle let him in a pizza place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That no one should want.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Over the weekend Mitt Romney made an appearance at a NASCAR race in Virginia. There was an awkward moment when he asked a NASCAR driver why he didn't just hire a chauffeur.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Mitt Romney is not backing down from his statement that America's number one foe is Russia. Then he said America's number one band is Duran Duran and the number one movie is 'The Goonies.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Yesterday, Nicki Minaj revealed that in her new song, she only sarcastically endorsed Mitt Romney. Or as Republicans put it, 'Wow, you too?'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Actually, members of Mitt Romney's own party are starting to criticize him for being too vague. When asked if that bothers him, Romney was like, 'Maybe.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;. A new CNN poll shows that President Obama now has a six-point lead over Mitt Romney. You can tell that Romney's very depressed. Last night, he just sat on his couch and bought the Haagen-Dazs Corporation.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;President Obama got a big endorsement today. Snoop Lion the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg has endorsed Barack Obama's re-election campaign and he also endorsed a sleeve of Samoa Girl Scout cookies. ? I have to say I'm a little surprised. I've always known Snoop to have his mind on his money and his money on his mind and that's more of a Mitt Romney thing. ? And don't worry Team Romney; Coolio's vote is still up for grabs.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;.Over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden hung out with a biker gang in Ohio. When I saw that, I thought to myself, I don't know if that's wise. It's not always a good idea to be associating with shady characters. So next time, think twice, bikers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The biggest change was Obama had Clinton use the phrase 'Americans' instead of 'All you fine honeys.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;This week an 81-year-old woman modeled in a fashion show for New York fashion week.

Yeah. And as soon as Ryan said no, Romney was like, 'I found my man.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Speaking of Romney, a new poll found that most Americans think President Obama will beat Mitt Romney in the debates. In response, Romney said, 'Yeah? Well - I'll think of something later.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;In more campaign news, yesterday in Nevada, President Obama said he'll win the election if the turnout is anything like it was in 2008. While voters said he'd win if he were anything like he was in 2008.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;There's a new poll out today, it claims that 58% of Americans believe Barack Obama would beat Mitt Romney in a fistfight. The research was done by Yahoo! and the Institute of Things No One Was Wondering About. I didn't realize a fistfight between them was an option. Maybe we can wrap this election up tonight.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Labor Department, unemployment fell from 8.3% to 8.1% last month. But that was because, that's because 368,000 Americans gave up looking for work. Today, President Obama said that's a step in the right direction, and he is encouraging more Americans to give up looking for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know, anti-American crowds have been protesting and burning American flags over that anti-Islamic film -- have you heard about this anti-Islamic film? And the US now bracing for more protests next week when the film comes out on Blu-ray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something! I'm watching the news, and I see these protesters in countries like Egypt, Afghanistan, Tunisia. They're all burning American flags.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it seems like every time you turn on news, all over the world, people are chanting, 'Death to America.' Except in China, where they're chanting, 'Not until we get our money back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was down in Washington DC for the Conservative Values Voters Summit. Not exactly a gala affair. For some reason the group fighting to deny gay people rights has trouble finding a competent party planner. But I tell you this, it is a great place to hear from prominent conservative voices like Jan Brewer, Kirk Cameron, Eric Cantor and a 9-millimeter firing at a disk of birth-control pills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On Rick Santorum's Values Voters Comments] &quot;It is high time that the GOP stops trying to appeal to smart people. And letting Rick Santorum in front of a microphone is a great place to start. Folks, the rest of the party needs to fall in line. Do you hear that Michele Bachmann -- dumb it down! Nation, it's about time somebody said what we were all not thinking. Just because people know things doesn't mean we should listen to them. Sorry, elites, but we've given your pro-knowledge wisdom-pushing policies a chance and they have failed. F-A-L-7-D, failed. And this is a wake-up call to all anti-intellectual Americans. I'm not talking just about the dumb people. I'm talking to the droolers. The mouth breathers -- those struggling to finish the kid's maze on a Long John's Silvers placement. Stand up, shake that bucket off your head and be counted. Unfortunately, to do that you'll have to find someone who can count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now folks, I may not agree with what this film says, but I will fight to the death for its right to say it. Obviously, minus the 'I fight' and 'death' part. And folks, I have decided not to play the film out of sensitivity to me still living. But let me try to calm the global situation. Muslim viewers, I have viewed the video on YouTube. It combines the production values of a basement porno, the acting talent of an 18th-century syphilis sanatorium, and a script transcribed from arguments overheard in a bus station bathroom. Not good. But you see, our Constitution means we can't stop people from making movies that are stupid or grossly offensive. For instance, we made three 'Transformers.' Where were the mobs then? Where were the riots? However horrible this movie may be, the American President needs to know when it comes to our values, there can be no apology. I mean, Mitt Romney wrote the book on that, in his book 'No Apology.' So, to all the conservative media out there saying that this foreign policy misstep is a fatal blow to the Romney campaign, let me offer you a no apology condolence card. 'Romney 2012: I'm not sorry for your loss.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Tomorrow, Mitt Romney will be 'Live with Kelly and Michael.' They taped the interview on Friday. At one point, Mitt was asked what he wears to bed and he said 'As little as possible.' Only three pairs of khakis, that's it. As little as possible-- it's the same philosophy that he has in regard to paying taxes. He also admitted on the show that his guilty pleasures are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate milk. Even his guilty pleasures are boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, did you see what happened in Los Angeles last week? During a high speed chase with the cops, bank robbers started tossing all the money out the window of the getaway car. And people were running into the streets scooping it up. But in the people's defense, they didn't know they were bank robbers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thought it was another one of President Obama's stimulus programs.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the new fall TV season has started, and I understand Mitt Romney has a new hidden camera show. Yeah, Mitt Romney said the 47% of people who don't pay taxes are gonna vote for Obama. You know what that means? Mitt Romney is gonna vote for Obama. ? If you take the 47% that Mitt Romney says pay no taxes and add that to the people that Obama says clings to their guns and religion, that's the whole country right there.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, you know, it's odd because all these political strategists have been trying to explain why Mitt Romney can't seem to get his message out. I'm no strategist, but it's hard to talk with both a silver spoon and a foot in your mouth. You know, it's hard. It's a little awkward. It's awkward.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And all of this anti-American rioting all across the globe is causing - is, rather, is casting doubt on President Obama's foreign policy. To give you an idea how bad it's gotten, Obama's now trying to change the subject to economy.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;The economy is so bad; Mitt Romney now is forced to fly his money to the Cayman Islands on coach. That's how bad. The economy is so bad; Clint Eastwood can only afford to talk to patio furniture. That's how bad it's gotten. The economy is so bad; Peyton Manning threw three interceptions just to get some kind of a return.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, yesterday, here in Los Angeles, Mitt Romney spoke to the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Or as we call that in LA, the Chamber of Commerce.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Mitt Romney said 47% of the people are freeloaders and I said to myself, 'Is he talking about my relatives?'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Big controversy for the Romney campaign. Are you following this today? A secretly recorded tape of a fundraiser has emerged. This is what happened, during a private reception with wealthy donors; Mitt Romney said nearly half of Americans pay no income tax. And then he said, 'But enough about me.' It's true. Another thing he said if he had Mexican parents, he would have a better shot at winning. That's what he said. But unfortunately, Romney was tragically held back by being born into the home of rich, white people. There's no getting around that.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;The space shuttle is coming to LA it's going to be towed through downtown Los Angeles at two miles per hour. In other words it will be traveling at the same speed as every other vehicle in LA.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Yesterday, 132 inmates escaped from a prison in Mexico after digging a 23-foot tunnel. Man, if they dug themselves any deeper, they'd be Mitt Romney.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's some campaign news today, President Obama attended a fund-raiser in New York, hosted by Jay-Z and Beyonce. Michelle is hoping Beyonce will get up and sing 'All the Single Ladies.' While Obama is worried Biden will get up and sing 'Bootylicious.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Get this; you guys, in a new interview, First Lady Michelle Obama said that she doesn't think of her family as famous. Yeah, Michelle would have said more but she had to go get ready for dinner with Jay-Z and Beyonce.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;The Romney campaign's reboot was spoiled by footage from last May of Governor Romney at a $50,000 a plate fund-raiser talking to rich people about poorer people in a manner you would imagine cartoon rich people talk about cartoon poorer people.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;And this is a guy whose religion forbids him from drinking alcohol. Can you imagine what he would say if he was [bleep]-faced?&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Folks, Mitt Romney has been dogged all week by his handling of the Libya crisis. But yesterday the Romney people shifted gears to change the game. Well, I'm happy to say that by last night no one was focused on Libya anymore.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;It has been a pretty rough day for Mitt Romney. He is in a little bit of hot water. A little hot water. He's in trouble. Earlier this year he spoke at private at a fundraiser. That's political code for 'rich people fiesta.' No big deal, both parties do it. The candidates get down on their knees and beg old rich bastards for money. It's like kissing babies, except with more drool and poopy diapers. At the fundraiser, somebody secretly taped Mitt Romney doing something insane. What he did was - and this is it. He was saying what he actually believes. I was like 'What the [bleep]?' You can't do that! That is a rookie mistake, mister! If you want to be President, there are two things you can never do. One is say what you really believe. The other is to admit you were born in Kenya. You cannot do these things!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A junior high school chemistry teacher in East Texas has been caught manufacturing and selling crystal meth in the parking lot of the junior high school. Now, police want the guy charged with a felony. The teachers' union wants him reimbursed for the cost of all the supplies. This story has got school officials in Texas outraged. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See what happens when you teach science in school?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, as part of the strategy for the upcoming presidential debates, the Obama campaign is attempting to lower expectations. And believe me, if there's one thing President Obama's been good at lately, it's lowering expectations.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, President Obama's big problem is still the economy. I tell you the economy is bad. The economy is so bad, in Beverly Hills last night; they had a Boone's Farm wine tasting party. That's how bad. The economy is so bad; Mideast protesters are throwing rocks and then asking for them back. The economy is so bad; the only thing keeping Mitt Romney from winning the election is Mitt Romney. That's how bad the economy is.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And Tim Tebow says he has not ruled out running for office. And the Republicans are saying, 'It's not too late. We've got 40 days left. You can jump in right now.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Well, it's fall. You know? Unless you're Mitt Romney, then it's free-fall. Mitt Romney says about half the country is freeloaders, freeloaders. And that includes wealthy politicians who only pay 13% in tax. So-- I like Mitt. Listen to this. He has alienated young people, alienated the old people, alienated women, alienated minorities, alienated gays. I mean, I'm telling you, this takes talent. This guy is plugged in and ready to go.&quot; David Letterman: Top Ten Mitt Romney Pet Peeves About Americans: 10. It's no longer enough just to be good-looking 9. Always whining about the need for food and shelter 8. Not enough guys named 'Mitt' 7. Only a few have genuinely lustrous hair 6. Jealous look they give walking through first class on the way to coach 5. Refuse to get high-paying jobs 4. Always throw a fit when they're fired 3. Servants who feel entitled to occasional eye contact 2. Those who think it's a bad idea to drive with dog strapped to roof of car 1. Wouldn't know a good Chateaubriand if it bit them in the ass. Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's some election news. During a fundraiser with Jay-Z last night, President Obama said that he and the rapper have a lot in common because their wives are more popular than they are. While Jay-Z said they have a lot in common 'cause neither of one of them has a plan to fix the economy.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;During that same fundraiser, President Obama said Beyonce is the best role model for his daughters. Which is why later that night, Michelle said that the couch was the best place for Obama to sleep.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's some more campaign news. In a new interview, Mitt Romney's said that 'Modern Family' is his favorite TV show. He said he especially loves the two guys raising that little girl while they wait for the perfect wives to come along.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;In that same interview, Romney said he doesn't watch 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians.' Because if Romney wanted to see rich people say dumb things on camera, he could just watch himself in that video from the fundraiser again. He's got that covered. He can do that. He's got that covered.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Well, Romney's inability to trounce history's 'worst' President was all scheduled to change this week with a very announced campaign reboot, which as you know involves Mr. Romney taking a paperclip and putting it into a hole. I don't want to talk about it.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Folks, now my fellow conservatives have turned on Mitt, everybody from Bill Kristol to Scott Brown to Linda McMahon to Susana Martinez to Peggy Noonan who wrote 'It's time to admit the Romney campaign is an incompetent one.' Wrong, Peggy. That time was six months ago.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;What are they [conservative Romney critics] talking about? Romney has given very specific figures. For instance, he is willing to piss off exactly 47% of the voters. But the Detail Debbies out there are always demanding more.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Marvel Comics announced today that Captain America will be elected President of the United States in an upcoming issue. Voters picked him after Wolverine was taped saying 47% of the X-Men are lazy bastards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Thank you very much. This has been a rough week for Mitt Romney. Oh, my God. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty has quit his co-chair of Mitt Romney's presidential team. He quit. I believe the technical term is abandoning ship. I think that's the technical term. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, today, I saw a guy scraping a Romney bumper sticker off his car. It was Paul Ryan. That's not good.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Disgraced Missouri Senate Candidate Todd Akin - remember the legitimate rape guy? Remember that guy? Well, this week, he came to Mitt Romney's defense over his latest gaffe. Well, that's got to help, huh? If Romney could just get John Edwards and OJ to speak for him - oh, my God. It would put him right over the top.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;All the political pundits have taken Romney to task for saying that his gaffe was not presidential. Vice-presidential, sure. That's Joe Biden territory right there.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Here is a huge turnaround. Chick-fil-A has a new slogan: 'Cluck Any One You Want.' That's their new slogan. They've pledged to stop contributing money to groups opposing gay marriage. In fact, Chick-fil-A now says if you don't want to marry a chick, that's your business. That is your business. That's fine. In fact, the head of Chick-fil-A said today he doesn't care what goes between two buns anymore.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, this has been a big story here in LA all day. The space shuttle Endeavour is going to retire right here in Los Angeles. And to make room for the shuttle journey on the streets - and because the shuttle is so wide, they had to cut down 400 trees to make room for it. The same thing they did a couple of weeks ago to get Chris Christie back to New Jersey.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, according to an article on MSNBC, they say the economy has finally bottomed out. We are now at the bottom. Well, there's a good campaign slogan for Obama, huh? 'It Can't Get Any Worse Than This.' We are at rock bottom. It's uphill from here. But, the economy is still bad. The economy is so bad, I saw a guy in Beverly Hills today with an iPhone 3. Okay, that's how bad - the economy is so bad, remember Romney's 47%? It's now 74%. That's how bad. That's how bad it is. The economy is so bad, for Halloween, a lot of kids this year can't afford costumes. They're just taking off all their clothes and going as members of the royal family.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Welcome to the late show, ladies and gentlemen, home of freeloaders and deadbeats. Well, let's see, the leaves are falling. Temperatures are falling. Romney's poll numbers are falling. It must be autumn.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;I'm so darned upset with this Mitt Romney. Now listen this. Like I'm telling you, first of all let me just say one thing. I wouldn't give this guy's trouble to a monkey on a rock. So here's what happened, a secret videotape and this took place in May. He's at a speaking engagement, I believe in Florida, I believe at a country club, I don't know that for sure but that's what I think it is and is being videotaped on a cell phone by a member of the wait staff or busboy or somebody who's working the room. And at the affair we hear him talking to his buddy millionaires about the thing that really gets on his nerves, is poor people. He says they just drive him nuts with being poor and being so needy.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Now upon closer examination of the videotape, he [Romney] goes into this whole thing about how he's been on my show, our show a few times, been on the Jay Leno show many more than a few times. And after that he said that 'Letterman hates me,' he said, 'because I've been on the Jay Leno show more than I've been on his show.' Well, that's absolutely - the man is delusional, honest, if he thinks I hate him. ? We are not in the hate business. We are here looking to make friends. Now Mitt Romney has been on the show many, many times. Let me ask you something, Mitt, if we hated you why do we keep begging you to be on the show? ? About a hundred, maybe 200 times - that's a lot of times. Let me go out on a limb here and say Mitt Romney or the little buddy Vice President, Who is the Vice President? His little buddy Gilligan. They have an open invitation any time on short notice. You want to be here tomorrow, fine. Come tomorrow. You want to be here Monday, any time, I don't care. Bring in Paul Ryan, bring in Mitt Romney, bring in Mrs. Mitt and all the kids, and bring in everybody. We don't hate you, Mitt. We don't hate people. And by the way, if this is based on being on the Leno show more than being on our show, does it make any sense that we would hate a man who has gone through that suffering?&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;The space shuttle is going to be driven through Los Angeles tomorrow. Isn't that nice? That's exciting! The bad news, it's going to be driven by Lindsay Lohan.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;CBS just announced that Mitt Romney and President Obama are both going to appear on '60 Minutes' this Sunday in separate interviews. Yeah, Romney's really excited about this because it will be one of the rare times he actually knows he's being recorded.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, I heard that Romney has also agreed to appear on 'The View.' His advisers think it's a good idea because since it's the one place where it's impossible for him to say anything.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Utah Senate candidate Scott Howell is telling voters that his opponent, 78-year-old Orrin Hatch, should not be elected because he could die in office. But today, Howell called Hatch himself just to say, 'Boo!'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;NASA says the Mars rover Curiosity will spend the next few days studying a piece of rock. Yeah, a few days looking at rock. Which means the rover has discovered at least one interesting thing - weed. 'You gotta see this rock, man. It's like, from Mars. Oh yeah, that's a rock.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Congress has unveiled its own search engine to help citizens find bills that are in the Senate and House. Yes, they say it's a great resource for people unfamiliar with the bills, like members of the Senate and House.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Finally, Marvel Comics announced that its hero, Captain America, will become President in the next issue. Yeah. That is, until someone releases the tape of him insulting 47% of the Justice League.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;We have a fine one tonight, our guest tonight; President Bill Clinton will be joining us. He is from what I am being told right now just wrapping up his piece at the Democratic Convention.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;The point is this election will come down to attracting Latinos who, once again, are doing a job Americans aren't willing to do, voting. So it is no surprise that the Democrats made San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro their convention keynote speaker while Republicans countered with Chris Christie who while not technically Hispanic is at least 50% nacho.&quot;</SPAN></P>

So what is he saying? If we want real change, we got to throw him out?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What does that mean? I don't even understand what that means. We've gone from 'Yes, We Can,' to 'I'm Sorry, No One Can.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Mitt Romney's campaign today released his 2 2011 tax returns. And they came directly from his accountant. In fact, you can still see the Swiss stamp on the envelope. And this guy - this guy is nothing if not a smart businessman. In fact, he's already written off his campaign as a total loss. Yeah, he's deducted the whole thing.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Democrats still wanted him to release all his tax returns for the last ten years. Romney says he can't do it. And he's got a good excuse. He says - he says his dog ate them. And that Obama ate the dog.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;President Obama's campaign is trying to appeal to single women in Florida over the age of 65. Which explains Obama's new slogan: Hope, Change and Boniva.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Mitt Romney just released a new campaign ad aimed at seniors, too. It's called, Least We Can Do. Named after how much he plans on doing for seniors. 'Is that the least we can do? Okay, good. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Wrap it up.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;It's been a rough week for Romney. I would not want to be in his shoes this week. It was found new documents show that Mitt Romney's campaign is $11 million in debt. Yeah. First Romney's advisers had to explain to him that he's running out of money, and then they had to explain what running out of money means.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Anyway, a new poll found that 75% of Americans. 75% of Americans feel little or no personal connection with Mitt Romney and it gets worse!

Ten million. And that's just here in LA.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I never thought we could talk about this woman again, but she's back in the news. Monica Lewinsky is writing a memoir about her affair with Bill Clinton. Well, not a moment too soon. Well, according to reports, she will reveal that he wanted to have a threesome. So despite being a Rhodes Scholar, despite being President of the United States, turns out he's just a regular guy like you and me.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;It's fall in New York City and today Mayor Bloomberg banned 16 ounce cups of chowder.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You know who's at the UN?

Let me make something clear to Madonna: Americans will not give in to threats.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, so far this year, eight elderly people in Central Florida have actually driven their cars into post offices. Apparently the drivers are hitting the gas pedal instead of the brake and crashing into the building. And postal officials are trying to prevent further incidents. They're now requesting everyone in the country stop sending letters to old people.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Interesting story in the paper today. It says a lot of female college students are now turning to sugar daddies to help pay their college tuition. You know, when Mitt Romney said borrow from your dad, I don't think this is what he had in mind.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;There was an odd moment there during 'The View.' Barbara Walters - they're interviewing the President and his wife - during the interview Barbara Walters raises her hand and told the President that she once slept with Truman. Yeah. And then Barbara asked to be excused. That was an odd moment, all right.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;So anyway, Mitt is out now riding on a bus. I think it's his first time on a bus. He's trying to show the world that he's a regular guy so he's taking a bus tour and it's just like the Willie Nelson bus except on the Romney bus the brownies are just brownies. That's the only difference.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Some election news, a new poll found that Mitt Romney is behind in Florida by 1%, which is weird. Because if there's one group that loves Romney it is definitely the 1%.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;I read that Clint Eastwood's new movie, 'Trouble with the Curve' opened in third place this weekend after making only $12 million. Of course, when he saw the movie theater had so many empty seats, Eastwood was like, 'Look at these crowds.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;There are reports that President Obama is getting ready to release about one-third of the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay - which gets even worse when you hear they are all going to work as replacement refs for the NFL.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;In an ordinary election involving a stagnant economy, global unrest, the typical incumbent President would be at an enormous disadvantage. Unless that incumbent President is running against the guy who just appeared to suggest that we don't need to have a healthcare plan for uninsured Americans because we have emergency rooms! And, like, they're open all night.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;You see whatever his missteps are as a candidate Barack Obama is surging in the polls because the closer we get to the election Mitt Romney appears to be getting dumber. ? It's like he's Charlie from 'Flowers for Algernon' and the serum is wearing off.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Mitt Romney has identified a new frontier! Just as Kennedy challenged us to put a man on the moon ? Mitt Romney is now challenging us to add power windows to the Delta shuttle! Not because it is easy but because it is impossible! Now, folks, the 'Air Pressure Patrol' out there is going to say that rolling down the window will cause all the passengers to get sucked out. Wrong! Obviously he will put screens on the windows.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Conservatives, just forget about the polls! It is way too soon to start mourning the death of the Romney campaign. And I am not in denial here, because that would mean I was starting the five stages of grief. And I am not! Oh, that makes me so angry! And I will do anything not to be going through the five stages! Let's make a deal, God. I'm so sad. Well, nothing more I can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, as you know, the NFL is getting a lot of complaints about these replacement refs. In fact, it's gotten so bad, they're now thinking about getting replacement refs to replace the replacement refs. ?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are you mad about this? A lot of people very upset. Yeah, well, the public is outraged. They're not used to seeing this level of incompetence outside of Congress.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;It turns out that replacement refs who made the botched call the other night is the vice president at a branch of B of A. He is a replacement ref and he works at Bank of America. Do you know what that means? He screwed us twice.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;President Obama now getting support from elderly voters. This week, he got endorsed by Madonna.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the most recent polls show that President Obama may have as much as a five-point lead over Mitt Romney. In fact, the President is feeling so confident, he is thinking about letting Joe Biden start speaking again.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And 'Forbes' magazine has come out with its annual list of the 400 richest Americans. To show you how bad the economy is, 200 of them have moved back in with their parents.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, according to a recent article, Americans consume more cocaine than any other country in the world. It was nice to know we're number one in something, isn't it?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;This weekend a ten-mile section of the 405 freeway, the busiest freeway in the world, will be shut down. And to ease congestion, they're asking undocumented immigrants to sneak into the country through Arizona. It's just for this weekend only. We're sorry about the inconvenience.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Are you excited about the presidential election or are you just fed up and sick? What are you fed up and sick or excited? Listen to this, Mitt Romney, a week ago they were ready to count the guy out now he's bounced back and on a bus tour of Ohio; he spent the entire day on the bus and he's been working very hard kissing babies and freeloaders.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You know who's pumped up for this debate is Barack Obama. Because he hasn't had to debate anybody in four years so he is ready to go and earlier today the White House released a press statement saying that they were calling the upcoming debate the 'Thrilla with Vanilla.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent concert, Madonna told the audience she'd strip naked if President Obama is elected. In a related story, President Obama is trailing in the polls by 97%.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's an election update. Mitt Romney's campaign said that President Obama is spiking the ball too early in Ohio, after recent polls showed Obama pulling ahead. Yeah. Obama hasn't earned that win yet, which is why today the NFL replacement refs just gave it to him anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I love how the politicians capitalize on this kind of thing. Like, the minute the replacement refs were fired, President Obama said, 'See, sometimes losing jobs can be a good thing.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, a new survey out today shows how much time we waste everyday in our lives. For example, we waste seven minutes in line every time we go to get coffee, 28 minutes getting through airport security. Four years waiting for Obama to do something about the economy.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Madonna has come out in support of President Obama. Well, sure. She doesn't want Paul Ryan touching her Medicare.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Paul Ryan now says that President Obama's foreign policy has blown up in his face and it's time go back to the Republican foreign policy. Let's see. Obama's kept Guantanamo Bay open. The troops are still overseas. The Mideast still hates us. That is the Republicans. Isn't that the Republican policy?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, according to a new poll, New Jersey voters actually support a proposed law that would require dog owners to put their animals in a safety restraint or a crate in the car. You have to have your dog in the car with a seat belt on. More bad news for Mitt Romney.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;In a new interview, Ralph Nader called both President Obama and President Bush 'war criminals.' Can you believe that? Ralph Nader is still alive? Really?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and authorities at JFK Airport arrested two women who were smuggling something like two pounds of cocaine in their giant hair weave. Talk about crack heads.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's a campaign update. During a speech yesterday, President Obama accidentally said he wants to export more jobs. Then he corrected himself and said he meant to say products. And then he corrected himself to say, 'Oh, who gives a crap? I'm still going to win.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;I actually read about a man who actually went to high school with Mitt Romney and then later went to law school with President Obama. When asked how going to school with two presidential candidates makes him feel the guy was like, 'Bad about my job at Arby's.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Get this; New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that those drivers who get five DUIs will now have their license revoked. So now New York drivers can rest safe knowing that everyone else on the road only has a maximum of four DUIs.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;So folks, nation, with this Election Day looming every one is trying to read the tea leaves. Except Romney who as a Mormon is allowed only to read the caffeine-free Diet Coke. But that's not looking good either because Obama currently leads Romney by 10 points in Ohio, 9 points in Florida and 12 points in Pennsylvania which wouldn't be a problem if between now and November 6th we can just get 290 million people to move to Arkansas. Arkansas, come for the meth, stay because you traded your car for meth.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;It's still early, there are 40 days left until the election. A lot can happen in 40 days. Obama could make a gaffe. Mitt could win the debates. God could send a flood to destroy all mankind. So there's hope.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Conservative blogger Dean Chambers, who analyzed these polls favoring Obama and then reached the scientific conclusion that they just didn't look right. So Chambers set up his own polling site Unskewedpolls.com where he unskewed all the national polls by skewing them in favor of Romney, and surprisingly found that Mitt actually had a nearly 8 point lead. That doesn't even count the margin of error. And given how many errors Romney's made, I think he should get all of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, as Mitt Romney calls that, 'Healthcare the way God intended.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;According to a photo sent back from the Mars rover - did you hear about this? They now believe there was once a large stream of flowing water on the surface of Mars, thousands of years ago. Actually a river going through Mars. But now it's completely dried up. Today, Al Gore blamed it on Martian warming.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, been on our show many times. He said in the paper today he once tried a pot brownie and it made him sleepy. Have you seen Barney Frank? Does he look like he ever had just one brownie?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Another kind of blow to the Romney campaign. Earlier today, the empty chair endorsed Obama.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Mitt Romney is doing what he can. He's trying very hard. He wants to unite America, wants to unite America, the rich with the wealthy, the poor with the indigent, and the white with the Caucasians.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;The debates, the presidential debates begin on Wednesday. Romney has taken two days off to-- you have to prepare. You can't just walk in there. You have to prepare for these debates. So Romney is taking a couple of days off. He's going to study up. They're going to have practice debates. They're going to do that for two days, and another full day of spray tanning, and he'll be ready to go.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Thirty-nine days until the presidential election and we could have a new President in 39 days. Well, the current President, President Obama, was on the show last week. The challenger, Mitt Romney, has not been on the show. We have asked him to be on the show, any night, any time, short notice, whatever he wants. He can be on the show. He's got 39 days. Now, I don't want to persuade anybody unnecessarily, but if he's not here in 39 days, don't vote for him.&quot; David Letterman: Top Ten Reasons Mitt Romney Should Appear On 'The Late Show' 10. It's required by the Constitution 9. Compared to me, anybody looks popular 8. Plenty of parking for the Cadillacs 7. If he makes a gaffe, no one will see it 6. Green room stocked with plain yogurt and tap water 5. None of our cameras are hidden 4. He can fire as many 'Late Show' staffers as he wants 3. It's a chance to win back the lazy freeloader vote 2. Rick Santorum will do this show, but Mitt won't 1. John McCain once blew us off ? how'd that turn out? Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Here's what people are talking about, you guys. With the first presidential debate less than a week away, both the Obama camp and Romney camp are being careful not to overhype their candidates. They're asking voters to lower their expectations and not get too excited. Or as voters put it, 'Way ahead of you. Way ahead of you, buddy.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;. A new report found that taxpayers spent $1 billion supporting the Obama family last year. Yeah, when Mitt Romney heard that, he was shocked. He was like, 'You guys were living off only a billion dollars?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Florida election officials now say that at least ten counties have identified suspicious and possibly fraudulent voter registration forms.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House confirmed today that, yes, Chinese hackers over the weekend infiltrated government computers. Chinese hackers broke into our computers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ever since we've been on the air we've had the candidates for election as the guests on this show. And sometimes they win, sometimes they don't win but they've always been here. ? So a couple of weeks ago we had President Obama who was on the show. He's running for the office. Thirty-three days till election, 36, 36 days till election. We have not heard from Mitt Romney and his people. They have an open invitation to be here. Thirty-six days remaining. He's going to have to-- if you want to be in the White House you got to sit right over there and talk to me. I'm sorry. That's the way it goes. So Mitt is on record as saying when he gets to be President the first thing he will do is he will talk to China. He will put China in their place. Really? What about that? What about over here, Mitt? He can handle China but he can't handle me? By the way, I don't care. I think it would be great to have Mitt on the show, open invitation. ? But I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm a registered Independent. You just got to come on. You just-- and listen, do me a favor, if he doesn't come on, don't vote for him. It's just that simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fun fact for you. Mitt Romney has been preparing for the debate by debating a Republican Senator who is playing the part of President Obama. Yeah. Meanwhile President Obama has been preparing for Romney by debating an ATM machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Millions of Americans are still looking for work, particularly low-skilled workers with no high school diplomas who face a 12% unemployment rate. Now my heart goes out to those blue collar workers. All they know how to do is make stuff while we white collar workers have the education necessary to check our e-mail. The problem is, America has lost its good manufacturing jobs to places of cheap unregulated labor like China, Vietnam, and the gulag beneath Disney World.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow night, the big presidential debate in Denver, Colorado. How many are going to watch the debates? How many wish it was like the NFL, you can just bring in replacement candidates, wouldn't that be great? I understand they're gonna have fact checkers standing by in case either candidate happens to say something factual.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Romney camp said that Mitt is preparing for the debate. And he has a number of zingers ready for President Obama. A number of zingers. And if the zingers don't work, they have a squirting flower - Maybe a hand buzzer, whoopie cushion.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;At a campaign rally in Charlotte, Vice President Joe Biden said, 'The middle class has been buried the past four years.' They're buried. I'm sorry, which candidate is he campaigning for? I'm confused.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore - listen to this, Al Gore is gonna be covering the debates for his network, Current TV. So Al Gore on Current TV talking about Mitt Romney. That is like the perfect storm of boring, okay? It reaches Zen levels.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well this is kind of scary. Washington has confirmed that Chinese hackers have hacked into US government computer systems and US security experts aren't sure how they did it. You know, I'm no computer expert. Maybe the fact that all our computers are made in China! Hello? You think that has something to do with it?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;It's less than 32 days or something before the election and Mitt Romney has not been on the show. We have asked Mitt Romney 100 times. We ask him daily. We call. We call his wife. We call the kids. We'll take his lovely wife. We'll take Mitt. We'll take them all but they don't they don't return our calls. If you're worried about coming here, is that the guy you want in the Oval Office, really? If you're worried about ? 'I'm afraid Dave will say something about my hair gel.' So it comes down to this, ladies and gentlemen, just do me a favor. And you don't owe me anything, by God. I'm here to entertain. I'm here to lighten your load. I'm here to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. But here if you can do me one favor, unless Mitty comes to be on the show-- and we would love to have him, don't mistake this, we would love to have Mitt sit right over there-- but if he doesn't, don't vote for him. It's just that easy.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Anyway, the debates begin tomorrow night and we'll see Mitt and Ann Romney. Of course, you remember them as the stars of 'Dynasty.'&quot; David Letterman: &quot;I love the presidential debates. ? At my house what we do before the debates, each night before they begin we put out a plate of milk and cookies for Jim Lehrer.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Oh, these debates will be the last - think about it. They will be the last debates until the 2016 campaign begins. So these are the last debates until the beginning of the 2016 campaign which is in February.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Candidates preparing hard for the presidential debate. President Obama's advisors have been working with him to keep his responses short. Yeah. In fact, the only words the President plans on saying are 'bin Laden' and 'dead.' That's it.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;The lead singer of the 1990's band Creed has said he thinks President Obama is ineffective. Yeah. In other words, President Obama lost the support of yet another unemployed person.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Joe Biden campaigning very hard for Obama. In Florida Vice President Joe Biden told a group of nurses, if there are any angels in heaven, they're all nurses. Then Biden said, of course, maybe they wouldn't be in heaven if they'd had better nurses. That's where he lost the crowd.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;The first debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is tomorrow night, and the campaigns are doing whatever they can to get ready. Actually, I heard that the Obama campaign is a little worried, 'cause during his flight to Nevada on Sunday, the President apparently watched four hours of football instead of studying. Although it did mark the first time all year Obama's actually seen something get passed.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Everyone's looking for some kind of sign as to who will win debate. In fact, one group of researchers say that presidential candidates who blink less during a debate are more likely to win the election. Or as Michele Bachmann put it, 'Any way I can get back in this thing or what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Because Rick Santorum is in town, by the way, just for today only, the hookers in Time Square are only selling cookies.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Firs debate tonight, domestic policy. And if you can only watch one, I think this would be the one. Domestic policy. This is going to answer all our questions about all our problems. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believe me, we've all got a lot of money coming back. Don't worry about that.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Number two, foreign policy. How do we get along with other countries like China, like Canada, like Mexico, like NATO, the NATO countries, like the Benelux countries, on and on an on. Like Australia. How do we get along with Rapa Nui.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;The third debate the candidates will be bidding on abandoned storage lockers.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well the presidential debates were earlier tonight and I think most the nation's all thinking the same thing, just one more day 'til Thursday Night Football.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;You know, watching the debates is a lot like football, particularly the New York Jets. I mean, Tebow is like Romney ? almost surely disappointing if he gets in. And Obama's like Sanchez, already in there and disappointing us right now. So it's hard.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;There's been a lot of talk this year about voter fraud, election fraud. But we haven't seen many case of it. You know what I think we should be investigating? Candidate fraud. Can we look at candidate fraud, please? Are these the only two choices we have?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, you know what's interesting? Unlike those Republican primary debates, there was no cheering or applause allowed from the audience tonight in Denver. They could not cheer or applaud, which was fairly easy to control. See, they filled the crowd with Colorado Rockies fans. They're not used to cheering or applauding. So it made it easier.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;We didn't get a chance to see the debate tonight, obviously, because we tape earlier or at the same time as the debate. I don't know how it turned out, but President Obama had a tough job. I mean, he had to defend his record and attack Mitt Romney's record, which is difficult, since Obama's record as President was once Mitt Romney's record as governor.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Oh and more bad news for Mitt Romney, the latest polls show that 70% of dyslexics plan to vote for 'Amabo.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently there's some member of Congress has had their office burglarized on Capitol Hill. Thieves are robbing congressmen. What happened to professional courtesy? Where did that go?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well here in California, Governor Brown signed a law allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's license. And next week he promised to sign another bill allowing them to get phony proof of insurance. So that'll be good. You need both bills to work.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And the Los Angeles City Council has voted to repeal the ban on medical marijuana dispensaries it approved just a few months ago. They are not closing down the pot dispensaries, as we call them, high schools. But they're not closing them down. They will remain open.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Tonight was the first presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Not only that, it was also the Obamas' 20th wedding anniversary. Little weird during the debate when Obama promised to balance the budget, lower taxes and be home by 10:00 for cuddle time.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;More election news, while campaigning yesterday in Colorado, Mitt Romney made a stop at the fast food restaurant Chipotle. The guy behind the counter was like 'burrito?' And Romney was like, 'Hey there burrito, my name is Mitt Romney. Pleasure to meet you.' Honest mistake.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Listen to this you guys. NASA is warning that solar radiation could cause TV outages over the next week or as Mitt Romney put it, 'Please happen during the debate. Please happen during the debate. Please.'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;The candidate decided who would get to speak first tonight via a coin toss, which was confusing for Mitt Romney. They had to explain what a coin was.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;And it also happens to be the Obamas' 20th wedding anniversary. That seems very convenient. 'Honey, I'd love to go to the ballet with you, but I'm debating Mitt Romney that night. Hey Mitt, help me out, will you?'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;According to 'The New York Times,' team Romney has been working on what they call zingers for Mitt to use tonight. Just an FYI, If you call it a zinger, probably isn't one.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;In preparation of tonight's debate, Mitt Romney has reportedly been practicing his zingers. He's practicing zingers. Romney said he couldn't wait to use his best zinger, your mamma is so poor, she only makes $250,000 a year.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today was not only the first presidential debate, it was also President Obama's 20th wedding anniversary. I think the President got a little confused. At one point, he told Michelle that she was out of touch with the middle class and Romney that he looks as beautiful as the day they first met.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Obama is winning the election according to an informal poll conducted by 7-Eleven. It's true. However the findings are being hotly contests by analysts from the Cheesecake Factory. More on that later.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;A recent survey says that many women over the age of 65 think that Joe Biden is sexy. So now when your grandma asks for a hot cup of Joe, she might not be asking for coffee.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Everyone is talking about the presidential debate earlier tonight in Denver. I watched it. Wow. My goodness! No, I watched it. It was in Denver. I liked the part when Mitt Romney was like, 'Yay! Tax cuts.' and Obama was like, 'Boo, rich people.' And Bill Clinton was like, 'which one of y'all needs a wingman for after the debate?'&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Personally, I think this debate was an instant classic. People are already calling it 'The Full Throttle in Colorado.' 'The Talky in the Rockies.' 'The Oooo That Stings Near Colorado Springs.'&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Now the host of the debate tonight was Jim Lehrer. It has an H in there. Who does he think he is, smug bastard? He's that dude from PBS. For some reason they chose him over Elmo. I think Elmo would have been better.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Anyway, some people complain that debate moderators always ask 'gotcha' questions. But I don't think they are gotcha enough. They should lull the candidates into a false sense of security, then pounce. Like, 'Mr. Romney, you say you support tax cuts for the middle class. Team Edward or Team Jacob? Answer the question.'&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Tonight was the first of three presidential debates. Tonight's was on domestic policy. The next one is on foreign policy. The last one is I think what's the best Van Halen album? To me, presidential debates are like marriage. If you screw up the first one, they give you two more to get it right.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Anyway, I can't believe we're only a month away from the end of the campaign. Seems like it just started ? three years ago.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Not that either man was perfect tonight. It was a little awkward when Romney made everyone promise the debate wasn't being secretly taped. And Obama looked a little confused because none of the domestic policy questions were about Kenya.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Did you know Mitt Romney was one of the original Baja Men? Not the band. He just keeps his money in Baja.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, in here, out there, across America, you know why people are excited because it is a huge night. The first presidential debate just happened in Denver. Now, I haven't seen it yet so don't tell me what happens. If anything happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Not such a great debate last night, huh? What did you think? A lot of people very disappointed about that debate. A lot of people disappointed in President Obama's performance last night. Last night critics say president Obama spent too much time looking down at something on the podium. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you notice that? Yeah. And today the President apologized and said at the next debate, no more Angry Birds.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;At one point last night, President Obama said the one thing about being president is learning to say no. Yeah. Especially when someone asks, do you feel ready for this debate?&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Mitt Romney went after PBS last night. About time someone went after those guys. It's about time someone took some starch out of their collars. I'll get you, 'Reading Rainbow.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;During last night's debate, Mitt Romney said he would cut funds to PBS even though he loves Big Bird. Yeah. He said he's definitely against whatever the hell Bert and Ernie are up to. It goes against God!&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;There was a coin toss to see which candidate would speak first. There was an awkward moment just before the coin toss when Romney asked, what's that shiny little disk you're holding?&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Its was one point during the debate Mitt Romney said, if you're over 60 you can stop listening now. Yeah. To which moderator said, then I should have stopped listening 40 years ago.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You know that Mitt Romney, say what you will be Mitt Romney, last night I thought he was energetic, he was crisp, he was dynamic. What you have done with the real Mitt Romney! Where, where is he? What happened?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;I don't know if you know this, we have been trying for months and months and months to get Mitt Romney on the show. And they won't return our calls. It's like we don't exist. And we kept begging them, short notice, any night. Mitt you can come, your family can come they can be with you on the show, they can wait in the car, you can in the car, the family can be on the show. We are begging Mitt Romney, and now he did so well last night and he's so cocky, I'm afraid he might actually show up.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;How about that Jim Lehrer, I mean, what a rough night what a rough day. He had trouble getting through the Denver airport with those bags under his eyes. And reminded me of one of those replacement referees, you know what I'm saying. It won't happen again. Next year they're bringing back Billy Crystal, don't worry. Billy crystal will be back.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;And of course the next debate will be the vice presidential debate. Following that will be First Lady debate. And finally, the kid's debate.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;It's interesting. Mitt Romney, wow powerful. Not afraid of anything. Said he's going to get rid of Big Bird. Going to slash PBS. He has the guts, standing in front of Jim Lehrer, who has made a career being on PBS. He says and then he mentions Big Bird and then later, Mitt Romney, they mention Donald Trump. Donald trump who endorses Mitt Romney. It is interesting. One, comical TV character with a synthetic yellow hair and then you have Big Bird.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You can't win moderating a presidential debate, think about it. You can't win that. I mean they don't even you want threw. And Jim Lehrer, and it seemed like we have the same thing after every time Jim Lehrer moderates?everybody says what happened? He lost control. What I'm trying to say is Jim Lehrer, I wouldn't give his troubles to a monkey on a rock.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Everybody is saying today what was wrong? What happened? He was off his game. Where did he go? Why didn't he challenge? He wasn't ready, ill-prepared. Not out there. No tiger in the eye. And Mitt, God, you know, if I didn't know better you would think he was full of coffee.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;So now President Obama excuses. I called some folks at the White House and they said all right, here's ten reasons:&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. &quot;I haven't slept an hour since 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. &quot;Romney's Hair is mesmerizing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. &quot;Didn't want to wake Jim Lehrer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. &quot;I haven't been the same since I quit smoking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. &quot;Honestly I though the debate was next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. &quot;I live with my mother-in-law. What do you want from me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &quot;Kept blanking on what percentage of the country Mitt's written off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. &quot;Skipped rehearsal, just like Letterman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;Why don't you ask bin Laden how I did?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;It's Bush's fault.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, my gosh. Well, the consensus is Mitt Romney won the presidential debate last night. The only people that thought Obama won, the replacement refs. Those are the only ones.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;They're saying close to 60 million people may have watched the debate. In fact, the only person who didn't tune in, I think, was President Obama. What happened?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;How about the moderator? PBS's Jim Lehrer. How about him? He looked so life like, didn't he? Oh, my God. Those holograms are unbelievable. I mean, the way he moved. It looked like he was actually there.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And President Obama talked last night about finding other sources of energy for the future. Other sources of energy? He couldn't muster enough energy for the 90 minute debate.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Last night was his anniversary. Let me tell you something. The only way his wedding anniversary could have been worse was if he had forgotten it. Okay, really.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Now, First Lady Michelle ? I think she was depressed, too. In fact, right after the debate, she got a quart of Haagen Dazs, two corndogs and a 32 ounce Big Gulp.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;After months of build-up, last night was the first presidential debate at the University of Denver. Of course, a lot of big names didn't show up for the event. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, President Obama?&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;It was not a good night. Not a good night for the President. In fact, the President seemed to give long-winded, disjointed answers during last night's debate. Even Gary Busey was like, 'Dude, you got to focus.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Jim Lehrer had trouble making sure the candidates stick to the rules last night. Even NFL replacement refs were like, 'This guy's a disaster!'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;Most people agree, most analysts of this sort of thing, that Mitt Romney won the debate last night which means President Obama lost two fights on his anniversary last night.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;The President seemed a little bit out of it last night. He had all the enthusiasm of a husband talking to his wife's friends at a dinner party. Kept looking down and frowning. It was like he was looking ? he was trying to find a B of A on Apple Maps or something.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;The only thing that could have salvaged his performance last night is if the body of bin Laden fell from the ceiling onto the stage.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;The moderator for the debate last night was Jim Lehrer of PBS and Jim was as in control of this evening as a replacement referee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama is back on the campaign trail. President Obama's telling people that wasn't the real Mitt Romney who showed up at the debate. Let me tell you something, whoever it was, Obama had better hope he doesn't show up again or he's going to get his ass kicked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney really on the offensive the other night. Time after time he made statements that I think damaged President Obama's credibility. It's almost like he was Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Romney was in such a good mood after the debate, on the way home he let the dog ride inside the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Democrats are now accusing Mitt Romney of cheating. They claimed he used a cheat sheet at the debate. You know, you're not allowed to have any notes. They said he had a cheat sheet. First they accused Romney of lying during the debate now lying and cheating. Maybe he is the guy to work with Congress. Maybe they would have something in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twitter said today that Wednesday night's debate was the most tweeted event in political history. Really, in history? You think it has more to do with the fact that Twitter is only six years old? A lot of people tweeting during the Lincoln/Douglas debates, really? Was a lot going on there? Kennedy/Nixon?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Columbus came here looking for the easiest way to obtain cheap Asian goods. So he came to the right place. Just came too early. That's all. Now we just go right to Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New research shows that drinking coffee could lead to an increased risk of glaucoma. So to be on the safe side, if you're going to drink a lot of coffee, smoke a lot of weed, too, to balance it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, gas prices jumped this week. It's almost six bucks a gallon for premium in certain part of California. Six bucks a gallon. In fact, gas is so expensive; coming in today I saw a car in the car pool lane with more than one person in it. That shows you how high it's getting. So unemployment is down and gas is up. Great. We can finally get jobs, now we can't afford to drive to work. So you're pretty much screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the debate? The first debate. You folks see the first debate? I'm telling you, this is good because it brings the country together, not just the country, the whole world was watching this thing, like 60 million people viewed the first debate around the world. Clint Eastwood watched in Hollywood, alone with an empty chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt did a great job. Don't you think Mitt the other night did a great job? Very excited after the debate, Mitt celebrated with a bottle of caffeine-free diet soda. I want to say something to Mitt now. Mitt, you're going to get the numbers - remember, though, if your poll numbers increase and stay up for more than four hours, call your doctor. Honest to God. I am begging you, call your doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After months of intense debate practice with Senator John Kerry, President Obama promises to be more aggressive and a lot tougher on Mitt Romney in the next debate. Which explains Obama's new debate coach, Nicki Minaj.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news. In a new interview, Mitt Romney said that he is against marijuana being used for recreational purposes. When stoners heard that, they were like, 'Well, what about just for fun? Can we use it for fun?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, First Lady Michelle Obama said that she would choose Will Smith or Denzel Washington to play her husband in a movie. Or as Democrats put that, 'Any way they can play him in a debate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do I look a little thinner? I'm on that new Exxon Mobile diet. You spend so much money on gas, you can't afford to eat. That's basically what happens.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Columbus is credited with discovering America. But, you know, Columbus also declared America for Spain. Which is why, of course, we all speak Spanish today.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the Obamas celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary Saturday night in Washington. Yeah, they celebrated at a restaurant called Bourbon Steak. That was the name of the restaurant they went to. Bourbon Steak. I understand Michelle had the steak to celebrate the occasion. And the President had bourbon to help forget the debate.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Now, it's getting catty. Democrats are accusing Mitt Romney of cheating during the debate. They said he cheated. You know, I don't know who he cheated off of. I think you can rule out President Obama, okay? He didn't have any answers worth stealing, did he?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, now, Al Gore has come to the defense of President Obama, saying his poor performance in the debate was due to Denver's thin air. That's what Al Gore said. Today, the baseball team, the Colorado Rockies, said, 'Yeah, that's what happened to us, too!'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the average American's net worth has gone down in the last four years. The net worth of the average member of Congress has actually gone up. No wonder Congress isn't motivated to do anything. They're the only ones better off now than they were four years ago.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, good news for the White House. Unemployment has now dropped under 8%. Although those numbers could go up again when Mitt Romney fires everybody at PBS. It's 7.8%. It's the lowest it's been since Obama took office. The Obama campaign said they can't wait to take these statistics and not use them in the next debate.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;A marijuana farm the size of two football fields was just discovered in Chicago. The size of two football fields. They found it right behind a Pizza Hut that was the size of three football fields. Imagine that. A marijuana farm the size of two football fields in Chicago. You know, I don't think this is what Michelle Obama had in mind when she said people should do more urban gardening.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;It's Nobel Prize season. Are you aware they're passing out the Nobel Prize? Earlier today, a medical team received a Nobel Prize for reviving the Mitt Romney campaign. They brought it back to life. They gave them the Nobel Prize.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Thursday, I don't care what are you doing but cancel it. Thursday is the Vice Presidential Debate. ? You people are thinking big stinking deal; you people are thinking who cares? Well, I'll tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, one of these people, one of these two guys in the future will be representing the United States at the funerals for world leaders.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;The Vice Presidential Debate is different. It's a little bit different. The format is completely different. The Vice Presidential Debate, they spend 90 minutes guessing the actual retail price of merchandise.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Apparently, after last week's debate, polls show Obama trailing Mitt Romney by one point. Yeah, one point. Or as it's also known, the thing Obama failed to make during last week's debate.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Last night, President Obama actually joked about his debate performance by saying that he can't perform flawlessly night after night. Some people are saying he stole that line from a Viagra commercial.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Speaking of the election, you guys, the Vice Presidential Debate is just three days away. Both sides are busy getting ready. And Republican candidate Paul Ryan said that he expects Joe Biden to come at him like a cannonball. Biden was, like, 'There's going to be a pool there?'&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Nation, I am still glowing from last week's runaway debate victory for Mitt Romney. He's got the mitt-mentum. The mo-mitt-num. The rom-nentum. There's still no word for it, it's never existed before.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Now folks we all know the Bureau of Labor Statistics are cooking the books for their buddy Obama. Of course they vow there's no conspiracy claiming before the number is ever released there is 'An eight day security lockdown during which confidentiality agreements are signed each morning and computers are encrypted and data locked into a safe every time one of the analysts goes even to the bathroom.' But that doesn't mean they're releasing all the numbers. When those analyst goes to the bathroom is it number one or number two? America needs to know! And folks, this thing is too big for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to have done it all alone. It has to go all the way up to the bottom. Think about it. Last month 114,000 unemployed moochers, the President's natural allies, suddenly yank the government teat out of their mouths; get off the couch for 40 hours a week. Why? I say follow the money because I found out that right around the time those people got those jobs, they started getting paid. And just where does that money come from? Right out of the pockets of the job creators. How's that for your socialist redistribution of wealth? Folks, it's called class warfare, and the President loves it.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;President Obama was here in Los Angeles last night. He was here with his agent taking meetings in case it doesn't work out next month. Never can be too careful. The President was here for a fundraiser. A concert with Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Jennifer Hudson, Jon Bon Jovi and a special appearance by George Clooney. If Obama goes more than a month without seeing George Clooney he gets nervous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scientists in England report that thanks to evolution, by the year 3000, we will have smaller brains and even smaller testicles. You know what that means? We will all evolve into members of Congress. That is frightening.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Can you believe it's only another month until we start arguing on whether the election was stolen or not? It's hard to believe.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, a woman who claimed to be 132 years old has died. You know how she died? Skateboard accident. I was stunned by this. No, no. No, this is true. The woman claimed to be 132, but there's no way to verify the claim on account of her birth records are lost and John McCain doesn't remember meeting her. So there's really no way to back up any of this information.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;The format for the vice presidential debate is a little different. It will be the same kind of thing. But they runaround in the auditorium, Joe Biden and Rex Ryan, - Paul Ryan. They run around - Gilligan, whatever his name is. They run around the auditorium dressed as concession snacks.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;A couple of weeks ago we had the President, President Barack Obama, on this show. We have a standing invitation to all candidates. Anybody running for any office, really, we've invited them to be on this show over and over and over and over. And some people have referred to me-- and I'm too modest to say it myself-- but some people have invoked the phrase 'king maker.' Now I don't know that - So now here's the problem. We have asked politely over - and this has been going on not just the last couple of weeks, this has been going on for years two maybe years, since the campaign started. We invited all the Republican candidates to come be on the show, some did; some did not. Well, now that we have the one Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, we would like to get the guy on the show to chat with him. ? We call everyday, sometimes twice a day. 'Mitt, please come on, the President was on. Please, Mitt, you've got to come on.' Because Mitt's all about 'You know I'm going to fix the economy, take care of the world situation, I'm going to take on China. Job one, I'm going to put China in their place,' but yet he won't come and chat with me for 12 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, you tell me, what is wrong with that picture. What is wrong with that picture?&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Mitt Romney was out on the campaign trail yesterday and while visiting a grade school, Romney told students that fourth grade was his favorite. And then he said, 'Unless you're in another grade, then that was my favorite.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Speaking of Romney, people close to the campaign are saying that Mitt Romney's son, Tagg, is now one of his chief advisers. Yeah, when Mitt asked him to join his team, he put his arm on his son's shoulders and said, 'Tagg, you're it.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Yesterday, Donald Trump announced that he will be live tweeting during the next presidential debate. Then Obama was like, 'Me too.'&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;With just four weeks to go to Election Day the insurmountable, un-blowable lead that President Barack Obama enjoyed post-convention has been mounted and blown by Mitt Romney. No? I stand by that phrase. It is now Mitt Romney who cannot be mounted or blown. There's got to be a better way of saying this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it has been 16 months since Mitt Romney declared his candidacy-- a month since he accepted the nomination and five days since he started running for President. Folks, he is surging! New polls have him tied with or leading the President and the 'New York Times' 'Five Thirty Eight' blog now gives him a 28.6% chance of winning! He is on a rocket ride to plausible!&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;And, of course, in the face of this surge, Obama has become desperate. Yesterday at a California fund fund-raiser he warned the audience what it's gonna take to win saying 'We're only going to do it if everybody is almost obsessive for the next 29 days.' That's right, Obama supporters, right now you're only logged on to his website, Facebook page, Twitter feed, YouTube channel, mobile app, Pinterest board, tumblr, flickr, spotify, Storify and Instagram. He needs you to commit!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, tomorrow night, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan will be facing off in the Vice Presidential Debate. Well, actually the White House is a little worried, you know. In fact, Biden's handlers are telling him 'Whatever you do, don't be yourself.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Some Republicans are upset because back in 1991, Barack Obama was a guest at the wedding of tomorrow night's Vice Presidential Debate moderator, a woman named Martha Raddatz. Although to be fair, a few days before the last Presidential Debate, Mitt Romney attended Jim Lehrer's funeral.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the newest polls, President Obama has lost his lead and is now tied with Mitt Romney. And political experts say they haven't seen a slump in October this bad since Alex Rodriguez, I guess.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, even though Romney is doing better in the polls, they say he still has a gender problem. Well, not as bad a gender problem as Bruce Jenner, but still a gender problem.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;But the good news for the White House is unemployment has dropped to 7.8%, right where it was when President Obama took office. So Obama's gone from 'Change You Can Believe In' to 'Can You Believe There's No Change?'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the Secret Service caught a woman trying to sneak into the White House with a mysterious package. Turns out it was just Ann Romney with some carpet samples.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Mitt Romney is refusing to participate in the long-running special on Nickelodeon. You know 'Kids Pick the President?' He doesn't want to do it. Romney says it's nothing personal. He says that these kids are part of that 47% who contribute nothing to the country and mooch off their parents and grandparents.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Did you folks see the debate last week? And the guy I feel bad for in all of this - Romney will be fine, and the President will be fine. I feel bad for Jim Lehrer. First of all, you know he had trouble get through airport security with those bag under his eyes. They're saying that he lost control of the show, and I said, 'Hey, welcome to the club.'&quot; David Letterman: &quot;The Vice Presidential Debate is tomorrow night. It's going to be Joe Biden, Vice President Joe Biden, and Paul Ryan. They're debating. And they're both going to try to appeal to the working class. And I laugh. I enjoyed that. I said, 'America still has a working class?' I don't think so.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;But Democrats took kind of a pounding at the last debate, so now they're going to be a little more aggressive. Joe Biden is thinking of opening with a head butt.&quot; David Letterman: Top Ten Things Kids Would Like To Ask Mitt Romney: 10. Do you have a bazillion dollars or a gazillion dollars? 9. Where have you hidden Paul Ryan? 8. What part of the campaign have you pretended to like most? 7. If elected, will you please overturn healthy school lunches? 6. What's your favorite animal to strap on the roof of your car? 5. Why single out PBS for cuts when it's only 0.017% of our $4 trillion Federal budget? 4. Should I keep my allowance money in the Cayman Islands? 3. What's your position on Angry Birds? 2. If you become President, will we all get dancing horses? 1. Can I refuse to release my report card? Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Mitt Romney continues making campaign stops across the country this week, including one in Iowa where he outlined a new plan to help America's farmers. Of course the farmers were like, 'No thanks; we already have enough horse [bleep] to deal with.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;This is nice. The Obama's dog Bo turned four years old. Yeah. He spent the day as he always does digging holes, chasing squirrels and coaching Obama for the debate.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Speaking of Obama - I read that his campaign is planning to open up its 120th field office in Ohio. Yep. Even Starbucks was like, 'That's too many locations, man.'&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Folks, election watchers are always poised this late in the campaign season for what they refer to as an October surprise. It appears that time is upon us. As evidenced by the recent presidential debate where Barack Obama unveiled his explosive October surprise that he has given up. Surprise!&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Folks, isn't this a great campaign? Everything's coming up Romney. The latest polls have Romney neck and neck with Obama. Folks, this race is as tight as Mitt's smile when he meets a poor person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, although we're taping before it's over, there was a lot of anticipation for tonight's Vice Presidential Debate. Joe Biden took six days off to prepare for it. President Obama took just two days off - well three, if you count his actual debate.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Astronomers have discovered a planet that is twice the size of earth and made of diamonds. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See, that's amazing. President Obama says the planet may be inhabited by aliens not paying their fair share.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, here's something kind of cool. Archaeologists said today they believe they have found the exact spot in Rome where Julius Caesar was stabbed to death. And this is a very historic moment. It marked the last time in history a group of Senators crossed party lines and did something together.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the US Anti-Doping Agency has released a more than a thousand page report saying that beyond any doubt; Lance Armstrong and the US Postal Service team - that's who he rode for, US Postal Service team used performance enhancing drugs. They said they first became suspicious when they saw something sponsored by the post office going very fast.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight, the Vice Presidential Debate. Excited about the Vice Presidential Debate? A lot of people say, 'Who cares? The Vice Presidential Debate? Who cares?' Let me tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, one of these two gentlemen will be walking the White House dog.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Before the debate Paul Ryan said he would stick to the facts. Well, see, he's already lying.&quot; David Letterman: Top Ten Thoughts Going Through Paul Ryan's Mind At This Moment: ['Time' magazine photos] 10. These weights are 100 pounds each 9. My biceps are cut like taxes for the wealthiest one percent 8. Of course they won't publish this on the most important day of my political career 7. My flaccid smirk will motivate Americans to get in shape 6. What's the worst people will say about me and a photo of a dumbbell? 5. There's no three-day waiting period at this gun show 4. Please, please, ask me to take my shirt off 3. Why are the people giggling? 2. Please, please, ask me to take off my shorts. 1. Maybe now people will take me seriously. Jimmy Fallon: &quot;There's a lot of pressure on Joe Biden at the presidential debate tonight after the President's weak performance against Romney. When he heard Democrats were counting on him to say the right things, Biden was like, 'You can count on me, bitches.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;And this is big. Today, 'Time' magazine published a bunch of pictures of Paul Ryan working out. Have you guys seen these? ? Come to the debate, stay for the gun show.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;A new poll found that only 47% of voters find Mitt Romney to be trustworthy. Then Romney was like, 'Well, I hope it's not the same 47% I don't care about.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;This week, President Obama's Facebook page received more than one million 'likes' in a single day. Yep. All of them from Republicans who watched last week's debate. 'We like you. We like you. That was fantastic.'&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;It's autumn. Don't forget to go outside and watch the beautiful changing of Mitt Romney's positions.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Tonight was the big Vice Presidential Debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan in Danville, Kentucky. The whoop-ass in the blue grass, the bare-knucky in Kentucky. Now, I haven't seen it yet. Nor will I ever. It's a Vice Presidential Debate. But for the record, I'm betting - I know what who is going to win because the key to winning one of these debates is to lower expectations about your speaking skills. And Biden's been doing that for four years.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Thousands of people all over town are expected to gather to watch the space shuttle Endeavor roll through the streets. Last month, they threw it on the back of a 747. ? Tomorrow, they're going to roll it through the streets of LA to the California Science Center where it will be on permanent display. The shuttle is five stories tall, weighs 77 metric tons, which is about 170,000 pounds. Maybe they should have done this before gas prices went up to $5 a gallon. They're not rocket scientists - oh, wait, they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you know, watching TV last night, I see this stupid infomercial for Crest Whitestrips. Have you seen this? It goes on for like an hour and a half with this guy just smiling. Then I realize it's Joe Biden. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm watching the debate. That's not Crest Whitestrips. That's Joe Biden. I guess you know the Obama campaign has a new strategy. They've gone from 'Hope and Change' to 'Smirk and Giggle.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I thought the moderator, though, Martha Raddatz, she did a great job on the debate. I think it was really smart of her to cut Joe off after that third scotch and soda.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And like Jim Lehrer with the presidential debate, she's [Raddatz] is also being criticized for losing control. See, the problem is they always use these news people as the moderators. You know what you need? A Catholic nun with a big ruler. 'Ryan, get your facts straight!' 'Biden, wipe that smirk off your face or I'll wipe it off for you.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And we also learned a lot about Joe Biden's policies last night. As you know, he has come out very, very strongly against malarkey. And believe me; the pro-malarkey people are not happy. Who's he running with, Calvin Coolidge? Malarkey?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, there were a couple of really funny jokes during the debate. Like when Ryan referred to the Saudis as our allies. Kills me. And the way Biden kept referring to Ryan as 'my friend.' He'd go, 'my friend,' and 'my friend believes.' As you know, 'my friend' is political talk for 'up yours.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Today, Sarah Palin weighed in on the debate. Palin said that Joe Biden was sent in as an attack dog, as opposed to four years ago when Sarah Palin was sent in as a deer in the headlights. It was totally different.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is warning motorists about the dangers of counterfeit airbags. Have you heard about this? For example, if your airbag has a little tube coming out of the steering wheel you have to inflate with your mouth before the crash that's probably a counterfeit airbag, okay.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Well, the US Anti-Doping Agency now says that Lance Armstrong and his cycling teammates engaged in the most sophisticated doping program the sport has ever seen. And I quote - this is their quote ? 'employing such elaborate tactics as pretending not to be home to elude testing.' Well, with that kind of craftiness, I'm surprised they got caught at all, huh?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Oh, last night, the Vice Presidential Debate. How many of you saw that? Yeah, sure you did. Jim Lehrer was at home, Jim Lehrer, who moderated the Presidential Debate, the first round, was at home. He wanted to watch the Vice Presidential Debate, but he lost control of the remote.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Paul Ryan accused Biden of hypocrisy on the Federal budget. And Ryan accused Biden of underdeveloped triceps.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;What I'm learning about the election, it all comes down to a handful of states, what they call the swing states, you know, like Ohio and other states that are swing states that I don't know. And so they concentrate-- the campaigns really, that's where they are pour all their money and their attention and man hours. For example, Governor Chris Christie, a high-profile Republican, was in Ohio stumping for Romney. And it was felt as far north as Canada.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;I'm your host, Jimmy Fallon. And I'm going to try to tell these jokes before Joe Biden interrupts me.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Joe Biden actually interrupted Paul Ryan 82 times during last night's Vice Presidential Debate. Even the ladies from 'The View' were like, 'Dude, wait your turn.' That's right. Biden aggressively contested nearly every claim his opponent made during their debate, and President Obama was like, 'Wait, you're allowed to do that? I didn't know.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;I want to wish a happy anniversary to Bill and Hillary Clinton who got married 37 years this week. Yes. I was like, 'Thirty-seven years, how do you do it?' and Bill was like, 'We don't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This clip has been all over YouTube and everyone's talking about it. You know the guy who broke the sound barrier? Amazing. Yesterday for the first time ever a man plunged 24 miles from the very top of the earth's atmosphere. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah. As a result they've stopped serving liquor on the International Space Station.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Presidential election getting close. I'm glad too, because this election has been going on for I think 44 years now. The Obama campaign is releasing a new ad showing Americans whose financial situation has improved over the past four years. Unfortunately, the only person who appears in the ad is Mitt Romney.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Polling across the country shows the presidential race is now neck and neck. Yeah. It's an even tie between not Barack Obama and not Mitt Romney.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Second Presidential Debate is tomorrow night. A lot of people were saying last week's Vice Presidential debate was a draw, did you see it? I watched it. I thought it was a battle between Joe Biden's smile and Paul Ryan's smirk.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;In this debate, they're going to be relying on crazy Uncle Joe Biden for damage control. ? Not only was Biden not his lovable gaffe-tastic caricature, the fellow must have upped his Adderall prescription because he was fact-checking this debate in real time. ? 'Sorry, Paul. Numbers-wise you've got your head up your ass.' One of the great pleasures of Thursday night was watching how many different ways Biden implied Paul Ryan was lying without actually saying the word 'lie.'&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Oh, what a shock! Congratulations, Europe. You gave yourself the Nobel Peace Prize. ? Oh bravo, Europe. So well deserved. After all, it's been a whole 13 years since your last genocide. By this logic, I should get the Nobel Prize for not murdering anyone lately. Oh, that's right. I'm no longer eligible. But since political unions can now win Nobels these days I've got to ask, how about one for the United States of America? Because I don't know about you, I seem to remember someone putting an end to a couple of dustups that Europe started. What were they called again? Oh yeah, World War I and World War II. No biggie! We had plenty of free time digging ourselves out of the Great Depression. Oh, and who spent billions on military bases all over Europe to keep the communists from boot stomping your waffle stands and your Vespa dealerships? Oh yeah, oh yeah, we did! That's when you stepped up and called on us again. Oh, you know what, you should have called Norway. You seem to be on great terms with those guys. Well, you know what? Maybe the United States will just take the next global conflict off. Keep us and our massive peacekeeping military at home. Maybe give ourselves a People's Choice Award. After all, we haven't had a war since 1945-- that we've declared.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;A new ABC News and 'Washington Post' poll asked voters some very strange questions about the candidates. Among other things they asked voters which candidate they would trust more to babysit their children; 49% of voters said they would rather leave their kids with Obama, 36% chose Romney and the rest just like, 'Why are you asking me this?' I would probably, if I had to pick, I would probably pick Obama. You know, if you can change Joe Biden's diaper, you can handle anything.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Another Secret Service agent ran into trouble with the law, this time in Florida. A Secret Service agent named Aaron Francis Angler was found passed out drunk on a Miami sidewalk 7:00 a.m. on Friday. He was part of the advance security team for the President's visit last week. Once the President left he went out for a drink or ten or something like that. It sounds like like they recruit these Secret Service agents at bachelor parties in Las Vegas. When the police tried to arrest him he resisted, even hit one officer on the chin. He was charged with misdemeanor disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest. On the bright side, he was too drunk to get a hooker. Baby steps, I think they call them.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;It's not a great day for the ladies of 'The View.' ? Anyway, Barbara Walters announced this morning they were snubbed by Mitt Romney. He was scheduled for an interview, but he canceled at the last minute. ? Apparently Mitt Romney wants to limit his appearances to places where no one will attack his positions. You know, like the debates.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;It was a big weekend for Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who broke the world record for skydiving. He jumped off a balloon 24 miles high. He fell to earth so fast he broke the sound barrier. That's fast! He fell faster than President Obama's poll numbers after the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Obviously tonight was the second Presidential Debate - which I totally watched. And it's not taking place until three hours after we tape the show. I can't believe Mitt Romney cut off Obama's hand and then told him he was his father.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;First, Election Day three weeks away. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or to put that another way, I cannot believe this thing is still three weeks away. We examine the nation's emotional state in the nation's new segment 'Please for the Love of God, Make It Stop.' Controversy once again tonight. Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan at a campaign stop in Georgia - kidding he was in Ohio. Is there another state other than [bleep] Ohio? Not in October there isn't.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Anyhoooo he [Ryan] was campaigning when he decided to volunteer at a homeless shelter. One little problem. ? Do you know how hard it is to make volunteering at a homeless shelter look like a negative thing? And how dead inside does a national presidential campaign make you that you could be handed clean dishes and instead of saying, 'You know these are clean, right,?' You go, 'Where is my scrubby sponge?' ? Apparently Ryan did wash dishes but they were set aside and left unclean specifically so they could take pictures of him selflessly washing dishes - because we're so [bleep] dumb - believe he was caught in the act of volunteering. Later food was withheld from nursing home patients so Ryan could arrive and reanimate them through the magic of applesauce.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;You broke into a homeless shelter to take a picture of you maybe or maybe not washing already clean dishes? If you're going to try to manipulate people's emotions through prefabricated scenarios put some oomph into it. That's the social contract between you and the voters. If you don't give a [bleep] about the homeless at least give a [bleep] about making us think you give a [bleep]. Don't phone in cynicism. It would be like Joe Biden putting a hard hat and goggles and posing in front of a Cheesecake Factory. He's like, 'It says factory on the outside, for the love of God.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;The Romney/Ryan ticket is firing on all cylinders which say huge improvement for Mitt who was previously just firing people. Now he's got the edge heading into tonight's all important presidential debate. In that unlike Obama he was there for the first one.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Tonight, the second of three big debates between President Obama and Mitt Romney from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, moderated by Candy Crowley from CNN. It aired on every channel. Why should it be on all channels? The Super Bowl is on one channel and we seem to be able to find it.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;The agreed on subject for the debate tonight were foreign and domestic issues. Which pretty much covers everything, doesn't? Where else is there besides foreign and domestic issues? Space, I guess?&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;The President gets a lot of criticism or got a lot of criticism for not being aggressive enough in the first debate and tonight he immediately karate chopped Mitt Romney in the throat.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Tonight's debate was what they call a town hall format which is where real voters get to ask questions and then the candidates ignore them and just talk about what they wanted in the first place. They found 82 undecided voters to ask the questions. In other words they 82 of the most confused people in the United States to lead this discussion. If at this point you are still undecided, you shouldn't be allowed to vote for 'Dancing with the Stars'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;There are a lot of rules for tonight. 'Time' leaked what was supposed to be a secret agreement between the campaigns that has very specific rules that covers just about everything you could think of, including size of the candidates' dressing rooms have to be the same, the chairs they sit in. It reads like the backstage rider for the most boring rock band ever.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;You too, ladies. Does it look like that? Anyway, everybody, of course is talking about the Presidential Debate the second debate was on earlier tonight which I watched. It was awesome. I liked the part when Mitt Romney said 'Boooo, China,' and Obama was like 'Yay, old people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Conan: Yeah, people still talk about last night's debate. It was a debate for undecided voters. People who are still undecided. They still haven't made up their minds. Don't know if you saw at the beginning, Jeremy, the college kid, who asked the first question at last night's debate now says he's no longer undecided. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah. When asked to elaborate he said, I'm definitely moving to candidate.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;There was good news though for Jeremy last night. During the debate, Mitt Romney. Did you see this? Mitt Romney offered him a job right there on TV, offered him a job. Jeremy starts his new job in China next Tuesday.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;During the debate, one audience member asked how Mitt Romney was different then President Obama. Yeah. And president Obama said, that's obvious, I would never do anything to hurt Big Bird.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night Mitt Romney said when he was looking to hire a female he would browse through binders full of women. Yeah. Romney said he got the idea from Tom Cruise.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;One of the voters in the audience last night who says he's still undecided was an African-American male. There was an awkward moment when president Obama said, bro, seriously?&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;You know, they keep coming out with these little fun facts, these polls. New research finds that Obama supporters tend to eat at Red Lobster. They tend to eat at Red Lobster while Romney's supporters tend to eat at the Olive Garden. Yeah. When he heard this, Chris Christie endorsed both candidates.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Next week Larry King will moderate a debate between third party candidates. This is the first debate Larry's moderated since the one between Cain and Abel.&quot; Craig Ferguson: &quot;Larry King is moderating a presidential debate between third-party candidates on the Internet and I think this could be awkward. Most Americans have never heard of these candidates and Larry King has never heard of the Internet.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;Hey, did anyone in this room watch the debate last night, the presidential debate? I didn't like it. I thought it was uncomfortable. I don't know why they have to argue all the time. It's ? the whole thing was very tense. Sometimes passive aggressive. Just like being with your family at Thanksgiving.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;In fact, I think they officially kicked the holiday season off last night with the debate. CNN poll today said that 46% of viewers who watched thought Obama won and 39% thought Mitt Romney won. So, it looks like Obama's strategy of staying awake through this one paid off.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;I don't know who won last night. They both talked for a long time. Nobody fell over so I guess they're both winners.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;The things people seem to be talking about today, something Mitt Romney brought up on the subject of equal pay for him. When he was filling cabinet positions as Governor of Massachusetts, he went out of his way to hire women. He said he had, quote, 'binders full of women,' which is a little creepy. Binders full of women? That's something they'd find in a serial killer's basement at the end of a 'Law and Order: SVU.'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;It's weird he would bring that up, right? Maybe for Mitt Romney that's the closest thing he ever got to looking at a dirty magazine.&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;As you know, last night the presidential campaign headed to Hofstra University where the candidates debated before a diverse crowd hard of Long Islanders ranging from Italian guys to other Italian guys to a Jewish guy and his mom. Such diversity in Long Island.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Hey, hey, let me ask you something, everybody see that debate last night? I mean, Romney clearly won. And, folks, I am not just saying that, I am saying that on TV. So if you're an undecided voter who did not watch, just trust me, it is 2 and 0. Even though, even though, folks, the night was clearly stacked against mitt. After that first debate debacle, Barack Obama had definitely won the low expectations game.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;But for all of his triumph over the gotcha questions, the unfair moderators, the slightly taller chairs, none of that is how mitt won this one. No, this fight was over before it began as Fox News.com trumpeted 'Romney Smokes Obama in Pre-Debate Coin Tosses.' Yeah. Romney smoked him. He won three out of four coin tosses. What are the odds? Like one in a million?&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Coin toss, always a huge part of the debates since the Lincoln/Douglas rock paper scissors went on for hours without a winner. They had to settle it and ended up flipping a penny and Lincoln won by calling me!&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Now the four flips that last night were to staging, order of questioning and spouses order of introduction. Romney won the coin tosses the same way he is winning this election, by calling heads over and over again, then calling tails like he always has.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;And folks, there is a good sign, folks, this is a good sign for Romney's chances with undecided voters, because if at this point in the campaign you are still undecided, just flip a goddamn coin already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact today they both pledged to increase domestic production of Ryan Gosling movies.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;People still talking about the debate. Very heated thoughts and comments about that second debate. Yesterday Mitt Romney's son Tagg said that during the debate, he wanted to punch president Obama for calling his father a liar. He also wants to punch his father for giving him the name Tagg.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Endorsements rolling in for different people. The National Atheist Party has endorsed Barack for president. Yeah, yeah. Atheist party. Yeah. When told the news Obama said, 'Thank God.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hey, another ? this is cool, the creator of the cartoon Gilbert announced that he is supporting Mitt Romney. Meanwhile, the creator of Garfield is still waiting to the candidates' views on lasagna and Mondays.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel: &quot;Speaking of silly names, Mitt Romney's oldest son, Tagg, two Gs, there he is, did a radio interview yesterday. The host asked what it was like to sit there while President Obama challenged him the other night and Tagg said he wanted to, quote, 'take a swing at him.' Or at least have his butler rush down and take a swing.&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;We're only 19 days away from the election. And President Obama's Hollywood allies are already trying to steal it. He's been endorsed by everyone from George Clooney to Neil Patrick Harris to Beyonce and Jay-Z to Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres and Stephen Spielberg. It's like an episode of 'Dancing with the Stars' but with stars. And so far my man Mitt just has Clint Eastwood, Donnie and Marie Osmond, the lady from Northern Exposure and I want to say Joy Behar's older sister.&quot;</SPAN></P>

They're gonna dress up as Romney and Ryan and go scare seniors.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Well, listen to this. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, for Halloween, sales of Obama masks are 30% higher than the sales of Mitt Romney masks. Well, that makes sense. I mean, what's scarier than four more years of this economy?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Tonight was the third and final Presidential Debate. The good news? Tonight was the third and final Presidential Debate.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's kind of cool? The debate tonight was special 'cause it was broadcast in 3-D. It's as if the candidates were reaching in and taking your wallet right out of your pocket.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Tonight's debate was in Boca Raton, Florida. So, not only are the candidates up against 'Monday Night Football' and the Major League playoffs, they also had to compete with 'Wheel of Fortune,' which is huge. Nobody in Florida watched tonight.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And tonight's debate was on foreign policy. You know the first thing President Obama should have said to Romney? 'Hey, how many Al Qaeda guys you killed?' See, that's what I would have said.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;You know, shouldn't they combine economic and foreign policy into just one debate? I mean, think of that. We get our money from China; all our goods from Japan, our workers from Mexico, our jobs are all in India. Our economic policy is our foreign policy. It's all the same.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of Hollywood stars becoming more vocal. Lindsay Lohan has endorsed Mitt Romney for President. Lindsay Lohan. This could be just the thing that puts Obama over the top.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And the 91-year-old female mayor of River Falls, Alabama, has been convicted of stealing $201,000 from the town treasury. She's 91 years old. And I've asked this question many times. Where are the parents?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You know what happened earlier tonight. The final Presidential Debate. And people - when I say people, I mean pundits - pundits are saying that the first debate was won by Mitt Romney who came out swinging. What a power house, and a force to be reckoned with. He came out punching. They say Mitt Romney won the first debate. Now the pundits are saying the second debate was probably won by President Obama. Whoever wins the third debate, that's the one held tonight, will meet the Tigers in the World Series.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Latest polls shows 6% of registered voters undecided. Six percent. Make up your mind! For the love of God! Two years? You don't know who you're going to vote for? You're not undecided. You're idiots. Pick one! Come on. Those are the guys you see in the Baskin Robbins asking for free samples. 'Can I try the shoe leather?' 'Let me try the chocolate swirl with the custard?' 'Do you mind? How about the mocha twist? Could I try a little?'&quot; David Letterman: Top Ten Signs You Know Nothing About Foreign Policy 10. You think Benghazi is that bald guy who played Gandhi 9. Always refer to the United Nations as the 'UN' 8. Promise that on day 1, you'll stand up to General Tso 7. You praise Madagascar's hilarious talking animals 6. You think Arab Spring is a brand of soap 5. Refer to every world leader as 'What's-his-name' 4. You think the G-8 is a hot boy band 3. Speak to people from other countries with generic 'foreign guy' accent 2. Know Qaddafi was killed, but still worry about Gaddafi, Khadafi and Khadafy 1. Made it your mission to prevent Iran from enriching geraniums. Conan O'Brien: &quot;Tonight President Obama and Mitt Romney debate foreign policy. That's the topic. Pundits say it will be close but it will probably go to the candidate who wore the 'I Killed Osama bin Laden' t-shirt.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the 'New York Times,' I found this interesting, the Google search, 'Paul Ryan Shirtless' is nine times more popular than the Google search 'Paul Ryan Budget.' Yeah, the awkward part is most of those searches have been traced back to Joe Biden's laptop.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Donald Trump says he will reveal big news about President Obama on Wednesday. Yeah, Trump said he would have announced it sooner, but faking a Kenyan birth certificate is harder than it looks.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today, Lance Armstrong was formally stripped of his seven Tour de France titles due to his doping scandal. On the plus side, he did just receive a Nobel Prize for chemistry.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;The final presidential debate was held tonight in Boca Raton, Florida, and was moderated by 75-year-old Bob Schieffer from CBS News. Seventy-five-years old, Bob Schieffer. Yeah, 75 years old or, as Florida residents call that, a tween. When the ladies of Boca got a look at Bob, they're like, 'Who's the fresh meat?'&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Today Donald Trump said he has a very big announcement about President Obama that could cost him the election. Yep, he's going to endorse him.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Donald Trump has a very big announcement regarding President Obama. Apparently, he has evidence that Obama was born in 'Romnesia.'&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Nation, tonight is the third and final Presidential Debate between former Governor Mitt Romney and future former President Barack Obama. I'm tivoing it, so nobody tell me whether the moderate or conservative Romney kicked the lethargic or energetic Obama's ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch the debate last night? I got to admit, I was one of those undecideds. Couldn't decide whether to watch the baseball game or the football game. I didn't know which.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, President Obama finally found a Republican that agreed with him - Mitt Romney.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of President Obama's winning points last night was about how sanctions against Iran are crippling their economy. And believe me, if anyone knows how to cripple an economy, it's President Obama.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;I thought Bob Schieffer did a great job. Before the debate, Bob Schieffer instructed the audience not to clap for any reason, because in his house, that makes the lights go on and off. Well, this was not Bob Schieffer's first time. No, no. He also moderated a Bush-Kerry debate in 2004 and a Lincoln-Douglas debate in 1858.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from competitive cycling for life after overwhelming evidence of his participation in illegal doping was finally made public. You know, like a lot of people, I wanted to believe Lance. But it was obvious he was on something, you know? Like that one year when he won the Indianapolis 500.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And energy analysts say that gas prices could drop below $3.35 a gallon by Thanksgiving. The bad news? Turkey will be 80 bucks a pound, okay?&quot; David Letterman: &quot;You know, wherever you would fly you go to an airplane airport and go through a body scanner and it goes through your clothing and they would see you naked and look for exploding devices on your naked body? Well, the Highway Transportation Safety Board or whoever's in charge - They said 'We're gonna do away with the scanners.' Thank God, they're going back to the old-fashioned groping.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;How about the Presidential Debate? Are you a little tired of the presidential - do we even need a President? I mean, we could be in this condition without a President, don't you think? Last night, did you see the debate? Oh, my - let me ask you this. Did you learn anything new last night? No! No, it's the same stuff over and here's what's different. The first debate they were at a podium. First debate it was podiums. Second debate stools. Stools. Last night chairs and desks. Chairs and desks. Now the next debate yoga mats.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;But after the debate last night, experts agreed that Obama, President Obama, won on substance and I said well, big deal, Lance Armstrong won on several substances!&quot; David Letterman: &quot;And then the candidates - after this real ugly bitterness and arguing face to face, toe to toe then at the end the families rush up on stage and all of a sudden they're chummy and they're friendly and it was - last night it was crazy. What's her name? Ann Romney. And I thought this was out of line and God bless her, she's a lovely woman but somebody ought to get a hold of her, you know? Here's what she did. She goes up to Mrs. Obama and says 'You and the kids should come visit us at the White House.'&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;That was some debate. If you didn't see it, let me talk to you a few minutes to alienate you. You know what's crazy at one point, the moderator Bob Schieffer said 'Obama bin Laden.' Yeah, it was right before he called Romney 'Adolf Mittler.' True story.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;During last night's debate, President Obama told Mitt Romney, 'The 1980's called and they want their foreign policy back.' Yeah, Mitt Romney tried to deliver a comeback but then his beeper went off. Yeah. He had to fax Pat Benetar.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;As we get closer to Election Day, a lot of crazy rumors are starting to surface about the two candidates. A man is claiming that President Obama used and sold cocaine in college. On the bright side if this is true, it means Obama does have business experience.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today a poll found that President Obama won last night's debate among a voting block known as Wal-Mart moms. That's true. And Mitt Romney won the debate according to the voting block wouldn't be caught dead at Wal-Mart moms.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Last night was the third and final Presidential Debate. So now, if you want to see people yelling at each other on TV, your only options are 'The Real World,' 'The Real Housewives of New York,' 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey,' 'Jersey Shore,' 'Mob Wives,' 'Basketball Wives' and the judges table on 'American Idol.' But that's it.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Last night's debate, it was held in Boca Raton, Florida, and Romney actually has a three-point lead among Florida voters. Of course, there's still one major obstacle, making sure those voters are still alive for the election.&quot; Jimmy Fallon: &quot;And this wasn't good. During the debate last night, moderator Bob Schieffer mistakenly referred to Osama bin Laden as Obama bin Laden. Everyone at CBS News was really embarrassed, while Fox News was like, 'We'll take him. That guy's great.'&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, last night was the third and final presidential debate. It threw much-need attention to two key domestic issues, 'Monday Night Football' and the National League Championship. As you remember, folks, the first debate was a blowout win for Romney. The second debate-- also happened. So let's get the truth of night three in 'Stephen Colbert's Debate 2012 Coverage.' Two men, one wheel. Who gets to drive us over the cliff?&quot; Stephen Colbert: &quot;Not only is Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb, if you think about it, everybody is. Even me! Admittedly, I'm still far away. The Mentos and Diet Coke stage. But still.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Third and final debate between the major candidates went on in Florida last night. Think it was either a debate or the most boring episode of 'The Voice' ever. The chairs didn't even spin. Did you watch this? The topic was - don't get too excited about yourselves. Foreign policy was the topic. Most polls after the debate had the President winning decisively. CBS News poll of undecided voters had Obama ahead 53 to 23%. I had just enough of these undecided voters. You can imagine going out to eat with these people? 'The cobb salad looks good. The turkey burger how is the turkey burger?' Just order something. I find it annoying that the people who can't decide are the one whose decide this.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel : &quot;Very interesting, did you know it's possible we could wind up with a President Mitt Romney and Vice President Biden. It's true. If there is a tie in the Electoral College, the Senate picks Vice President and House picks the President. The Senate leans Democrat and House leans Republican so they would presumably pick Romney and Biden. If that happens they should make them share an apartment. That would be great. Romney and Biden. A dog on every roof and a foot in every mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the debate on Monday, Mitt Romney's son Tagg apologized to President Obama for saying he wanted to punch him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a busy, busy day for the President. President Obama's travelling 5,300 miles in just one day. That breaks the previous record set by Lance Armstrong on his bicycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting, even though he's spending all day on Air Force One ? you know there's an office on the plane where he can work? And it's just like being in Washington. You know, he's got the desk, he's got the computer. Even has a closet that has a group of Republicans who pop out and block anything he tries to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in history, the United States post office has reached its borrowing limit from the US Treasury. US Post Office cannot borrow more money from the United States Treasury, you know why? Because the United States treasury has reached its borrowing limits from the Chinese treasury. That's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's what people are talking about today, with just two weeks left in the presidential race, there's talk that Mitt Romney is now refusing to do any more TV interviews before Election Day. When asked why he didn't want to make any more public statements, Romney was like, 'Uh, because I want to win?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll do whatever it takes. In fact, a source close to Romney just revealed that he gets a spray tan before major campaign events. Yeah, I guess that explains Romney's new Secret Service code name ? the 'Mittuation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more campaign news, yesterday Obama visited the swing state of Ohio for the 17th time this year. Seventeen times, people there are so used to seeing him, now when he shows up they're like, 'Oh, hi, oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, this is interesting, you guys. A new poll found that 59% of Americans would rather eat a burger with President Obama, while only 41% would eat one with Mitt Romney, while most Americans don't care who they're with as long as they get that burger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Obama releases his college applications and records and passport information by 5:00 p.m. on Halloween trump will give $5 million to charity. It seems like a trap Lex Luther will say. Will it be the orphans or your secret identity? He seems to think he is a contestant in an imaginary game show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the debates are over. And all that's left right now is to set up and rig the voting machines. Once they get those in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen it's time for tonight's top ten list... And tonight's category, thoughts going through this baby's mind at this moment. You're saying hey, Dave what are you talking about. Here is exactly what I am talking about. There's the baby, top ten thoughts. This is the oldest political clich? in the history of politics, out on the campaign trail, kissing babies an there's Mitt Romney kissing a beautiful little baby right there. And we don't know where this is, Florida, Ohio, somewhere. But look at that gorgeous little baby. Well, that's the list tonight, top ten thoughts going through this baby's mind right at that very moment:&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. &quot;Make the campaigning stop!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. &quot;I hope I'm not being used as a political pawn&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt's family, his sons are all named Plug, Box, Hoop, and Peter and ? unusual names. So the baby is thinking now, ruminating this guy should not select my name.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Home sales are up. That's certainly good news?And, do you know the most expensive home for sale in the country right now? The White House. That's right, the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest poll, 80% of the people polled are sick and tired of hearing about the latest polls. That is the latest poll news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?He flew to a rally in Las Vegas last night. However, he did not visit any of the casinos. You know why? When you're $16 trillion in debt, they don't let you in, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama is now on a six state tour. It was going to be a 12 state tour, but he saw the price of gas, so they cut it back to six states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump said that if President Obama releases his college and passport records, it will end the anger of many Americans. Who's angry about where Obama was born, really? How many are more angry that Donald Trump was born?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen to this. Celebrity endorsements are rolling in. Lindsay Lohan has endorsed Mitt Romney for president. In fact, she said she would be happy to put a 'Mitt Romney for President' bumper sticker on her car if her car still had a bumper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Times,' intelligence officials believe Iran is planning a series of cyber-attacks against the United States. So be careful - if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sends you a friend request on Facebook, don't accept. Okay, don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the final stretch of the election, and president Obama's been campaigning so hard these last few days that he went 40 hours without sleeping. I guess that explains his new motto, 'hope and go-go juice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's been really busy. In fact, tomorrow, he's going on MTV to answer questions from college students. Questions like, 'will you legalize weed?' 'When will you legalize weed?' And 'anybody got any weed?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Mitt Romney still isn't sure if he'll do an MTV interview, but he does want to pitch MTV his own show 'Jersey Offshore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the campaign, while he was at a diner this week in Ohio, a man told Joe Biden that he's a good guy, but a bad Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The First Lady is here on the show to encourage us to vote early. A: it's great, because it's important that everyone makes their voices heard. And B: on Election Day, you don't have to spend the morning inside an old lady's garage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Democrats are more likely to vote early than Republicans. Most Republicans are opposed to voting early because they believe that voting starts at conception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm looking forward to interviewing the First Lady. I sat next to her when I hosted the White House correspondents dinner. Hard to have a conversation with Newt Gingrich yelling 'you gonna eat that' over and over again in my ear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama now getting some criticism for calling Mitt Romney a BS-er, I don't think that means big spender, in the new interview in 'Rolling Stone' and you know Mitt Romney - you know, Mitt Romney doesn't swear.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Halloween on Wednesday. Are you excited about Halloween? ? But Halloween is a-- it's like second in American holidays to Christmas, almost. I mean, it's a huge holiday. People go out pretending to be something they're not, looking for handouts. It's like running for President. It's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, happy birthday. She is 65 years old today. Happy birthday to Hillary Clinton.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, here's the schedule of the finishing up of the campaign and the election. The debates are finished now. November 6, very important. You have to vote. I don't care if you go out and vote for a canary. I don't care; you have to cast your vote. That's November 6. November 9 it will be the recount. November 9 will be the hotly contested recount.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, here's an odd side note to the presidential election. You never think about stuff like this. I never thought about it before.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw a great show on the History Channel. It's called 'What is the Earth Worth?' And it added up all the world's items to come up with the value of our planet. And they came up with $6 quadrillion 873 trillion. That means if Mitt Romney is elected, the earth would have to pay almost $7,000 in taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was talk about delaying the election because of the storm. Let me tell you something. We're Americans. We can handle hurricanes. We can handle floods. What we can't take is one more day of this stupid campaign, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources say that Hurricane Sandy was partly caused by global warming. Meanwhile, Fox News said it was caused by two men kissing in Central Park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. We do have a presidential campaign to think about. Former Governor Jeb Bush said during the campaign, President Obama has been acting like a 10-year-old. His exact quote was, Obama's acting like a 'Real George W. Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First off, thanks to our great audience for making it to the show tonight. I'm so glad you're here because last night's audience was the worst. I don't know if you guys caught the show last night, but because of the hurricane, we had to do the show to a bunch of empty seats. Or as Clint Eastwood calls that, 'A full house.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the presidential race continues. Did you forget about that for a few days? Maybe the only good thing about the hurricane, we forgot about the presidential race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama and Mitt Romney, well, Mitt Romney resumed campaigning today. He was visiting those hardest hit by the storm and that would be swing state Latinos. He went right in to see what he could do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you, I had a trick-or-treater tonight, stood outside on my porch for an hour, didn't ring the bell, didn't knock on the door. Who are you supposed to be? He said, 'I'm an undecided voter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And economists say rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy will give the ailing construction industry a huge boost. In fact, the storm has already created more jobs than President Obama has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government seems to be doing a good job, although you have never guess who criticized president Obama. Do you remember Michael Brown? 'Heck of a job brownie,' Michael Brown? The former director of FEMA who was forced to resign after Hurricane Katrina. On Monday, he criticized the President. He said Obama may have acted too quickly. Instead of taking the wait and do nothing approach that worked so well during Katrina. That is an interesting point coming from a former FEMA director and current Applebee's employee of the week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg announced that all cars coming into New York City via the bridge musts have a minimum of three people in them. Unless one of the people is very, very fat in which case, two people but no sodas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And make no mistake, folks, this hurricane has got 'election' all over it! Out of sensitivity, less than one week from Election Day Mitt Romney has been forced to suspend his campaign. That's why he scrapped his victory rally in Kettering, Ohio and instead appeared at a completely different, the same spot, with the same people and called it a storm relief rally. Which is so comforting for all those living on Ohio's hard-hit Atlantic coast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it's one week before the election and Christie is praising a Democrat. What's next? A Democrat praising Christie? It's unnatural! It's like kissing your sister! Which, by the way, will be Federal law if Obama is reelected.&quot;</SPAN></P>

They see that what needs to be done and they come together. And this is the mark of great minds, guys with great minds and great hearts. They put politics aside, they see the problem and they go right after it. And they toured many devastation sites. And they have the same pledge to get New Jersey up and running as soon as possible.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Wall Street bankers said today, hurricane sandy caused $50 billion worth of damage to the economy. That's a lot, but it's still not as much damage done by the Wall Street bankers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City is still dealing with the effects of Hurricane Sandy.

That's right, you can't cross the bridge with a bunch of empty seats, which is really confusing for Clint Eastwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the election, I read about a 108-year-old woman in South Carolina who just voted for the first time. She voted for Eisenhower, but still, good for her for just getting out of the house and?that's right. A 108-year-old woman voted for the first time and revealed that she voted for President Obama. And when asked if she thinks Obama can improve the economy, she was like, 'What the hell do I care? I'm 108 years old.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Mayor Bloomberg has now officially endorsed President Obama. In fact, after Mitt Romney heard the news that the mayor was endorsing Obama, he got so mad went out and bought a 30-ounce soda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of states now allow early voting. You know, we should expand on that idea. Let's not limit it to this election.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the attack in Libya is still being investigated and we will find out what happened. But until we do, he suggested that Americans should not watch to Fox News or listen to talk radio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like there's another sex scandal brewing. Whoo, just in the nick of time. Politics is getting boring. These two women from the Dominican Republic said that Democratic New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez paid them for sex earlier this year. One woman was quoted as saying she only got $100 of the $500 he promised. Hey, I got news for these women, okay. You're not the first ones to get screwed by a Senator. Okay? ? The girls wanted $500, but he only gave them $100. See how frugal these guys are when they're spending their own money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unemployment in Europe has hit a new high. That's when you know things are bad, okay? When even foreigners are now losing American jobs. That's not good. Not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks ready to vote? I don't know if we still have any of those undecided voters. 'I don't-- gee, I don't know, I don't know what I'll do.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for the Republicans. Once the polls close on Tuesday, they'll be able to bring out Paul Ryan again. He's been hiding with Mitt Romney's tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is reminding everybody about changing your clocks. He's urging his voters, his constituents and all Americans to turn your clocks back to 1954.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, after it was announced that unemployment went up last month, today Romney said the economy is at a virtual standstill. Coincidentally this is also what it looks like when Romney tries to dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Mitt Romney, yesterday in Virginia Romney criticized President Obama for making puns about his name like 'Romnesia.' He said it's just an 'Obama-nation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, some good news today for Mitt Romney, he was endorsed for President by the boss from 'The Simpsons.' Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns endorsed Mitt Romney. You know what that means? That is the second cartoon character to endorse Romney right after Donald Trump, so that's - that's kind of interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama's campaign adviser, David Axelrod said that Obama's final campaign speeches are coming from his loins. That's what he said. They are coming from his loins. Now, don't confuse that with Joe Biden. He's talking mostly out his ass. That is totally different. Don't get that confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, 63% of the Chinese want President Obama to be re-elected. They want him re-elected in China. Well, sure. I mean, in this economy, what landlord wants to deal with a new tenant. Right? You've got to repaint the place, give the security deposit back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, today is the last day of the presidential campaign. Boy, just flew by, didn't it? So here's the rundown. Tomorrow is Election Day. Wednesday will be the recount. December 18th the Supreme Court will give the election to Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These poor guys. I don't know, they're still out campaigning and it's hard to believe that they've been going at it and going at it. Today President Obama is in Ohio. One of those key states. Republicans got to win it; Democrats got to win it; it's a key state. Mitt Romney is back in his neighborhood up in New Hampshire campaigning. Joe Biden is in Pennsylvania. And Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan today is in the gym.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in South Carolina voted for the first time, early voting. Voted for the first time in her life. She's 108 years old. Went into the voting booth and pulled the lever for Calvin Coolidge. What's the matter with you, lady? And then Mitt Romney heard about this and he said 'Women can vote? When did that happen?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, the lines for early voting are nine hours long. Nine hours. Which is too bad, because it's Florida, a lot of those people don't have nine hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Ohio yesterday a man who heckled President Obama was carried away by four police officers. Not because he was a danger but because any time you carry a person from Ohio, you need four people. You have to use your lower back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what people are talking about. After months of buildup and anticipation, the election is just one day away. Which also means only one more day of campaign ads. I'm Jimmy Fallon, and I definitely approve that message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a bunch of theories going around about who's going to win tomorrow. One study shows that President Obama has an 86% chance of winning the election. Yeah. I don't want to say Obama's getting cocky, but today, his last stop on the campaign trail was to see a matinee of 'Wreck-it Ralph.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Paul Ryan went tailgating at a Packers game with two of Mitt Romney's sons. Yeah, Romney was going to go himself until someone told him what tailgating was. [As Romney] 'You mean people eat out of the trunk of a car like a hobo? No thanks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it is no secret; it is absolutely no secret why there is electricity in the air tonight. Nation, it is election eve. Just hours left in the 2012 campaign. Both candidates are pulling out all the stops. Here is the President's final two days, Florida, New Hampshire, Colorado, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa. Let me show you the Mitt Romney schedule. He's trying to go into Pennsylvania. It's Florida, it's Virginia, it's New Hampshire. So if you live in one of these states, 'The Colbert Report' is now issuing a severe candidate warning. Be prepared with fresh water and flashlights and please, if you have a single working class female suburban undecided voter in your home, cover her with plywood. Or she could just get sucked up into a vortex of pandering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no official relationship to either campaign. I haven't even signed up for any of their emails but somehow and this is true, last week the Obama people just found me. And have been sending me emails. Of course it just started last week so I've only received 600 of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turn out the vote is particularly crucial for Obama because while polls show him ahead of Mitt Romney among registered voters, among likely voters they're tied. Although among unlikely voters they're both being beaten by a Honey Boo Boo marathon. Now the Obama campaign needs to get those registered voters to become likely voters. And folks, they have a secret weapon to do it. According to a 'The New Yorker' article on the Obama campaign, the best way to mobilize voters, they discovered, is through shame. Something Catholics have known for centuries. That's why Jesus keeps getting re-elected. And folks, of course Barack Obama is the leader in shame-based campaigning. Mitt has a handicap because given how many times he's flipped positions, he may not understand the concept of shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I'm sure you're aware the presidential election is tomorrow. Tomorrow Americans will go to the polls, elect a new leader and go home for Thanksgiving to fight about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Is everyone here planning to vote? I hope so. It's important. Remember, voting isn't just a right; it's also a couple hours off of work tomorrow. Oh, here is a voting tip, something I learned the hard way. If they give you a cookie instead of a sticker tomorrow, you didn't vote, you gave blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the campaigns are finally over and we don't know what's happened yet. But candidates finally get a chance to relax. Today, I don't know if you heard this, President Barack Obama played a game of pick-up basketball. Yeah, Obama said, 'Listen, I'm beating a white guy at something today. I don't care.'&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday did you all see the Obama rally, the big Obama rally? Yesterday Jay-Z appeared and he altered some lyrics and he said I got 99 problems, but a Mitt ain't one. That's it. Mitt Romney is never going to listen to Jay-Z again. He's through with Jay-Z&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Mitt and Ann Romney cast votes near their home in Massachusetts. Then they cast votes near their homes in Virginia, Ohio and Florida. They flew to the Caymans and cast some votes there.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President did a lot of last-minute interviews. He did 15 interviews yesterday and said a lot of crazy stuff. President Obama said yesterday his weakness is nachos. And his advisers said relax, you've already got the Hispanic vote.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7-Eleven has weighed in. At this moment 7-Eleven's presidential polling contest has President Obama winning re-election. That's according to 7-Eleven. Yeah. However, those results are being hotly disputed by polling experts at Outback Steakhouse. And then we got to hear from Long John's Silvers. Arby's hasn't weighed in.&quot; Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have some preliminary results. Pennsylvania which as you know is a great state named after the great pendulum has gone, most precincts reporting, to Barack Obama. The electoral vote. Obviously that was a state that Mitt Romney at the very end made a play for, but the Amish said, 'homey don't play that.'&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the Colbert report is ready to project that CNN has projected that animal planet has predicted that the winner of the 2012 presidential election is Barack Obama. Yes, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I did read that well. America has elected its first black president for an historic first second time. Of course let's remember, Obama is only half black. It is possible in his second term he will be white. At this point, I think he owes that to us.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly folks, I'm stunned, I really thought Romney would win. Now I'll never get to see the inaugural ball and his first dance with Refalca.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now think about this. Just think this through, folks. Now Obamacare is here to stay. So a single illness won't wipe out your life's savings. But at what cost? A lower one? And now you have to wait for hours in line for medical scare instead of immediately not getting any.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a smattering of Obama supporters here tonight, right? No, go ahead, enjoy yourselves. Because folks, you bought it. You bought the lie. Hook, line and sinker. America's a quick drunk and an easy lay. Apparently we have to show up in a nice suit, give free healthcare, save the auto industry and kill bin Laden and that old girl will put out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what made a big difference last night? The Hispanic vote. Yeah. I'm with you, amigos. I don't think I convinced anybody with that. This is true. The President got 70% of the Hispanic vote in Colorado and Nevada. And in New Hampshire, Obama got the support of both Latino guys. Karl's and his cousin Carlos.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney did well with certain voters. It was close. He had the support of men, people over 45 and married women. Yeah. In other words, Mitt Romney had the support of Mitt and Ann Romney. Solidly in their corner.&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long national nightmare is finally over. We have expressed our will at the polls. The results have been tallied and we proved once again that American democracy is alive and well. Even if Florida was more confused than an old person with an iPhone.&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the most part everybody behaved. Republicans were gracious. Democrats were humble. Pretty well ?most of them anyway. Last night Big Bird snuck out of Sesame Street and dropped a deuce on Romney's limo. But apart from that?&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really think in all of what happened yesterday, the only person who should be considered a 'loser' is in fact Donald Trump. I'll tell you why. He went on Twitter demanding a revolution. I'm like whaaat? So far no one's listened to him because he's Donald Trump. After that, Trump tweeted 'the world is laughing at us.' I'm thinking, uh-uh, Donald. The world is laughing at you and I will tell you why. I will tell you why. This is why: it is because you're wearing an orange face and a crazy wig.&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Obama is reported to be paying back the many people who helped him win, giving a phone call here, a signed picture there. And for Bill Clinton, gift cards to Hooters.&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night of course Colorado and Washington passed measures legalizing marijuana. Yeah. Both of these great states can look forward to some fabulous visitors.&quot; Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor of Colorado made a speech last night reminding citizens that smoking weed is still against Federal law. I'm not making this up. He said, and I quote, 'Don't break out the Cheetoes or Goldfish too quickly.' He said that. Stoners are like, 'dude, put them away. The governor can see us on TV!'&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night for the Democrats. Obama won the electoral vote, and the popular vote. Mitt Romney, on the other side, won the unpopular vote.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People talking to Mitt, and he waited until 1:00 a.m. to get his concession speech up and running and they were talking to him afterwards. 'Mitt, who are you going to do now? You have some time off?' 'Well, I plan to spend some time with my tax returns.' That's what he said he'd do.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is a good category because everybody was watching last night. Top 10 signs that you were watching bad election coverage. Now, it's gotten to be very sophisticate. I mean, they can?when you get up in the morning, they can call an election like that. But then in, like, 2000, they got burned pretty bad, so they don't call it like that. But they knew a week ago how this was going to go down. So it's highly sophisticated and a lot of it has to do with projections. So signs now that maybe what you're watching is not really good coverage.&quot; 10. &quot;Kept calling Republican candidate 'Milt' Romney.&quot; 9. &quot;Germophobic anchorman refused to operate touch screen.&quot; 8. &quot;Viewers advised, 'actual voting results may vary.'&quot; 7. &quot;After each state was called, anchor painted one of his teeth red or blue.&quot; 6. &quot;Too much attention paid to exit polls in Canada and Mexico.&quot; 5. &quot;Electoral map drawn on anchorman's shaved torso.&quot; 4. &quot;For reasons unknown, news desk crawling with raccoons.&quot; 3. &quot;The interactive map became self-aware and destroyed the studio.&quot; 2. &quot;When Colorado passed Amendment 64, news anchor lit up a joint.&quot; 1. &quot;They still won't call Ohio.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to President Obama on being re-elected President of the United States. So, congratulations. But, turns out it is all not bad news for the Republicans. I guess ? seems depression is covered by obamacare.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some more good news, the President announced today, he is not going to raise taxes on the entire one percent. Just Donald Trump. Just Donald. That's the only way out. &quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Trump has not given up. When it was announced that President Obama easily won the Electoral College, Trump demanded to see Obama's Electoral College records.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Trump is starting to lose it. At one point last night on Twitter, he called for revolution. The man is a billionaire who owns golf courses. Okay? You don't call for revolution. Billionaires are the first ones beheaded during a revolution, okay?&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately after the results of the election were announced last night, both Michelle Obama and Ann Romney did the exact same thing. They called and cancelled the movers. Yeah.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Joe Biden said today that now the election is over, he is going to take a vacation. You've been Vice President four years. That is your vacation!&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama had a lot of celebrity endorsements. Bruce Springsteen. In fact, in her stage show, Madonna urged her audiences to vote for President Obama. Do you know what's unbelievable? Madonna has been right in every election since Calvin Coolidge. That is amazing. That is amazing to me.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, the stock market plunged over 300 points. Do you know why? Romney pulled his money out.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I thought Mitt Romney was very gracious last night. He gave a very sincere - gave a very touching concession speech. He really did. And the good news for Romney, he can still run for President of the Cayman Islands.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what else? Exit polls showed that President Obama did well with women beating Romney by 11 binders.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, congratulations, President Obama on his second term. Of course, today, everyone was busy looking at all the different numbers, trying to figure out who voted for which candidate. This is very interesting, it turns out that President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 38 points among single women. They say it's because of Obama's final campaign slogan: 'Hope and Pinot Grigio.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President also got a lot of help in the election last night with 70% of the Jewish vote. When Jewish voters heard their support for Obama was so high, they were like, 'eh, it could have been better.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a hard-fought election, and Mitt Romney did not give up easy. In fact, the Romney campaign would not concede Ohio, even after every major network declared Obama the winner. You could tell Romney was getting desperate when he said, 'Let's wait and see what the food network has to say. They have a voice just like all. Let's see what honey boo-boo has to say about it.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Colorado became the first state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. You can tell Colorado is weed-friendly because they just renamed that one team, the Denver McNuggets.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, Colorado legalized marijuana. It's good news for Obama, in fact, he's expected to create over six million jobs in the hacky-sack industry.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you hadn't heard, President Obama defeated Mitt Romney last night. We know this for sure despite the fact that the returns from Florida still have not been counted. Some people had to wait five, six hours to vote there. What goes on in Florida? They had four years to fix this and ? four years to fix things before that. We need to make sure Florida never gets the Olympics.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President got 303 electoral votes to Romney's 206. Obama led among women and minority voters while Romney led among white males and Banana Republic manikins.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney lost his home state of Massachusetts. Paul Ryan lost his home state of Wisconsin. I would not want to be Paul Ryan's shake weight today.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are wondering what the President will do differently in his second term. I'm hoping Obama announces this will be the black half of his presidency. The last four years were pretty white. I'd like to see him put a little more funk in it. I'd like to see him turn this mother out for a change.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard a lot of people say over the last few weeks that if Obama wins, they're going to move to Canada. How come nobody threatens to move to Mexico? Must be depressing for them. They're just as close. They're closer to us here.&quot; Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps the best news was in Florida. After months of Republican governor Rick Scott attempting to suppress democratic voter turnout, and attempting to decrease voter discomfort and my favorite introducing a 10-page novelette state ballot to people who couldn't handle a (bleep) one-page ballot. Florida remains too close to call. What is the good news, you say? The election was decided without them.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, keep in mind, keep in mind, this was no landslide, folks. It was like a 51-49er, okay. Just because Obama won the blue states up here, he's the President of all of them now? Romney won all that red stuff. Why don't we elect our President on square footage, because Romney won some big states, folks, the whole damn south. Louisiana, N'awlins loves Mitt Romney.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, but, evidently, here's the deal. Of the nine key swing states, Obama won eight. I don't?I mean how? even Pennsylvania, despite the fact that after a week of Hurricane Sandy, thousands of Amish remain without power.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a big election the other day. Not everybody's happy. A lot of people still coming to grip with Mitt Romney's loss. This is a true story. I'm not making this up. It was reported, just reported that the morning after the election, Mitt Romney's family gathered to share a gallon of chocolate milk. That's true. In other words, they took it much harder than we thought.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's two weeks until Thanksgiving, seven weeks until Christmas and seven weeks before they're done counting votes in Florida. Can you believe that? They are still counting votes in Florida as of now. Yeah. They're still counting votes even though the election is no longer in doubt and the people who cast them are no longer living.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see, some changes are expected in the Obama Administration. Hillary Clinton is likely to step down. When he heard about it, Bill Clinton said, 'That's great. Just give me a heads up when she's on her way home.'&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Karl Rove was running the Republican deal. He spent 400 million dollars. Four hundred million dollars to try to get his party in power. Four hundred million. They don't know what happened. The Republicans are confused. They're scratching their heads. They won't know what happened until they find the black box.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have political insiders tell me that Mitt Romney ? and he seems like an upbeat guy ? that he's depressed. Mitt Romney is depressed. He just sits in a darkened room watching videotape of that first debate over and over and over. But his wife Ann said Mitt, 'You have to cheer up. Go spend, you know what will make you feel better. You have to cheer up. Go spend some time with your money.' So he's going to do that.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are talking about their open to compromise when it comes to fiscal cliffs. They say we have got the fiscal cliff coming. We're open to compromise. That's what the Republicans are saying. And I'm saying what the hell have you done with the real Republicans?&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, indefatigable. I don't care whether you love her, don't have opinions or don't like her, give her credit. She has done this job. She has flown and traveled. And when she travels around the world and visits various countries, trouble spots and friends alike, she's not over there playing cards. She speaks the thoughts of the president. She is the personification in these foreign lands of President Barack Obama. It's an endlessly fatiguing job. And she said if it weren't for her Teflon pants suit she'd probably?&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I called them and I said do me some research, find out how many two term Presidents there have been in the history of the United States. Pretty small club, two term presidents. The only club smaller is Latinos for Romney. That is the only smaller club. And then the only club smaller than that is the Latino women for Romney. That would be the next smallest club.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how they ? remember during the World Cup soccer they had an octopus that predicted the winners of the World Cup soccer. Remember that, there are always little things like there is a donkey somewhere that predicts interest rates. And there's always little things you look for. Like the Redskins. Do the Redskins win before the election? It means one thing if the Redskins lose. I knew Obama was going to win. And I'll tell you how I knew this. A little secret, use it next time there is an election and see if it doesn't work out. The guy who wins the presidential election is usually the guy who kills bin Laden.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Florida votes have finally been counted, and it is official ? George Bush has beaten Al Gore. So there you go.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an interesting fact about Tuesday's election. It seems 41% of Romney voters were named either Osmond or Romney. I was stunned by this.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there is one silver lining about Mitt Romney losing the election. At least now, he doesn't have to move into a smaller house.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I thought he was very gracious in his concession speech. Let me tell you, it is very tough to lose an election like that. You know what Romney is doing now? See what he did today? He's rehearsing for 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, NBC News was the first to call the election President Obama. ABC News was the first to call a cab for Diane Sawyer.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that? Do you know this story? Did you watch it? What is going on? Well, the rumor is, Diane Sawyer allegedly had been drinking on election night. In fact, today, Mitt Romney called and said, 'You got any left?'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama easily won his home state of Illinois. In fact, in Chicago, Obama got 120% of the vote.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the exit polls, President Obama won every category of voter in New Hampshire. Rich to poor, young to old, white to whiter.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Colorado voters have legalized the use of recreational marijuana. Fifty-three percent voted yes, the other 47% percent always thought it was legal.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's photo of him hugging Michelle has become the most retweeted photo of all time. Take a look at this photo. And if you're wondering what the least retweeted photo of all time is, well, here you go. It's Karl Rove. Karl Rove on the beach.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Tuesday night, Mitt Romney's staff briefly published his victory website by mistake. Yeah, Republicans called it an embarrassing error, while Big Bird called it 'the scariest two minutes of my life.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the election, there are now a record number of Latinos in Congress, which has a lot more Americans talking about immigration reform. Americans seem to be in favor of it, while immigrants are still on the fence.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Congress does nothing, the US could go off a so-called fiscal cliff that could cause another worldwide financial collapse like the one in 2008. Congress had a lot of questions about this scenario, like, 'What do you mean if we do nothing?'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always wonder what the day after the election is like for the candidate who loses. You get so close to becoming the most powerful person in the world and just like that, you wake up, you hope to get a call from 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though the election has been over for two full days, the state of Florida still doesn't know who they voted for. Four counties in Florida were still counting today. It's important that they get all of the votes counted because the numbers could drastically affect the outcome of this election in no way whatsoever. No one is exactly sure why it's taking Florida so long.&quot; Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in Kenya gave birth to two boys on Tuesday and in honor of the election, she named them Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. I don't know which is which, but ? after all this, it turns out Mitt Romney was born in Kenya, too. How about that?&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, I'm afraid that this new storm could hurt Romney's momentum. I mean it could slow him down. I mean he already lost the election that can't help. But of course Florida is still being counted. So folks I'm still hanging in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hope everybody went out today and hugged a veteran, unless your name was Paula Broadwell - then you shouldn't be hugging - That's a great name, isn't it? Doesn't that sound like a spy from one of the James Bond movies? 'Mr. Petraeus, this is Paula Broadwell, and her German friend, Heidi Assengrabben.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that is the big story, the head of the CIA, and former general, David Petraeus has resigned because of an extramarital affair. Well, you know how he found out that his wife knew? When he got home and saw all his classified documents in the driveway on fire.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing that Petraeus got caught 'cause you'd think as head of the CIA, it would be easy to cheat, right? I mean, you come home late, the wife goes, 'Where have you been?' 'I'm sorry, honey, that's classified. I would have to kill you if I told you, I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida has finally finished counting their votes! What is wrong with Florida? Huh? Why is it so hard for the people down there to count votes? I mean, we're talking about a state where half the population can play 10 bingo cards at the same time. Why is it so hard to count a bunch of votes? What is their problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're now saying that Hillary Clinton is expected to leave as Secretary of State. She's denying rumors she plans to run for President in 2016. Hillary says all she wants to do is sleep. If she just wants to sleep, be Vice President. That's the job. That's the job. That'd be perfect!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'USA Today,' Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is expected to step down soon. He said he'll seek a job in the private sector. Apparently nobody told him there are no jobs in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well both parties in Washington now agree that our country is headed towards a fiscal cliff, that's what they said. We're heading straight towards a fiscal cliff. The bad news, we just elected a guy whose campaign slogan was 'Forward!' Oh, we're in great shape. The Republicans drove us into a ditch, and the Democrats are driving us over a cliff. Fantastic. Fantastic. Couldn't be better. But the good news is President Obama says we'll run out of gas long before we get to the cliff. Don't worry about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Iran is now claiming that a drone from the United States has violated Iranian airspace. I didn't even know Joe Biden was out of the country. Did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colorado voters voted there to legalize youth and recreational marijuana. You know, the state has a new slogan, 'It's 4:20 somewhere!' In the wake of Colorado and Washington State legalizing of marijuana now the Mexican government is reassessing its role in the war on drugs. In fact, they're now threatening to stop doing nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that CIA Director General Petraeus. Well, allegedly had an affair with his biographer which means from now on he'll only be having sex with his autobiographer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But listen this. James Bond beat Abraham Lincoln at the box office. Boy, it's really been a lousy week for Republicans, hasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's turn our attention now to Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney put up a good fight but did not win. He's not our new President. Mitt Romney, okay. Okay, well-- and now he's got to get rid of all of his campaign staff, his workers, his researchers, everybody went out. In fact, today Mitt Romney fired the five actors who played his sons. But don't worry about Mitt. He's already lined himself up a Flomax commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are still in shock. They're saying what the heck happened? And you know what it was, they overlooked the Latino vote. They didn't recognize the power of the Latino vote. So they're already trying to make it more inclusive. Paul Ryan, remember a guy named Paul Ryan? He was going to be Mitt Romney's Vice President. Well today he announced he changed his name to Pablo Ryan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans still will not admit that they underestimated the power of the Hispanic vote. As a matter of fact, Latinos are calling this 'cinco denio.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The James Bond movie, 'Skyfall,' came in number one this weekend with $88 million. Yeah. This is about a spy who fights terrorists and sleeps with a lot of women. Critics are calling it 'well-made,' while David Petraeus is calling it 'relatable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, after all the confusion at the polls in Florida last week, Governor Rick Scott said that he will review ways to improve the state's voting procedures. Yep, it will be the biggest thing Scott's done since he won that raffle to become governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You'll be happy to know that the presidential election officially ended this weekend, four days after the polls closed. The votes from Florida finally came in. Saturday they cast their electoral votes for President Obama and also declared Philip Phillips the winner of 'American Idol.' They're slow. I'm surprised how slow they are. I know there are a lot of older people in Florida but have you ever played bingo with old people? They're lightning fast. They're like ninjas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mitt Romney may have lost Florida but has a supporter in Indiana. Eric Hartsburg thought it a good idea to have the Romney/Ryan logo tattooed on his face. He'll feel stupid when he finds out about campaign buttons. Even Mike Tyson was like, 'That's a ridiculous tattoo.' Judging by the photo the guy has made a lot of bad decisions from the neck up. While he is a Romney supporter, he did this for money and auctioned a 5x2-inch spot on his face on eBay. The winner got to pick whatever tattoo they wanted. The winner was a Romney supporter so he paid $5,000 to have it emblazoned on his face. I wonder if laser tattoo removal is covered under Obamacare. That would be ironic, wouldn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tricky day for general David Petraeus. The CIA Director resigned. The FBI caught him having an affair with his biographer. Groping civilians on the government dime, General Petraeus? You work for the CIA, not the TSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Skyfall,' the number one movie at the box office this week, made over $100 million. It's the biggest opening ever for a 'James Bond' film. And it's really good. But, you know what's interesting, there's not a lot of sex in the movie - very downplayed. See, James Bond, he's just a secret agent, it's not like he's head of the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we are getting closer and closer to this fiscal cliff everybody keeps talking about. They say there's gonna be huge military cutbacks. In fact, the Pentagon may have to lay off as many as 6,000 mistresses.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you disappointed in Petraeus - people are disappointed. Four star general, highly decorated, brilliant strategist, director of the CIA. Yet, he's behaving like your common congressman&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Gilbert, Arizona, a woman ran over her husband with her car because she was so angry that President Obama won re-election. Well, I guess her husband didn't vote, her husband didn't even bother to vote - this made the wife so mad she ran over him with the car. And who says women didn't support Romney? There's one right there. All right. She's a psycho. The good news, the husband that got run over with the car, he's covered under Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are now starting to analyze last week's election results. Newt Gingrich said in an op-ed piece today, that the GOP needs to stop talking and start thinking. And then Sarah Palin gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty wacky, about Texas wanting to secede from the United States. You know about this? A petition for Texas to secede from the United States has gotten 60,000 signatures. And Mexico is hoping it doesn't pass. That would mean they'd have to cross another country illegally to get here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report out this week, the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia to become the world's biggest oil producer in less than, what - six years from now. And we'll be energy independent 10 years after that. You know what that means? We'll have no one left to invade but ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got through the election. The campaign lasted two years, we get through the election, President Obama wins and now we're worried about what, fiscal cliff. Do you have any idea what the fiscal cliff is? Neither do I. Do we care about the fiscal cliff? Of course we don't care about it! We have no money to begin with. What do we care? It's the fiscal cliff! Nobody knows what it is. The President appointed the commission and we're going to find ways to make new money and I was thinking of one - like Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, she goes everywhere. Here's what we do. Wherever she lands in a foreign country, slips and falls we sue the pantsuit off of them. What would be wrong with that? Bank! Sell a state! We've got too many of them. Sell a state to somebody. Sell a state to Oprah. Oprahoma. There you go! Making money left and right. Sell some big rich dope a place on Mount Rushmore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's news from the world of auction houses. News from the world of auction houses, Christies last night auctioned off a 76 carat diamond. Yup. I believe it was purchased by General Petraeus for his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. A woman is so angry with the election results that she jumps in her car and runs over her husband. She's mad that Romney didn't win, so mad, gets in the car, bang, zoom, runs over her husband. It was Karl Rove's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Paul Ryan? He was Mitt Romney's Gilligan, his little buddy Gilligan. And he wanted to be Vice President and it didn't work out. They did some of those focus groups and it turns out people didn't want a Vice President with two first names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fact, David Petraeus was reportedly not well liked at the CIA where he worked. Yeah. A tip to you fellows out there, don't cheat with your wife if you work with professional spies who don't like you. That just seems like a recipe for disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a rare 76-karat diamond went up for auction in Switzerland. The jeweler called it a priceless stone while David Petraeus' wife called it a start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I know, job creators, see me at camera three. Thanks for joining me, I know you've got a busy schedule job creating and the bootstrap pulling and all so I'll keep this brief or I'll proactively downsize the time span intensity of our dialogue vis-a-vis - whatever. All right. Guys I get it, providing healthcare benefits to employees cost money and as a group you tend to prefer things that do not cost that. I watch 'Undercover Boss.' But own your layoffs and your policies. Let's stop pretending that suddenly this election bosses have been transformed into reluctant [bleeps]. Obamacare is just the latest excuse to wriggle out of the social contract. For many years full time benefits like sick days, maternity leave, pensions, lunch hours, chairs, have disappeared by magically transforming full-time workers into independent contractors or part-time 20-year temp help. Want to avoid paying half of your employees' social security tax? Reclassify them as independent contractors so they pay it all themselves. Make them fill out a 1099. That's not a full-time busboy, that's Juan Co, LLC. 'Don't forget to invoice us, Juan Co.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not that you guys [job creators] don't have a legitimate gripe against this President. If Obama had fought harder for single payer healthcare business owners like you would never have to pay another premium in your lives. You could stuff your pizza crust with money and still sell them for $10 and if Obama banned natural gas fracking then coal wouldn't be getting its ass kicked in the - what's it called, again? Free market. So maybe next time take all the millions you donated for partisan political purposes and pump it back into the type of healthcare advances that may ultimately increase business productivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US pays almost a billion to support the first family. Granted, most of that money just goes to making fake birth certificates or hair gel. Depending on who the President is.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I've tried to take a look at this Petraeus case and figure it out. You have two four-star generals involved here, several women involved, one set of twins and a guy ? a shirtless guy from the FBI and I'm ? don't you miss the simplicity of the Clinton years?&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the thing that I'm having trouble with, the piece of the puzzle that I don't get, is you've got the FBI. Somehow the FBI decides we better look into this. They don't really know what they're looking into but they decide we have to look into this. And the guy in charge of looking into it gets involved with a correspondence with one of the twins. I'm not sure about that. But at some point, he decides what needs to be done and needs to be done immediately is shirtless photos of himself need to be texted to someone. So he takes pictures of himself half naked and he shoots them off. I mean this guy should not be in the FBI. This guy should be in Congress.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God, do you believe how complicated this Petraeus scandal is getting? First, he had an affair with that Paula Broadwell woman. Then, she sent harassing emails to this other woman, Jill Kelley. And then this Jill Kelley may have been having an affair with another general. No wonder we don't know what's going on in Libya&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, this whole scandal has changed the way the White House does business. Like, you know the 'Situation Room'? It's now the 'Compromising Situation Room.' They've changed it.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something I mentioned last night - a woman in Arizona ran over her husband with her jeep because she blamed him for Obama getting reelected. See, I don't think the woman's being fair. If Obama hadn't saved the auto industry, she wouldn't have been able to run over her husband with an American-made car. So there you go right there.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, in a landmark medical breakthrough, doctors in Canada say they are now able to use an MRI to communicate with people whose brains are in a vegetative state. You know, if this technology had been around during the Republican primary, Rick Perry could've been president today.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And friends are describing Mitt Romney as 'shell-shocked' that he wasn't elected president last week. Apparently, he thought the job was all his, and then the job, of course went to somebody else, to which Phil Jackson said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news - it turns out that Democrats are actually considering Mitt Romney's tax plan as a way to avoid the fiscal cliff. Yeah, three weeks ago, Obama was like Mitt Romney has a terrible idea. And now he's like, hey, are you going to finish those ideas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans still reeling from their electoral defeat last week and reassessing their outreach efforts after suffering enormous erosion of support amongst Asians, Latinos and African Americans or, as Republicans sometimes refer to the groups: the reason their kids didn't get into their first-choice schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the election, 20 states ? you know we have 50 states in the United States, 20 states said we've got to get out. They said we can't take it anymore, so 20 states are working on seceding from the United States of America. Now here's what I'm talking about. We're facing real money problems. Real economic crisis. So take those 20 states that want to leave and charge them $10,000 apiece on their cleaning deposit. Good-bye fiscal cliff, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, after the elections, for the first time in two or three years, President Obama held a press conference. Anybody get a chance to see it - didn't he look tremendous? I mean, after that grueling campaign. ... And Barack Obama, ready to go - always ready to go. But yesterday, he looked especially good. He looked relaxed, like he was ready to lead. So, he took questions from the press for 20 minutes then finished up with a few Al Green songs. It was nice.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is in town today - did you realize that? Yup, he's visiting the places that were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. And visiting people who lost their power. And the people ? oh, the people who lost their power, yes, those are Republicans, but that's a different story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, this year they have new balloons for the kids. They have elf on the shelf. That will be big. Who wants to stand in sub-zero weather and sleep looking at elf on the shelf. All right, how about Papa Smurf, ladies and gentlemen. How about the shirtless FBI Agent? That's a new balloon. He'll be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of this General Petraeus deal is a guy investigating it for the FBI - an agent that investigates without his shirt. He likes to take pictures of himself without his shirt and shoot them around at various people and somehow he became involved in the Petraeus and the other generals and the CIA thing, and I thought now this rings a bell. Oh yeah, at the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover used to do the same thing, except it was usually in a backless evening gown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here's tonight's Top Ten list. The category tonight, Mitt Romney scapegoats. This is what I was talking about. He's blaming his loss of the election on other things, not taking responsibility for himself. He is the titular head of the Republican Party. He's?forget head, he's the face of the Republican Party. So, he should take responsibility for their miscalculation and their poorly conceived policies and antiquated ideology. Thank you very much. Top ten Mitt Romney scapegoats:&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. &quot;The ancient Sumerians who invented arithmetic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. &quot;Properly functioning voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. &quot;People unwilling to get a Romney/Ryan face tattoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. &quot;Actual goats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. &quot;Congressman Todd Akin's biology teacher.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. &quot;Fact-checkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;The Republican Party for nominating him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;Shirtless FBI agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there are now reports that President Obama will name Massachusetts Senator John Kerry to be the next Secretary of Defense. Apparently this is part of America's new defense strategy to bore our enemies to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard these stories about these states that want to secede from the union? I guess it started with Texas. Texas always wants to do this. Well, as of this morning they've gathered over 700,000 signatures all across the country from people who want to secede from the United States. Which is not a bad idea. I mean, we all secede. We change our name to like, instead of United, the Together states of America. And China gets stuck with the bill. Sorry. We're the 'Together States.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama says any budget deal must raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. But Republicans warn that taxing millionaires and billionaires could prevent them from becoming trillionaires. Let's not just think of ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market is going down faster than a general's biographer. It is terrible out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, on the way to work, I saw Phil Jackson holding a sign: will coach for food. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, James Bond switches from Heineken to Colt .45. That's how bad it's gotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Paula Broadwell is now being forced to sleep with only three-star generals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, MSNBC had to lay off 300 Obama spokesmen. That's how bad it's gotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, President Obama sent Susan Rice out to defend it. That's how bad the economy is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After rumors arose that President Obama was thinking to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with UN Ambassador Susan Rice, John McCain ? oh he got furious. He said he would do everything in his power to block Susan Rice from this position because Rice is unqualified and out of her element. I don't want to state the obvious here, but didn't he pick Sarah Palin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well this just in today, BP, British Petroleum, has agreed to pay $4.5 billion in settlement of criminal charges in the Gulf oil spill. In other news, BP announced it is raising the price of gas by $4.5 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama gave his first press conference since being re-elected. And a lot of people are saying it looked like he was trying to cover up some of his gray hair. So I guess Obama's major goals include jobs for women and 'Just for Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more news out of Washington - during his final speech on the House floor yesterday, 77-year-old Congressman Ron Paul said the Constitution has failed. Which must be a bummer, 'cause he's actually one of the guys who signed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, President Obama hosted a screening of the new movie 'Lincoln' at the White House. Yeah, after the movie, Joe Biden was like, 'Whoa! I did not see that ending coming! Anyone else? Anyone else?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are looking for a job, Facebook just launched a new app. They teamed up with the Department of Labor to create what they call the social jobs app. You can browse through two million job listings. You know its bad when even Facebook thinks it's time for you to get a job. Facebook also has an app that can help you lose your job. It's called Facebook. Try it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A packet of love letters washed up on the beach after Hurricane Sandy. In all the debris they found a packet of love letters. More bad news for General Petraeus. This guy can't get a break. Just can't get a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And General Petraeus testified today before Congress. They want him to appear earlier in the week but he was busy shopping for a futon for his new studio apartment, so he had to get that taken care of. Petraeus was asked questions today about the attack in Benghazi. You know first thing he said was? 'You want to know about Benghazi, oh, yeah, no problem. Phew! Yeah. Ask me anything you want. No problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we are learning more and more about this Paula Broadwell who was General Petraeus' mistress. Turns out she's also a reservist in the United States Army. In fact, she's a lieutenant colonel. Which complicates things because Petraeus was having an affair with a subordinate. Which was against the regulations. Which is also awkward. I mean, a general having sex with subordinates. 'How was it?' 'Good, sir, best sex I ever had, sir.' 'I can't hear you!' 'Best sex I ever had, sir!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Broadwell, as I mentioned, is a reserve officer and military intelligence. How can you be a reservist and be in military intelligence? I mean, they only work one weekend a month, right? 'Oh, it looks like the Taliban is regrouping. Oh, 5:00. See you in December.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, and after searching Paula Broadwell's home, the FBI found classified material on her personal computer. The material they found was labeled 'top secret,' which I never understood that, labeling files top secret. I mean, don't you want to peek when something says top secret? You know what I'm saying? You're going to peek, you're going to look. The government should be smarter. If they don't want people to look, label it 'Joe Biden's speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the owner of 40 Denny's restaurants announced that he plans to charge customers a 5% surcharge on their bills to pay for Obamacare. And let me tell you something, you should pay it. Because if you're eating grand slam breakfasts, you're going to need Obamacare. Okay? You're going to be first. You're going to be signing up for that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney told a group of donors this week that he blames his defeat on gifts Obama gave to minority voters. Hey, let's not forget the gift the Republicans gave to President Obama - Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something silly and you think about what's really going on in the world, but yet we do it year after year after year. On Wednesday, next Wednesday, President Obama will pardon the White House turkey. Pardon the White House turkey. And then, I don't know how you feel about that, but the following month, he will pardon the Hanukkah brisket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, General Petraeus testified before a closed congressional hearing. He brought a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big. Hostess, the makers of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos, has announced it's going out of business. Now, the only place you can find Ho Hos or Ding Dongs is at the Pentagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is now claiming that he lost the election because President Obama gave gifts, like healthcare and student loan forgiveness to young voters and minorities. Yeah. Giving voters stuff to improve their lives or as that's also known, being the friggin' President. Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>

And there's a woman involved who is writing his biography. And he apparently was sexually involved with his biographer. ? Now the woman who is the biographer, the woman who was involved in the affair, guess who she hired for this? Guess who she hired? That's right, Monica Lewinsky's crisis manager. And I said, 'Whoo! That is a genius move because that guy really kept a lid on things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then you know, Mitt Romney over the weekend, he and his wife, the lovely Ann Romney, go out to a movie there and they're watching the vampire movie. One day you're running for President of the United States. The next day you're waiting in line at the Cineplex. President Obama's on Air Force One now trying to maintain world peace somewhere. Mitt Romney's watching the 'Twilight' saga eating popcorn with a fork.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to AAA, an estimated 43 and a half million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home over the Thanksgiving holiday. That shows you two things. We love to visit our relatives over the holidays. And the rest of the year, we want them at least 50 miles away. And boy, don't be flying tomorrow. Busiest flying day of the year. Oh, my God. It's gonna be so jammed up. Listen to this. TSA agents said to speed things along, passengers are being asked to grope themselves, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Thanksgiving turducken. You know what that is? Turducken? That's a chicken stuffed inside a duck, stuffed inside a turkey. Now, don't confuse that with the Petraeus sex scandal. That's a general stuffed inside a biographer, stuffed inside another general, then stuffed inside a socialite. That's totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for General Petraeus. After searching the home of his mistress, Paula Broadwell, the FBI said it found classified material on her personal computer. In fact, agents said she had more information about Benghazi than our UN Ambassador, Susan Rice, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some good news. Happy birthday to our Vice President. Joe Biden turns 70 today. Yeah, happy birthday to him. Interesting. I was reading his bio. It said he started talking at nine months old and hasn't shut up since. Still going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to reports, a lot of Republicans are still holding a grudge against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his cooperation with President Obama following Hurricane Sandy. They say he helped Obama get re-elected more than any other Republican except Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says that Congress should lift the debt ceiling to infinity. Geithner argued that it shouldn't be Congress' job to place limits on how much we can borrow. And you know something? He's right. That's China's job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, today they put Ebay up for sale on Ebay. That's how bad it is. The economy's so bad. The economy is so bad, Taylor Swift wrote a song attacking the Federal Reserve. That's how bad it is. You know Big &amp; Rich? They changed their name to Little &amp; Broke. That's how bad it is. The economy is so bad, Paula Broadwell was forced to go back home and sleep with her own husband. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After months of campaigning and Secret Service protection, a photo of Mitt Romney pumping his own gas was just posted online.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say happy birthday to Vice President Joe Biden, who turned 70 years old today! Right after Biden made his birthday wish, he was like, 'Let me ask you just one question. Am I invisible right now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why this is so interesting to me but it is. Mitt Romney was spotted pumping gas. Here he is at a Chevron station.

Now, he's Goober from 'The Andy Griffith Show' pumping gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how this can happen but police are now investigating how some confidential records, including bank routing numbers ended up as confetti in New York City's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese are now planning to construct the world's tallest building.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie 'Red Dawn' opened over the weekend. Oh, it's a stupid movie. It's a remake of the original 'Red Dawn.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's new president said that his country's problems with the US are not just about drugs and security issues. Yeah. He said it's really about America's insistence that Taco Bell is Mexican food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's not forget that there's always something out there to scare us. For instance, when the clock strikes 12 on New Year's Eve you can kiss your date and you can kiss our economy good-bye. ? Yes, the dreaded fiscal cliff. An unavoidable plunge to the razor-sharp financial rocks below. It all started back in 2011 during the showdown over raising our debt ceiling when Republicans wanted spending cuts and Obama wanted to raise taxes. Which led to a budget crisis that Congress solved by not solving it. Instead, they handed it over to something called 'the Super Congress' which couldn't fail because it was super. Unfortunately it was also Congress so it failed. As a result, folks, we are facing another thing called sequestration which at first sounds like rationing the amount you can watch 'Sea Quest.' But it's even worse than that. Sequestration is automatic spending cuts that both sides agree would trigger a new recession. It's like Congress put a gun to the economy's head and swore it will pull the trigger if Congress doesn't put its own gun down. It's kind of like a Mexican standoff without any Mexicans. Of course, Obama's answer to this budget crisis is to raise taxes on the wealthy just because he ran on that promise. And won the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what's really scaring me, folks. Republicans might let him do it, even though every Republican member in Congress has signed the no new taxes pledge created by the president of Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist. The two most terrifying words a Republican can hear other than 'buenos dias.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know, there is a state college in Northern California that has an interesting new program. The school is opening what they call the Humboldt State Institute for Inter-Disciplinary Marijuana Research.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;They plan-the plan is to organize lectures and research to study how marijuana relates to topics like economics, politics, psychology and sociology. They'll probably just end up playing ultimate Frisbee or something. ? I don't know if we need this. We already have a college research institute devoted to marijuana. It is called college.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Truthfully, Mitt Romney is going to meet president Obama at the White House tomorrow. They're going to talk things out.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people speculate Hillary Clinton ? it's not official. But she'll step down as Secretary of State.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I read tonight that Americans spent this holiday weekend $59 billion over four days. $59 billion. We spend over $15 billion a day. Almost breaking President Obama's record. That's amazing. Amazing!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about this? Do you know who is having lunch together tomorrow at the White House? The President and Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney and the President are meeting at the White House. They're going to sit down for what they call a near beer summit. See, he doesn't drink. This is part of President Obama's plan for less government spending. Invite someone to lunch who can actually afford to pick up the tab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials have exhumed the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's body to see if he died as a result of poisoning. They think Yasser Arafatm have been poisoned. I didn't know they sold organic Trader Joe's peanut butter in the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. President Obama is going to have lunch tomorrow with Mitt Romney. The Mitt Romney that he was against during the election. And you thought you had an awkward meal with your family on Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the President won re-election, he said he wanted to meet with Mr. Romney because he believes he has ideas that can be very helpful. It's a nice gesture, considering the fact that he hasn't let Joe Biden have lunch with him even once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't get. For the last eight months, Mitt Romney has been saying nobody should get a free lunch. Now, he's going to the White House to have a free lunch. You know, it doesn't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It was a tragic situation where American lives were lost and in the three months since the attack, legitimate questions of adequate embassy security, Americas overall advocacy in fighting the war on terror and the intricate dance between national security confidentiality and the public's right to know have all been distilled down, thrown out and replaced with this one urgent conclusion concerning current US Ambassador to United Nations Susan Rice.&quot; Sen. John McCain, Arizona: &quot;I will do everything in my power to black her from being the United States Secretary of State. She's not qualified.&quot; Stewart: &quot;That's Senator John McCain continuing his seven year quest to negate every good thing he'd ever done prior to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats are proving yet again they will do anything to push through their liberal agenda. Now they have gone a step too far. Senate Democrats with Harry Reid leading the charge want to drastically change the filibuster in order to limit the Republicans' ability to oppose certain legislation. Yes, Harry Reid is trying to stop Republicans from blocking certain legislation. For instance, any legislation. He's chipping away at the sacred senatorial institution known as the filibuster which allows the minority party to prevent a Bill from coming to a vote simply by speaking non-stop on the Senate floor. For instance, by reading the phone book. That's how, in 1974, the DC metro area yellow pages were signed into law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Harry Reid's doing this because he claims Republicans are abusing the filibuster?386 filibusters during Harry Reid's six years as Majority Leader. And given how little Congress works, some of that has to be Mitch McConnell stopping by Harry Reid's family dinner to block passage of the mashed potato.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you've been warned, Harry Reid! Take away Mitch McConnell's filibuster and he will strike back by obstructing everything you do! Or let him keep the filibuster so he can obstruct everything you do! I think the choice is clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know this. Today Mitt Romney had lunch with President Obama. It was an awkward moment when the bill came and Obama only offered to pay 47%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists have named a new species of fish after Bill Clinton that's a true story, yes. Earlier today Hillary Clinton caught the fish and had it deboned.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Obama and Mitt Romney had lunch together at the White House today. In fact, Romney offered to buy Obama lunch, but the President said, 'No, no, it's an on our grandchildren. They'll take care of it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a closed event. There was no press allowed. There were no cameras, there were no recordings to which Romney said, 'I'm not falling for that one again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was great they're having lunch together. Still, that's got to be awkward. I mean, kind of like having lunch with your ex, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, both men acted very graciously. In fact, I thought this was very nice. After lunch, Mitt Romney extended a return invitation for the President to visit him and his money in the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Obama met with a group of middle class Americans. He would have done it sooner but it took this long to find any. Yeah, there's not a whole lot out there. They're kind of, endangered species.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know something, the big topic continues to be the fiscal cliff. That's not a term anybody. It's like 'lavatory.' You go to the bathroom. But in school you go to the lavatory. Fiscal cliff is not a word normal people use. People don't relate to that. If you want people to understand use words people understand. Say, 'we're headed for broke ass mountain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, quick, off the top, you remember that contest the Obama campaign had? You donate and you might win lunch with the President? You are not going to believe who won! I can't believe it! Mitt Romney. The guy is just lucky! He probably barely donated much money at all but he still got?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, Obama couldn't have met the guy in a restaurant? Had to make him come to the White House? That's some cold brew. 'Hey, Romney, what's up, man? Hey, isn't funny you almost lived here? Yeah, this was almost your place. Three million votes, you know what I mean? Oh you worked so hard for seven years and you were just about to knock and go in and it said sorry?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, here is what happened. Two summers ago Congress realized that if they couldn't compromise on a deficit and revenue plan our economy would crash. Turns out they couldn't compromise. So here's what they did. In order to force themselves to work together and compromise they concocted a catastrophic penalty that would itself crash our economy. Brilliant! Put it another way. If there is an asteroid headed towards the earth. We made it and fired it at ourselves. Because otherwise we would never have done the hard work required to protect ourselves from the asteroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I love New York City. The Big Apple, the city that never sleeps, rat Xanadu. So I was crushed to learn the metropolis I know and love has changed, not one person was murdered in New York City on Monday. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Brown couldn't even remember the last time a day went by where not one person was shot, stabbed or slashed. What happened? ? This disturbing lack of violence is not just a problem for our city it is a problem for the Republican Party. In this last election they lost the blacks. They lost the women, they lost young voters. They lost Latinos by 44%. Even more surprising they failed it to get 100% of the white male vote. But there might be a way to turn the voter tide in the GOP's favor ? But as 'The Washington Post' Charles Lane recently wrote 'Fear of street crime once converted many a white working-class Democrat into a Republican. But safer streets have now blunted what was once a sharp wedge issue.' And folks, without crime the GOP's only remaining wedge issues are gay marriage, immigration, flag burning, voter fraud, welfare, gun control and of course contraception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the right is being punished for its own success. Like dentists who gave us fluoride don't have cavities to fill or my Teach A Man to Fish Seafood Restaurant. No one ever comes back. We have got to do something to scare white voters into voting Republican. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I am calling on all of America's disenfranchised minorities to violently rise up against the white male patriarchy that is keeping you down. It is time to stick it to the man. And I should know, I'm the man.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, all right. So the GOP proposal is adding up towards $1.2 trillion in cuts and a trillion in savings and they leave the tax rates alone for the top 2% and they - wait a minute. ? The fiscal cliff, the thing we're trying to avoid, had $1.2 trillion in cuts; half of those cuts were going to be to defense. This has $1.2 trillion in cuts but they're just saying why don't we make the whole thing cuts to entitlements and domestic spending and not cut defense at all? Basically they're trying to entice the Democrats. They're saying. 'I don't want you to fall off this cliff, so why don't you voluntarily jump off this steeper cliff?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it's been a month since the election, and thank God that's over. I mean, weren't we getting sick and tired of the election? I mean, from now on, the next time we have a presidential election, here's what we do. Whoever has the most money, you get it. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, they spotted Mitt Romney at the Cotsco again. Oh, my God. I mean, one day you're running for President of the United States, and the next day, you're shopping at Cotsco for giant jugs of mayonnaise. The guy had doomsday pepper. What is going on? And while you're at Cotsco, go ahead and return that oval rug you ordered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God Mitt Romney has a job. A lot of people were saying, 'Geez, what will Mitt do now?' I mean, you request only spend so much time with your money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news. He got a job at a Marriott hotel. Yup. President Obama's trying to stop us from going over the fiscal cliff. Mitt Romney is trying to stop people from stealing towels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that New York will hold a contest to redesign the city's payphones. Yeah. Top prize: a brand new walkman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today in Washington, President Obama met with leaders of the American Indian tribe. And they honored the President by giving him his own Indian name ? running deficit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Native Americans understandably very upset. This country used to belong to them. And, of course, now it belongs to the Chinese, so they are very furious about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama promised to help tackle the challenges facing the Native American community. And, of course, the biggest one, card counting. That is the biggest one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one really awkward moment in the middle of the meeting. Joe Biden walked in wearing a Redskins jersey. Yeah, that really caused some problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney is busy writing a book about his health. It's gonna focus on his recent heart transplant operation and his five previous heart attacks. It's called 'The Color Purple.' I believe that's the name of the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people said after the election what will Mitt Romney do. Because he's out of a job, didn't get the job he wanted and honestly you can only spend so much time with your money. So people were saying what will Mitt Romney. Guess what? He's got a job. He's working at a Marriott, ladies and gentlemen. He is the guy that comes out to the pool and tells the kids it to stop splashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of people have seen mitt shopping at Costco. Mitt Romney shopping at Costco. Well, you know, with the election over you can quit pretending to be a regular guy. But he loves shopping at Costco because he gets to use that express lane. 206 electoral votes or less and goes right through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think about it he can't blame Mitt for shopping at the big box, the discount stores, because he doesn't have a lot of money in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. South Carolina Jim DeMint is de-quitting. Now the decision on who will replace DeMint falls to South Carolina governor and friend of the show Nikki Haley. But who will she pick? Let's see, you want somebody young. Somebody conservative, somebody from South Carolina, maybe somebody who had a super PAC?Now folks I'm to the going to sit here and say I should be South Carolina's next senator. Not when so many other people are saying it for me. 'USA Today': Is Stephen Colbert Running For The US Senate? 'Huffington Post': Stephen Colbert For Senate. 'Roll Call': South Carolina For Stephen Colbert. 'New York Post': Are We Ready For Senator Colbert? Are we ready? Well, I get it. I get it. I know when I look at the US Senate I say to myself, you know what they could use? Another white guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama though, 'Forbes' has just ranked the President as the world's most powerful person. In response, Obama issued this statement, 'Suck it, Bieber.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as of 12:01 this morning, marijuana became legal in the state of Washington. That makes 19 states which have now legalized marijuana. Which, of course, raises the question, how the hell did Hostess go bankrupt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this? On CNN, they had a report. This is unbelievable. This new military technology that they say can make a soldier appear invisible. To which General Petraeus said, 'Oh, missed it by that much! Oh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Associated Press, China will soon overtake the United States as the world's number one global trader. Which is actually good news for most Americans. I mean, be honest. Didn't you think already China has taken over? Didn't you think they overtook us already? You know what that means? We're still number one for a couple weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gerald Wallace of the Brooklyn Nets has become the second player in the NBA to be fined $5,000 for flopping. You know about that, yeah. Fined for flopping. Good thing Mitt Romney is not in the NBA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hanukkah begins tomorrow. Or it begins in a couple of minutes, I guess, pretty much. Now for those of you that don't know, during Hanukkah, Jewish people celebrate the miracle when the oil in their lamb burned for eight days when there was only enough oil for one day. This tradition went on for years until the arrival of the three wise men, the heads of Exxon, Texaco, and British Petroleum. They put an end to that one day of oil lasting eight days thing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news, the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in nearly four years. Well the bad news, most of those jobs involve wearing a red suit, a beard, and having kids pee in your lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study at UCLA Latinos live longer than non-Latinos. More bad news for Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie stopped by the White House this week and met with President Obama on Thursday. Many believe Christie will run for President in 2016. Let me tell you something, if there is ever an office tailor made for Chris Christie it is the Oval Office. He would fit in there. He would slide in there perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, guys, some good news, some good news. The US unemployment rate is now the lowest it's been four years. Or as makers of sweatpants put it, 'Uh-oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has invited director Steven Spielberg to do a screening of his new movie 'Lincoln' right there on the Senate floor. Oh, yeah. That's a great idea, don't you think? Huh? Well, we've got huge unemployment. We're in the middle of an ongoing war. We're about to go off the fiscal cliff.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, Asians are immigrating to this country much more than any other minority group. And they assimilate very quickly. You know, considering the fact that, when they get here, most of them don't even speak Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that Pacquiao fight? He got knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez. What - in the 6th round? It was unbelievable. It was a great punch. Pacquiao hit the canvas face first. Just boom, went down just like that. Was that really that big a deal? Passing out face first in Vegas? Who hasn't done that, really? In Vegas, I mean, everybody's done that. Actually, Mitt Romney was there. Mitt Romney was at the fight and he met with Pacquiao right before they got in the ring. Now, Romney and Pacquiao have something in common. Both ended up getting knocked out by Latinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry announced he is taking steps to run for President, once again. He says he's seeking the presidency for three reasons. He can only remember the two of them, but he is seeking it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Mitt Romney - did you know this? Mitt Romney met Manny Pacquiao just before Pacquiao lost his boxing match to Juan Manuel Marquez. Afterwards Romney told Pacquiao, 'You lost for the same reason I did - young Hispanics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA has hired prison inmates to build satellite parts. That's a true story. Yeah. It's all part of NASA's new program to search for signs of life in the universe and then make them our bitch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night the National Menorah was lit near the White House to celebrate Hanukkah. Or as Joe Biden put it, 'Hey, it's Lumiere from 'Beauty and the Beast.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally today, McDonald's reported that it had better than expected sales in the month of November. Yeah. Exactly, they credit the success to increased advertising, new menu items and two states legalizing weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina Senator Jim Demint is stepping down, so guess who's stepping up as a possible candidate, Stephen Colbert. ? They love me in the Palmetto State because I love it. I love the beaches. I love the mountains. I love the beautiful old estates that have no negative historical connotation whatsoever. Of course not everybody is happy about my imminent appointment. For instance 'The Atlantic' called me vastly overqualified. And NBC.Com said 'Senator Stephen Colbert: Perhaps not as crazy as Senator Jim Demint.' What? I am at least as crazy as Jim Demint. He wanted to ban gay teachers from the classroom. I want to ban teachers from the classroom. With their knowledge agenda. I say let the free market decide what the atomic weight of carbon is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all the good people at Public Policy Polling, publicly policy polled South Carolinians today and found that of the possible replacements, I top South Carolina voter's wish list with 20% supporting me. Yeah. 20%, that's a half. Now my network contract prohibits me from taking on another full-time job, so the Senate would be perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now folks, since the brutal presidential election there has been a lot of soul-searching going on at Fox News. And I am confident that they eventually will find one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now while many people have called Fox News an organ of the Republican Party it was not Fox News's fault that Republicans lost. It was this guy. It was-- shoot, what's his name? I know don't help me, don't help me. Fox News chairman and goblin king Roger Ailes wanted somebody else as 'The Washington Post' recently reported, in the spring of 2011 Ailes asked a Fox News analyst headed to Afghanistan to pass on his thoughts to General David Petraeus, to resign from the military and run for President. And Ailes wasn't just encouraging Petraeus to run, he put a serious offer on the table. Which was secretly taped I assume, by Paula Broadwell hiding under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay so, if Petraeus ran for President, Murdoch would pay for it, Ailes would manage it, and Fox News would sell it though their audience. Now if you think about it, a news network choosing the candidate sounds like a conflict of interest. So don't think about it. Because it's not really about conflict of interest. Ailes said he did it because the Republican field needed to be shaken up. So it was really just worried about casting his reality show. As a TV producer Ailes was trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when Republicans nominated this cranky old guy. ? They couldn't save the John McCain show even by making his running mate Honey Boo Boo. Now unfortunately, Petraeus turned down Roger Ailes, I assume, to spend more time not making eye contact with his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed an amendment that officially legalized marijuana in the state. Stoners took a moment to thank Governor Hickenlooper. Then they spent a few hours just saying the word 'Hickenlooper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news. President Obama and John Boehner are still trying to reach a resolution in their fiscal cliff talks and it seems like neither side wants to budge on the issue. It's getting a little heated between President Obama and Speaker Boehner. Take a look at what they've been saying to each other. Yesterday, Obama said, quote, 'If we can get some leadership on the Republican side, we can probably solve this in about a week. It's not that tough.' Boehner then responded, saying, quote, 'I've sent the President our proposal. If he doesn't like our plan, he should come back with a plan of his own.' Obama responded to that saying, 'Maybe I will.' To which Boehner replied,[ mockingly] 'Maybe I will.' And Mr. Obama replied, 'Stop copying me!' To which Boehner replied, 'Stop copying me!' To which Obama replied, 'Whatever!' To which Boehner replied, 'Whatever times infinity!' To which Obama replied, 'Damn, infinity. You win for now, Boehner.' Very heated. Heated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, the phrase 'right to work' is such a positive and uplifting message. What could it possibly do to organizations like unions that also supports workers rights? The law probably strengthens unions. ? Or destroy the only leverage unions have to stay afloat, one or the other. So it's really a right to work around the union for the corporations. It's one of those things that are actually named for the opposite of the thing they do. Like strip bars call themselves gentlemen's clubs. Or the TV network dedicated to making us stupider is called The Learning Channel. Or a TV show that only airs four days a week calls itself 'The Daily Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's a special time of the year. We've been looking forward to it for months now. And wherever you go you can see the twinkle in little children's eyes because they know in a few short weeks the fiscal cliff is coming to town. Merry Cliffmas! ? And with a dramatic name like fiscal cliff, it's got to be exciting. OK, folks, I'll admit it. I don't want to talk about the fiscal cliff and you don't want to hear about it. For the next 20 days, all pundits are contractually obligated to talk budgetary policy and you the viewer are obligated to listen. Check your cable contract. It's right below the part where Comcast gets your kidneys. They'll be there to pick them up tomorrow between the hours of 9:00 a.m.; and 6:00 p.m. Wear something loose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is daring Republicans literally to blink. Well, the joke's on him! Because I know some Republicans who had their eyelids surgically removed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now critics say the Speaker is just asking Democrats to put specifics into the Republican proposal but I say that's kind of fun. It makes the budget into a giant Mad-Lib. For instance, we agree to cut ten bazillion from the program that gives ukuleles to the sticky poor. Toilet-boobs!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public Policy Polling, this is a company that spent a lot of time this year trying to predict which candidate would become President. Just released a new poll. They asked people which political party they think Santa belongs to. The poll revealed that 44% of Americans think Santa is a Democrat; 28% believe he is a Republican. And the other 28% said please stop bothering me with stupid questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people said 'Oh, Santa's a Democrat because he gives handouts.' And other people said he's a Republican because he's an old white guy. But the fact of the matter is Santa isn't a Democrat or a Republican. In fact, Santa isn't even an American. I have news for you. The real Santa is China. You think elves are the ones making that plastic crap we give our kids? No. Chinese people are. You want to see what Santa looks like? That's Santa. He's the premier of China. That's who you write the letter to, kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Department of Agriculture has announced it's changing restrictions on public school lunches to allow more meat. In September, they began limiting meat to try to combat childhood obesity, but the kids weren't getting enough to eat, so now the restrictions have been lifted. Basically what happened is the government told kids to eat their vegetables, the kids said no, and then the government gave in and bought them a hamburger, just like mom and dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Ten most fascinating ? and the show was on last night. Who do you think was number one, Paul?...General Petraeus. And I was thinking if this guy was a little less fascinating he'd probably still have his job.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know a little closer to home who else was on the Barbara Walters most fascinating, Governor Christie from New Jersey right across the river. Governor Christie. A lot of talk about maybe, hey, he wants to be president. And he was on the list last night. He was number 7 through 9.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean, are always making trouble up there am they launched a rocket there in North Korea. And he fired and was bragging about it and one time they fired a rocket and it just fell over. Remember when they fired the rocket. So over the weekend they fire another rocket and it goes up. I was thinking wait a minute, Kim Jung UN, the son of Kim Jung Il? every time he turns around he's firing a rocket and I said to myself, hey, you want to fire something, how about your tailor and your barber.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you realize Kim Jung UN is also a hobbit. He's the only world leader who is a hobbit. And oh, also, Mayor Bloomberg here in New York City is a hobbit.&quot; David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. &quot;Added two more engines to Air Force One?.still won't take off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now folks, you know me, you know I have had it up to here with this imperial presidency. The arrogance of getting re-elected by running on a platform that voters find appealing sickens me and now, and now folks, get ready for this, Lady Michelle Antoinette has abused her power yet again. Diane Sawyer, ABC News: &quot;Oh, the perks of being First Lady Michelle Obama is a self-professed Downton Abbey fan. She could not bear waiting until January 6th for the new season to begin so she asked the British filmmakers for a copy now.&quot; Colbert: Oh, yes, fetch me the Downtons. Now! Meanwhile we commoners are left to fear what will become of Downton as it lurches it into the roaring '20s. Will Lord Grantham accept Labbee Cybil's child with Branson? Will they stay in prison for the murder of his ex-wife? Will they accept a marriage proposal from a young corporal Hitler? So many questions! She knows the answers. But we don't. Until the season premier on January 6th.&quot; Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know marriage is under attack. So much so that our Congress passed a Defense of Marriage Act. And President Clinton signed it into law because it was the '90s and everything was ironic.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unbelievable show tonight. But first here's what people are talking about. The satellite that North Korea launched on Tuesday is apparently unstable and could collide with several American satellites, or as North Korea calls that ? the point.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HBO is planning a new movie similar to 'Game Change' but based on the 2012 election. The network said they are not sure who will play Mitt Romney and then Mitt Romney was like, 'Hey, I'm not doing anything.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the Senate floor was reserved for farewell speeches for retiring senators. Yeah. Each senator received a fitting gift. A gold watch that stopped working years ago.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's just so nice, so perfect. But while giving his retirement speech yesterday, Senator Joe Lieberman said that when he first joined the Senate, a blackberry was a fruit and tweeting was something birds did. That's funny. But it got annoying when he kept giving more examples for six more hours. He was like, 'going online was what you did at the supermarket. The web was what you found in the attic. Oh! Google is what you did when a pretty girl walked by! Whoa.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barbara Walters chose General David Petraeus as the most fascinating person of 2012. What a coincidence, so did Paula Broadwell.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And North Korea has successfully launched a long-range rocket. Well, good for them. You know, it's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't waste money on stupid things like food for your people.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like President Obama is going to pick John Kerry to be our next Secretary of State. This is a very strategic move when it comes to our foreign policy. Obama plans to use Kerry - see, he will bore our enemies to death. That's the way it works.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is kind of interesting. In an exclusive interview with Barbara Walters, President Obama said, 'Recreational uses of marijuana in states that have legalized the substance should not be a top priority of federal law enforcement officials.' He says he will not go after marijuana users in those states. Now he said, instead of Hawaii, he plans to spend Christmas in Denver and New Year's in Seattle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck once owned by President George Bush is going up for auction in a couple weeks. All the proceeds going to military families. I think that's wonderful. Actually, you know who should buy this truck? President Obama should buy this truck, because then when something goes wrong, he can blame it on Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And sources told ABC News today that the Undersecretary of Defense, a man named Michael Vickers gave sensitive inside information about the capture of Osama bin Laden to the producers of the movie 'Zero Dark Thirty,'.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about?my man, Chris Christie. He is mad. He is pissed off.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie also lashed out at Congress for doing nothing for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. But in their defense, Congress says, 'Hey, we don't do anything for anybody.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama signed the new fiscal cliff tax increase into law while vacationing in Hawaii today. He used this thing called an autopen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on this week. Congress approved some version of the fiscal tax bill, which raises taxes on the rich Americans.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little bit of history for you. The first US presidential election was held on this very day in 1789. And everything went smoothly. You know why? Florida didn't become part of the union until 1890.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Democrats said they want another trillion dollars in taxes. Trillion dollars. What? Didn't we just give them $620 billion last Wednesday? Is that gone already? I mean, who is running this, 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, the government is going to now mint - forgive me I just don't understand any of this - is going to mint a single coin, valued at $1 trillion. Honestly, if you can explain that to me you can have the damn show. It's all yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chuck Hagel is the new Secretary of Defense and I'm telling you Washington makes me crazy.

We have a new CIA Director whose name is John Brennan. This guy is already - well, you had John Brennan in the pool. Good for you. I'm telling you - don't kid yourself, that's not an easy gig, being Director of the CIA.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear Joe Biden and his wife left DC this weekend for a five-day vacation in the Caribbean.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin where we left off: Dangling tenuously on the precipice of the fiscal cliff. ? Let's get caught up on what this fiscal cliff is again. ? The fiscal cliff is the economic catastrophe that would occur with the simultaneous expiring of the Bush tax cuts and deep across-the-board spending cuts that Congress scheduled to kick in January 1st if Congress couldn't negotiate a fiscal solution by January 1st. Confused? Let me put it in terms of a 21st Century analogy that can crystallize the point of it. Pretend America is a successful railroad company that has fallen on some hard fiscal times. There's an argument within the company about whether to make some changes to the dining car offering, maybe cut fares for less wealthy riders, or, on the other side of the argument, where trains themselves are steel beasts that Stalin invented to kill freedom and Martha Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, before I went on break, all the news was about a looming economic cataclysm known as the fiscal cliff.

There's $20 trillion. Start counting now and call me around Labor Day and let me know how high - how close to $20 trillion you've gotten. We're $20 trillion in debt, so somebody at the Treasury Department says, 'You know what let's do? What we'll do is we'll print a coin for a trillion dollars. One coin, it will be worth a trillion dollars and we'll put it someplace so we'll always have that.' Somebody at the Treasury Department. ? But it is a collector's item. You can get ahold of it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the big upsets [in the nominations for the Academy Awards] was in the Best Director category. Everyone assumed Kathryn Bigelow would be nominated. She directed 'Zero Dark Thirty,' a very intense and amazing movie. But no women were nominated. The directing category looks like Obama's cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another thing I'm not happy about, folks: Obama's failed second term. It doesn't start for two weeks and it is a disaster. Point is, I gave it a chance. Even members of Obama's cabinet are jumping off the SS Barack like rats leaving for an opportunity in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't care if 43% of Obama's appointees have been women. They're not in this photo. I live by one rule: If I can't see it, it does not exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, Obama's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, is facing criticism because his signature - which will appear on the dollar bill - is completely illegible.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the inauguration is later this month. President Obama will be sworn in with his hand resting on two Bibles. Two Bibles.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for President Obama's inauguration, the Madison Hotel in Washington, DC - listen to this - is offering an inaugural town and country package. Two people. It includes four nights, a private car, a driver, a social media butler, and the cost is $47,000. Unfortunately, the only people that can afford to spend that kind of money voted for Romney.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

And then Newt Gingrich would come. And then he would go. And it was just awful. And now ten days from now, President Obama will be inaugurated. Ten days from now he will be inaugurated.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You sound like you all got your flu shots. Listen to this. According to the CDC, over 128 million flu vaccines have been administered this season; 128 million. That's almost as many injections as Lance Armstrong has gotten in his entire career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Associated Press, Lance Armstrong confessed during his interview with Oprah Winfrey that he did use performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times. This came as a complete shock to as many as a dozen people. You know, although he denied it for years, it was starting to become obvious. Like that one year he won the race on the stationary bike. Remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, reports say that Lance unburdened himself to Oprah and at one point it got very emotional and he began to cry. Let me tell you something, you don't mess with Oprah. If Lance thought the Tour de France was grueling, the Tour de Oprah, that is way tougher. You ever notice that? Everybody admits their secrets to Oprah. You know, Obama should make Oprah head of Homeland Security. We wouldn't have to waterboard anybody. Let Oprah interrogate them. And within 30 minutes, she'd have them crying. 'Yes, I'm a terrorist! My father never hugged me! I am a terrorist!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, the US Postal Service may now sue Lance Armstrong for the $30 million they gave him to support his team. You know what Lance should do? Forget the money. Lance should give the post office some of those performance-enhancing drugs and maybe we'll get our mail a little quicker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House has rejected an online petition to build a planet-destroying Death Star like the one in the movie 'Star Wars.' Well, an official said today that the Administration does not support blowing up planets. See, the White House believes the most effective way to destroy planets is with their economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of people, who signed up to buy tickets to the upcoming presidential inaugural ball, were left bitterly disappointed when they learned that all of the tickets had been sold before they were even available. So, let me get this straight. If we need more money in this country, we just print it. But if we need more tickets - you can't just start handing out tickets. This can cause huge problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Joe Biden has now been put in charge of the gun-control task force and he's cracking down. He's getting tough. In fact, the Vice President said today his first order of business will be to take the guns out of the hands of the last Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama, he's got a half-brother living in Kenya and the half-brother I think, is it Jerry van Obama? I'm not sure exactly that that's his name. But he's running for governor in Kenya. In Kenya. Listen to this, there's one problem. His opponents claim he was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Lance Armstrong Revelations:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Has given up on making the Baseball Hall of Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. United States Postal Service paid him in stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Started erotic website, 'Tour de Pants.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Admitted to doping just to get on 'Oprah'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey says she conducted an intense two-and-a-half hour interview with Lance Armstrong. Oprah says she never would have had the stamina if Lance wouldn't have given her something to keep going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama told Congress it must raise our debt limit because the US 'is not a deadbeat nation.' Then the President added, 'By the way, if China calls, I'm not here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart made a big announcement. Wal-Mart made plans to hire 100,000 US veterans, which can only mean one thing - Wal-Mart is going to invade Costco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about Oprah's interview with Lance Armstrong, where he finally admitted to doping. And get this. The interview supposedly lasted close to three hours. So, it's sort of like a regular interview, but, you know, on steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's inaugural parade will feature eight floats, including a Hawaii float to honor his birthplace, an Illinois float to honor the First Lady's home state, and a Kenyan float just to mess with Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, I heard the President will push for a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the US. Obama says it's all part of his plan to give every man, woman and child the chance to pay more taxes. And that's just the American way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news out of Washington. Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced that he will stay at the White House for President Obama's second term. He said his mission is to make the US number one in education and won't stop until our students are doing gooder. He won't stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that NASA just spent $18 million to add an extra room to the International Space Station. Could have been cheaper, but NASA's wife demanded granite countertops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believed in you Lance Armstrong! I shelled out a dollar for a rubber bracelet that I have somewhere in my house. For you! I did it for you. And when I think of the fact that I spent a dollar - well, I think we all owe cancer an apology. Or is that not the lesson in all this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lance Armstrong was doping. Of course he was doping. It was so obvious. You can beat testicular cancer and you can win the Tour de France, but you can't win the Tour de France seven times after beating testicular cancer. Or vice versa. Which would mean you won the Tour de France and then subsequently lost seven testicles. That can't happen either. Armstrong was doping. It seems so obvious in hindsight. It's like when you find out the tooth fairy isn't real for the first time and then you think about it and you're like, 'Of course, a winged fairy with no job spends her life collecting baby teeth, yet somehow always has money in her pocket to give out.' Defies credibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you can feel the energy in this room tonight, because there's one story rocking this nation. A bombshell dropped by my hero, Lance Armstrong, master of the two-wheeler. Rumors have been swirling for years about Lance, but unlike most Americans, when times got tough, I didn't get off the tandem bike of admiration. No! I saddled up, rang the bell of loyalty, put down the kickstand of support, stayed in it to Schwinn it, and - I've run out of bike metaphors. Point is, the man's a hero. He beat cancer. Then went on to beat something even less popular: The French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such a great day for Lance Armstrong. He admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. He confessed in front of the most respected judge in the land, Oprah Winfrey. Apparently, the interview went pretty well when Oprah told the studio audience, 'You get steroids, you get steroids, you all get steroids!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, during a routine cleanup, park crews discovered a cannon from the Revolutionary War that was still loaded. Old, loaded, ready to go. It's like me before the show. And they say the thing for a while was deadly dangerous and could blow up like that. But don't worry. New York City police did what they could. They put one of those orange cones by it. And then, then they found themselves a Revolutionary cannon-defusing, disarming expert team, squad that came in, and it took them a long time. They had to empty the powder. They had to take out the fuse. They had to get rid of the cannonball. And finally, after hours and hours of tedious disarm, the thing was absolutely safe. And immediately, the NRA was furious, furious!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know about the NRA. They're now saying they want all teachers to have guns, all teachers to have guns. But they still must use those scissors with the rounded safeties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody here got the flu, am I right? You all have the flu? I'm telling you. It's bad. They say everybody's going to get the flu. As a matter of fact, earlier today, I heard Lance Armstrong?I heard him admit to using Tamiflu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people, when the election was over and folks started yakking about the fiscal cliff, turned off the television set or threw it out the window? The fiscal cliff, does it have any bearing on your lives? Anybody here worried? No, and I'll tell you why. We don't know what it is. In my case, when you don't know what something is, you don't care about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Checking the web, here. President Obama signed 23 gun control measures today and called on Congress to ban assault weapons and 100 round magazines. There goes my fishing trip, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I swear to you, if I didn't know any better - and I'm not a big conspiracy guy - I would think the NRA is an elaborate avant-garde, Joaquin Phoenix-style joke or a false-flag operation run by Michael Moore in an attempt to discredit responsible gun owners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about this ? Oprah's big interview with Lance Armstrong is tomorrow night. It's a pretty big deal. Oprah said to get ready, she prepared 112 questions. Yeah. First question was, 'Did you use steroids?' The next 111 questions were, 'Oh, come on, you used steroids, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they're saying Lance may be forced to return the endorsement money he received from the US Postal Service. I mean, seriously? I'm pretty sure the only group that's lied more than Lance Armstrong is the US Postal Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Sunday, the White House will hold a private swearing-in ceremony for President Obama. Not to be outdone, on Sunday, Republicans will hold a private swearing-at ceremony for President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, they tried to interview one of the cyclists who did not take performance enhancing drugs, but they couldn't because he's still out there. He hasn't crossed the finish line yet. He's still ? he's still pedaling ? I think he's just coming over the Alps right about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said this week that he wants to find a pathway for citizenship for immigrants of the United States. Really? Don't we have that? It is called the Rio Grande River.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, thousands of dead fish have now washed up on shore along the coast of South Carolina. Today, the NRA said that this wouldn't have happened if those fish had had guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ann Romney, the lovely wife of Mitt Romney, has reportedly turned down a chance to appear on 'Dancing with the Stars.' Apparently, she has something called 'self-respect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said ? actually they did ask her. She says she loves to dance and is a big fan of the show. But she said she'd rather stay home with 'The Biggest Loser.' So, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, which is Martin Luther King Day, the presidential inauguration celebration [will take place] as Barack Obama begins his second term as President of the United States in Washington, DC. They'll have parades. They'll have entertainment. They have music from Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Queen Latifah. Movie stars like Kirsten Dunst, Alfre Woodard, Queen Latifah. A lot of Queen Latifah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President will be sworn in on Sunday by Chief Justice John Roberts. They have to do it on Sunday, because legally it has to take place on January 20th. But I have a feeling most people will be too focused on football and Honey Boo Boo to watch any of the inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, ladies and gentlemen, it's a big weekend coming up, and on Monday?President Barack Obama will become President Barack Obama again for the second time. It's the swearing in - the big inauguration, and listen to this: When they give the oath of office, he'll be sworn in on two Bibles. All right, we get it, you're not a Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, folks, pretty soon our sandwiches are going to be metric because America is finished. Yesterday, Obama shredded the Constitution and anointed himself King Gun Snatcher the Magnificent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President should focus on the strengthening the policies that we know are keeping us safe, like making sure nobody brings tweezers onto an airplane. Of course, Obama knew his gun-grab wasn't going to pass the smell test, so he stooped to surrounding himself with children. Like this confused boy, Joey. He loves trains. Folks, it was a transparent appeal to our humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why aren't kids writing the President about long-term restructuring of government debt. Come on Fox News youngsters, Benny, Roz, the rest of the Pinecrest retirement crew. Put down the Sunny D and fire up the Underwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully, folks, our Constitution has a built-in mechanism to stop democratically elected tyrants from taking our guns, and that brings us to tonight's word: 'United We Standoff.' President Obama and his anti-gun storm troopers say it's okay for me to have a pistol. It's okay for me to have a rifle and a shotgun. But it's not okay for me to have military-style weaponry. Maybe they've forgotten what the second amendment is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like anybody setting up a new government, the founders added a clause that said, 'If you don't like what we're doing, feel free to shoot us.' It's like?the Second Amendment is like the ultimate veto. It's almost like a constitutional prenup. That is why I and my friends at Fox News have always stood with those who arm themselves against government tyranny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But?today America has the world's greatest military, full of brave men and women armed with the most powerful weaponry ever devised. And it is because I respect our troops so much that I need a fully-automatic assault rifle with a 100-round magazine to kill them when they come for my guns. Because realistically?just think about this: You think that that AR-15 is going to save you when Uncle Sam comes knocking with an Apache helicopter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, now if the Second Amendment is truly to defend ourselves against government&quot; forces, &quot;then citizens will never be safe until we can have our own aircraft carriers. Now, I know what some out there are saying: 'Might some deranged individual take their constitutionally-guaranteed aircraft carrier to a mall, let's say, and rain Hellfire missiles down on a Cinnabon for skimping on the frosting?' Well, of course. There's no stopping that. But as Jefferson said, 'Sometimes the tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of the innocent.' Look it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Mr. King President, unless you and the anti-gun brigade will admit that we gun owners are constitutionally guaranteed the right to have any weapon we want, we will use every weapon we can get to keep every weapon we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the executive orders. That's what makes him a tyrant. Let's see what King Obama is bypassing Congress to do. Let me see. I have it right here. He has executive-ordered a launch of a national and safe responsible gun ownership campaign. He's ordered nomination of an ATF director, a launch on a dialog on mental health and, this is the one that appears to have caused the most controversy, the Centers of Disease Control to conduct research in the cause of gun violence and the ways to prevent it? Really? Tyranny? Because when I listen to that, that ain't (bleep) Hitler. I guess Hannity wants to protect American liberties and would stand up to any presidential overreach even if it was done in saving lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news. In a recent attack ad, the NRA claims that President Obama cares about his own children more than he cares about other children. In response, President Obama was like, 'Yeah, that's how families work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to wonder what's in the future for Lance Armstrong. It doesn't look good. The guy's a liar, cheat, a hypocrite, a fraud. Where is he going to find work? Okay, besides Congress. I mean, besides Congress, there are not a lot of options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to first lady, Michelle Obama - 49 years old today. Happy birthday. She told a reporter she'd like a nice gift from Barack, but nothing extravagant. Oh, don't worry. Obama is very responsible when he's spending his own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the usual sort of birthday party. They wheeled out a huge cake with ice cream and then Michelle yelled at everybody not to eat it. 'We have brussel sprouts, you know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study came out that shows that New York City is better at eliminating childhood obesity. Mostly because they force the fat kids to move out and become the governor of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of you may be surprised to see a Supreme Court Justice here. One, because she is a sitting Supreme Court Justice and two, because this afternoon she was in Washington administering the public oath of office to Vice President Biden. Doesn't it look like Biden just wants to high-five her? Probably the hardest part of swearing in Biden is explaining to him that you don't actually get to swear.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He [Obama] already took the oath yesterday at the White House! By taking it again today, Obama has made himself a three-term President serving the second two terms consecutively. Now to get rid of him we have to impeach him twice. Oh, clever girl. And besides, it's his second inaugural. Why the celebration? He's already President. You don't see the rest of America throwing a party when they continue to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll admit I was swept up four years ago. I was moved by the first black President. But come on, a second inaugural is like people who renew their wedding vows. We get it, you're married! I'm not buying you another salad bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then came the presidential pride parade, with eight floats from Obama and Biden's home states [of] Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, which honored Delaware by just driving through the parade on its way to somewhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm not going to do a critical deconstruction of Obama's partisan screed masquerading as an inaugural speech. Now is not the time to criticize. I will just say this: It was a clear call for a radical, collectivist agenda. ? Socialist overreach is coming. By February, we'll all be chained up in solar-powered asparagus gulags being force-fed birth control pills by illegal immigrants, who gay-marry us to endangered sea turtles. My advice: Find a good looking turtle-mate soon; you don't want to end up with a butter-beak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well nation, I will not sit idly by while Obama rubs our noses in the will of the electorate. So tonight, I am re-inaugurating myself as Commander-in-Opposing-the-Chief for an historic second term. Boys, roll out the Bibles! Brief historical note: These Bibles once belonged to Lincoln, Nebraska's Red Roof Inn. So, here we go. I, the Reverend Sir Dr. Stephen T. Mos Def Colbert, DFA, heavyweight champion of the world, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully reject this President of the United States. And will, to the best of my knowledge, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and ensure he's a one two-term President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to President Obama on his second inauguration yesterday. I thought he gave a terrific speech. He gave a great speech! You know, on the news they made a big deal out of the fact that four years ago, there were twice as many people at his first inauguration than there was at this one. Well, yeah. That's because four years ago, twice as many people could afford to stay in hotels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know who gave the shortest inauguration speech in history? George Washington. It was only like three minutes long. Well, sure. See, George Washington, he couldn't tell a lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Post Office may sue Lance Armstrong for all of the money they spent sponsoring his team. In fact, after all these lawsuits, they say that Lance Armstrong could end up as broke as the Post Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who checked out the inaugural ball last night? Did you watch that on TV? ? I don't know if you saw this at the inaugural ball, President Obama was caught doing some very stiff and awkward dance moves. Did you see that? Yeah. In other words, Obama is already reaching out to Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was all part and parcel of the pomp and circumstance of President Barack Obama's second inauguration. Yesterday's events had everything a true inaug-o-file would love. .. While the day celebrated Barack Obama, the breakout star was none other than New York State's senior Senator, Charles Schumer, who hosted the festivities and who was able to enhance the staged tradition of the ceremony with the exhilarating rhythm of post-Shabbat service announcements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course inauguration day isn't all ceremony. At its center, is the President's speech where he articulates the vision of governance in the next four years ? It's a call to action like JFK's 'Ask not what your country can do you,' or FDR, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,' or Jimmy Carter's somewhat inexplicable 'She's a brick house, she's mighty, mighty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still reeling from yesterday's inauguration disaster. First off, where was security? The Secret Service is supposed to protect the President and First Lady, but in the middle of a kiss, they were viciously photo-bombed. Enjoy Gitmo, Malia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the more I think about, the less impressed I am with Obama's speech. And it's not just me. It's everyone on Fox News. ? Yes, at his heart he is a socialist. Ever notice how it shares the blood with all the other organs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is Obama's inaugural speech was a swing and a miss, not just for what he did say, but for what he did not say. ? Yeah, where was the hopelessness? That's what the American public wants! I mean, who could forget FDR's famous inaugural when he proclaimed: 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and also a second depression, rampant starvation, and my gut's telling me Europe's a tinderbox. Ah, what's the point? We're all doomed! I can't walk! I can't walk!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, what are you going to do? We're looking at four more years of this guy, and thanks to Obamacare, we might live to see it. Where did we go wrong? The Republicans had everything going for them: A terrible economy, an unpopular incumbent, and a positive message for the American voter: Less than half of you are parasites. And still - still we lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with America's changing demographics, it only looks bleaker for Republicans in the future, unless science can find a way for Latino women to give birth to old white men. Where is the funding, Koch brothers?! Get on it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming. I appreciate that. I hope you had a good holiday weekend. It was an historic weekend for sure. More than a million people gathered in our nation's capital yesterday, and tens of millions more watched from home to celebrate the First Lady's new haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is funny that bangs are what most people talked about yesterday. It's interesting that Mrs. Obama chose inauguration weekend to unveil it. I have a theory as to why she did that. I'll give it to you in three words - giant forehead zit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the President gave a brief but powerful speech. He did not shy away from the many challenges he faces: a massive Federal deficit, a conservative majority in the House, an aging population, runaway entitlements, humongous ears. The list goes on and on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately following the inauguration, the President, his family and select guests were invited to a traditional luncheon at the Capitol. This is something they do. Speaker of the House John Boehner was seated next to the Obamas, and a camera caught a great moment. In this clip, you see Boehner saying something to the President, and he taps the First Lady. And then continued his conversation, and now watch her roll her eyes there. She's even acting like a girl with bangs now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big announcement for the American military today. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has decided to lift the ban on women in combat, which could potentially open more than 230,000 military positions previously unavailable to women. I think that's great. This is a sign that?we've really advanced as a nation. Now, women can fight for honor on the field of battle and on 'The Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the DEA says drug smugglers in Mexico are using cannons to shoot marijuana over into the US. They are! They have three distances, the cannons. Far, really far and Willie Nelson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if Beyonce lip-synced at Obama's inaugural, do you know what that means? If so, please write in, because I'd love to know why I'm so angry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This comes as a heartbreaking allegation, because we were all moved by Ms. Knowles' performance. None more so than Joe Biden?That man either loves this country very much, or Chuck Schumer just ripped one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people were led to believe she had delivered the most stirring rendition of our national anthem since Francis Scott Key first sang it at America's original Super Bowl - a cage fight between a bear and a China man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay. Let's break it down. Let's break this down. Now, here's the timeline. Late Monday, sources in the Marine Corps band, who allegedly accompanied Beyonce, leaked the information that 'Beyonce decided shortly before her performance to rely on the studio version rather than risk singing it live on the capitol.' Because evidently, this time, it was the jelly that was not ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then accusations start flying that the Marine Corps band 'wasn't actually playing during the song.' Oh, so now we can't trust the Marines?! What this does is undermine our faith in the military. Do we have a proper chain of command? Are we really even at war in Afghanistan? Or are we just lip-syncing to an old recording of Vietnam? Mr. President, Mr. President, the American people demand answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday, of course, was President Obama's inauguration. All the networks covered it, except for Fox. They ran their big 'Joanie loves Chachi' marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his inaugural address, President Obama praised the patriots of 1776, and said they were much better than the Patriots of last Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden?we love Joe Biden. He made another one of his famous gaffes on camera Monday, saying he was 'proud to be President of the United States.' I guess he forgot he wasn't at home standing in front of the bathroom mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a big story. Apparently, Beyonce did not sing the national anthem at the inauguration. She pretended to sing along to a prerecorded track. You know who caught her? Lance Armstrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for Lance Armstrong. There are now rumors going around that when he was sponsored by the US Postal Service, he shipped all his steroids and blood-doping materials UPS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steven Tyler defended Beyonce after she lip-synced at President Obama's inauguration. That's right. Steven Tyler said, 'I know how she feels. I did the same thing at Harry Truman's inauguration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up until now, the only thing that got the French angry enough to fight was serving a bordelaise sauce with fish. France is putting the hurt to Al Qaeda in Mali with planes, troops and its 'most sophisticated helicopter gunship,' which, in France, means a gunship that fires missiles at itself in a Dadaist commentary on the cruel farce that is war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bold military action even surprised the French, whose president, Fran?ois Hollande, is perceived as so indecisive and weak, he's earned the nickname 'flanby,' after a wobbly gelatin dessert.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interestingly, one of the reasons that Hollande is so unpopular in the first place is that he's the one pushing the gay marriage initiative. But as one paper put it, 'Mali could transform Hollande's political image.' Their wars make their leaders look tough, just like ours do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to take a minute right now to talk about the big story tonight: My anger and disappointment. It's been four months since the terror attack on our embassy in Benghazi, Libya. And every day since, the American people on Fox News have demanded that the American people demand answers. Well, yesterday we finally had their chance to hold Hillary Clinton's feet to the car on fire. And at hearings in the Senate and the House intelligence committees, congressional Republicans proved definitively that they suck at their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the hearings were a debacle that left unanswered the one question they were really about: Is there anything we can use to stop Hillary in 2016?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As each one of you in succession has pointed out, someone at State should have seen the cable from Benghazi, popped it upstairs to someone upstairs with more authority than State, and given those people at the consulate more security. That's a fair point that you don't have to all identically make. But you know, you ain't dealing with a rookie here guys. This ain't Clinton's first go-round at the finger-pointing rodeo. I mean, Clinton's like a finger-point Magneto. I mean, you come at her and she'll turn it around on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is this for quality? Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that women in all branches of the military will have the opportunity to serve on the front lines in battle. Panetta said he had no idea women could be such vicious fighters until he saw a couple episodes of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a scary moment at John Kerry's Secretary of State confirmation hearing. One of the senators had taken his Ambien the night before and combined with the stuffy room and Kerry's boring speech, he slipped into a coma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner said that President Obama's focus is to 'annihilate; the Republican Party. Do the Republicans look like they need help from President Obama? There doing a hell of a job themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton. Did you see her yesterday on television? Yesterday, she was grilled by congressmen on the attack in Benghazi. Then, out of habit, she grilled them about where they were last night and 'Who's this Megan?' Got ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon has decided to allow women to serve in combat. It's a true story, yeah. Yeah, the hope is that we can now finally defeat the Taliban by giving them the silent treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

As for the 'woman are too weak argument,' it would be a bad idea to send the 177th Linebacker Brigade to fight side-by-side with the Pixie Regiment, but to avoid that confusion maybe the military could have a requirement pertaining to physical fitness.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI is investigating New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez for allegedly soliciting Dominican prostitutes. So, once again, foreign workers doing the jobs Americans don't want to do, right? The FBI says Menendez agreed to pay the prostitutes $500, but then only gave them $100. So, he had sex like a Democrat, but was fiscally conservative like a Republican. That's what we need in Washington! We need more men like that! Yeah. A little different when they're spending their own money, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Sarah Palin has parted ways with Fox News. Network executives said she was unfair and unbalanced. Well, I guess Fox News realized she's a woman, she's not blonde, she's over 40. She had to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to reports from 'Psychological Science,' people eat more junk food and gain weight during tough economic times. Well, how ironic is that? I mean, the biggest obstacles in Michelle Obama's war on obesity is President Obama's economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is kind of cool. The NBA champion Miami Heat were guests of President Obama at the White House. Coincidentally, several members of the Lakers were there, too, but they were just seeking disaster-relief funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the wake of Colorado legalizing marijuana, lawmakers there are now having a tough time figuring out what the legal limit should be for those that are, you know, caught smoking while driving - if they're too high to drive. What's the legal limit? Here's a good standard, okay? If when you get pulled over and the cop tells you roll down your window and you order a cheeseburger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took questions on Facebook. Kind of cool. Then afterwards, Bill Clinton showed her how to erase her browser history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What separates conservatives from liberals is that conservatives think government is bad and people are good. Unless the people work in government, then they are bad. But they can leave government, go to a lobbying firm and become good again. It's a complicated theory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, the other threat to America is President Obama's recent 23-point executive order gun-control grab-o-rama. ? But this tyranny will not stand,&quot; and several states have introduced legislation &quot;that would make it illegal to enforce any of the new Federal gun control measures. ... That means if an agent of the Federal government tries to take your high-capacity magazine, just call 911 and say 'Police! Come quick! Someone's trying to enforce the law.' Then they'll send in a SWAT team to shoot themselves. Because these states know that there's a higher authority than some stupid law made by Washington clowns on Capitol Hill, and that's some stupid law made by local clowns in your state capitol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, each state picking and choosing which laws to obey finally realizes the vision of our forefathers. As Lincoln said, 'A house divided against itself-- sounds fun! What's the worst that could happen?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the Supreme Court is about to hear arguments about the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman. The act was signed into law in 1996 by Bill Clinton ? a man who understands being defensive about your marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama sat down for an interview with Telemundo to rally support for his immigration plan. Good. He told the Telemundo network that implementing immigration reform was the primary gooooal!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was kind of interesting. Zimbabwe's finance minister revealed yesterday during a press conference that his country ? the entire country ? has only $217 left in the government treasury. Today, President Obama said, 'Stop bragging.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama went to Las Vegas and spoke about his new immigration plan and...afterwards, was harshly criticized by the locals for speaking in English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Senate has overwhelmingly approved John Kerry as the next Secretary of State. Well, in his farewell speech today to the Senate, Kerry spoke for 51 minutes. 51 minutes. So, apparently he does believe in torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is the first white male to hold that job since 1997. So, finally middle-aged, white guys with gray hair are breaking through the glass ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Let's start with a couple, see how they go. The first one, the category is the 'biggest issue facing our country today.' Let's see what America thinks is the biggest issue facing our country today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, as President Obama is pushing for some new gun regulations, he's struggling to gain credibility from skeptical gun owners. In a recent interview with 'The New Republic' magazine, Obama mounted a frontal attack?This seems wrong on many levels. For starters, Obama appears to think the best place to reach out to gun owners is the pages of 'The New Republic.' A bit of a tell right there. It's like saying, 'I was telling 'Ms. Magazine' I love NASCAR and I have myself driven multiple Dodge Chargers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study released today, 65% of people say they would not date someone who is more than $5,000 in debt. Good thing President Obama got married before he got into office, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Daily News,' US Immigration agents who arrest undocumented aliens are sometimes rewarded with Home Depot gift cards as bonuses. They get a Home Depot gift card, which is not a bad idea. You go to Home Depot to make a purchase, and with the cash you get back, you can hire the day laborer you just arrested who's hanging around the parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Abbottabad, that's where Osama bin Laden was living for ten years with his seven or eight wives and his 40 kids. It was a huge complex just out side of Abbottabad and much bigger than any house in town and the locals thought maybe it was George Clooney living there. So Abbottabad has had some worldwide recognition. This is a true story. They're building a theme park in Abbottabad, Pakistan. ? Nobody's laughing at my timeshare now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Justice Department memo claims that President Obama has the right to order the assassination of an American anywhere in the world. Isn't that crazy? In a related story, Donald Trump has gone into hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea has released a propaganda video using the song, 'We Are the World.' yeah. At this rate, North Korea may have the technical knowledge to solve the Rubik's Cube.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news. Mitt Romney's son Tagg - he is denying reports that he will run for Senate this year saying the timing isn't right. Just like when his dad tries to clap along to a song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department announced that John Kerry, the newly appointed Secretary of State, will sign all official State Department tweets with his initials, J.K. You can see the confusion here. Because J.K. is also Internet slang for 'just kidding.' Let's just take a look at a few of his tweets. You'll see what I mean. Here's the first one, 'I'm thrilled and honored to uphold the position of Secretary of State, J.K.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pakistan is opening an amusement park and zoo. It's a zoo in the same town where the raid on Osama bin Laden took place. The zoo is pretty cool, but I heard you won't be able to see the SEALs until it's too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, to prevent a monopoly, the Department of Justice is trying to block Anheuser-Busch from buying Corona. So they did what everyone else does, they got their older brother to buy it for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, kind of a funny thing happened in this year's presidential election. Amidst the worst economy in decades, high unemployment and a steep spiritual decline, the country chose not a self-made and virtuous patriot to heal our woes but the same foreign-born socialist tyrant who created all of our woes. How did Republicans lose this eminently winnable presidential race? Messaging. If only people knew what the Republicans were about. What the Republicans need is some kind of 24-hours a day, seven days a week perpetual messaging refinement and distribution resource, preferably one close to the trappings of journalistic authority but without any ethical constraint. What would we call such a place? Elephant News is too obvious? Insane Clone Posse is already taken. Ferret! Ferret News!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks ever watch the Fox News?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans for Common Cents is a lobby group that 'aims to inform and educate policymakers, consumers, and the media about the penny's economic, cultural, and historical significance.' ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Americans for Common Cents backs everything up with science evidence, like a recent poll which showed that 'almost two-thirds of Americans still feel the penny should be retained.' And you can trust that poll, because it was conducted by leading opinion researchers Coinstar. Of course Coinstar, clearly impartial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Postal Service announced that it will stop delivering mail on Saturdays in an effort to save two billion dollars a year. Postal workers were shocked. They were like, 'We were supposed to deliver mail on Saturdays?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just revealed that the Federal Reserve was hacked on Sunday. That's pretty serious. In fact, they're saying the hackers could've made off with as much as negative $14 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that the Justice Department has concluded that the President can order drone strikes on American citizens. And today, Rush Limbaugh came out in favor of Obama-care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study released Monday by the Center for Economic Policy and Research says that working fewer hours can slow global warming. ... You know what that means? President Obama's economic policy is also his climate change policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is National Girl Scout Cookie Day, which is known as 'Obligated to Give Your Co-Workers Money Day.' How has Michelle Obama not put a stop to this already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans have their own line of clothing. Who knew that? ... I didn't. The problem is it keeps coming apart at the seams.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all know mayor Bloomberg? This guy is tough and he's on a campaign to make New York City a better place to live. Guess what he's done now? He's outlawing Styrofoam cups. ... He wants New York City to have the nation's toughest cup control laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Mayor may have gone nuts. We have a garbage problem. I don't know if you folks noticed the teeming steaming piles of giant garbage as you came into the theater. So the Mayor put together a garbage task force and here's what they deal to combat the giant garbage ? he's bringing in more rats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, 2016 will be here before we know it. That's why Republicans need to start searching for the perfect candidate now. Who will it be? Jeb Bush, half of Chris Christie, or do we track down that Zoltar machine so Bobby Jindal can make a wish to grow big?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, experience tells us that the best place to find a winning candidate is the state senate. Just two years before Barack Obama announced his presidential run, he was a lowly state senator, making state legislatures are the farm teams of American politics - which brings me to another installment of our sometimes-running series: 'Mr. Smith Goes to the State Legislature, Then Later, Possibly Washington.' First up, tonight Tennessee state senator and lost Weasley brother, Stacey Campfield. I first noticed Campfield when he demonstrated his knowledge of immunology by declaring that 'AIDS was caused by one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. It was an airline pilot if I recall.' Yes, and if I recall, it was shortly after that that airlines stopped serving free cocktails to monkeys in first class. Pilots couldn't resist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I've long-admired Campfield's heroic work protecting our students' morals with his 'don't say gay' bill, which proposed banning teachers from discussing homosexuality in school. Yes, if you don't talk about something, it goes away. For instance, Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course a reexamation of drone policy is not the only issue facing the Administration and our nation's military. In three weeks we face the next sequestration deadline, which means if Congress can't agree to a deficit reduction plan moving forward the automatic $85 billion across the board spending cuts that Congress put into place to force themselves to agree on a deficit reduction plan will take effect. Yeah it's as stupid as it sounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defense budget, we're not going to be ready to protect the country and defense spending cuts will have economic impacts as well. For instance, if the sequester kicks in not only will our international readiness be degraded. Things like the Blue Angels air show and Fleet Week will be canceled. No Fleet Week means no Cher music videos. No Cher music videos means shares of mesh thong body stockings take a big hit. That factory closes throwing dozens of lingerie workers off the job. Next thing you know we're back in a recession and forced to wear our underwear back on the inside. Devastating consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After passing a ban on large sugary sodas, mayor Bloomberg is considering a ban on Styrofoam cups. Seriously? At this point I'm starting to think 7-Eleven slept with his girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republicans have announced that Senator Marco Rubio will deliver the official GOP response to President Obama's state of the union address in both English and Spanish.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A second-grade boy in Denver suspended from school for pretending to throw an imaginary hand grenade at a bunch of imaginary monsters on the playground. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, President Obama gave his State of the Union Address. You know what I love? At every State of the Union Address, the President is always introduced by some guy who walks in and goes, 'Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States!' You know, if we're really serious about reducing the size of government, start with that guy, okay? I mean, what does he work - one day a year? You know, Joe Biden's got nothing to do. Let him introduce the President. We're already paying him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know why the White House scheduled the State of the Union Address for Lincoln's birthday today instead of Washington's Birthday? Well, it's because Washington was famous for saying, 'I cannot tell a lie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and for the first time ever...when the President walks into the chamber, instead of 'Hail to the Chief,' they played 'Hey, Big Spender.' I thought that was kind of interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched the State of the Union Address just for the commercials?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have got to hand it to President Obama. This is his first State of the Union Address in his second term and he is very - he is full of confidence, really kind of cocky and full of himself. At the end of his State of the Union Address, he showed America his Kenyan birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight at the State of the Union Address, the CEO of Apple and a NASA engineer both sat with Michelle Obama. Yep. The President said he hopes it sends a message to Americans that if you can't sit close to your wife, surround her with nerds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Nugent will attend the State of the Union tonight. Or as deer call it, 'The greatest night of their lives.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, tonight Barack Hussein Obama gets to give his annual 'Look at me, I'm the President' speech. ? Obama shouldn't even be up there giving the speech. 2012 was supposed to be the GOP's year. With the economy in shambles, they thought the race was theirs to lose. And they were right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's not just the presidency. The Republicans also lost seats in the Senate, lost the popular vote in the House. And briefly lost Paul Ryan in the mall. He was supposed to hold on to his mother's hand! They found him busting a union at the Build-a-Bear Workshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To plot their path back to power, the GOP recently held a three-day conference in Williamsburg, Virginia, which is the perfect location, because the Republican platform also re-enacts the 18th century. They say they went there for a little self-reflection. Exactly what men inspired by Ayn Rand need - more time thinking about themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They [the GOP] also reached out to voters with a web-survey asking how they can improve their messaging. And a computerized web survey is the perfect way to hear from Republicans' core constituency of the extremely old. The number one suggestion was, 'Hello? Hello? How does this thing make toast?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Republicans have got 2014 in the bag. Or they would, if not for political strategist and unlanced boil Karl Rove. You see, instead of joining his fellow Republicans in learning nothing from the last election, Karl has turned on them. Karl's bogus claim is that Tea Partiers cost Republicans winnable races by backing polarizing candidates, like Todd 'legitimate rape' Akin, and Richard 'somehow even worse on rape' Mourdock. Meanwhile, the manatee with the plan-atee wants the party to get behind the kind of mainstream, electable Republicans he's backed, like near-winner Connie Mack, strong runner-up Linda McMahon, and so-close-but-didn't-get-it George Allen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Tea Party isn't going to take Karl's new stab-you-in-the-back super PAC lying down. Tea Party activist Erick Erickson says, 'I dare say any candidate who gets this group's support should be targeted for destruction by the conservative movement.' That's right, Karl. You cross the Tea Party and you could end up like the last candidate they targeted for destruction - Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his fifth State of the Union Address tonight in Washington, DC. ... His focus was on jobs and the economy. He has an interesting plan to grow the economy. He laid it out. This is it. Cash 4 Gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately following the President's speech, Republicans gave their rebuttal, and this is strange. Yesterday, Democrats held a press conference to deliver a pre-rebuttal to the Republicans' rebuttal. Traditionally, immediately following the State of the Union Address, the opposition party rebuts what the President said. They don't know what the President is going to say, but they know they won't like it. But this year, the Democrats decided to preemptively rebut their rebuttal. So they gave a speech, responding to a speech no one had ever heard, which itself was in response to a speech no one had ever heard. Which I think is the plot to 'Inception,' isn't it? So God bless America, we're on the right track.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By 2016, won't America want a stooge back in the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys catch Marco Rubio's response to the State of the Union last night? Critics are saying that Rubio had a pretty tough time. At one point, he scratched an itch. Then, he seemed to wipe his mouth, and he actually reached over and took a sip from a tiny bottle of water. It wasn't good. By the end, I was waiting for him to pick his wedgie and butt dial his ex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the State of the Union Address last night, President Obama did an exploding fist bump with Republican Senator Mark Kirk. They did an exploding fist bump. Which really goes to show, you it doesn't matter if they're black or white, Republican or Democrat, politicians are really awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also gave House Speaker John Boehner a thumbs-up before the start of his address. Or as Boehner put it, 'Not the finger I usually get.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama proposed a college scorecard to make the college process easier on families. Not to be confused with my college scorecard, which just says, 'Held hands with a girl senior year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the SOTU Address] &quot;You were saying something about bridges? Shouldn't you have led with that one? Seventy thousand structurally deficient?

The bridges are death traps!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Fidel Handout here demanded a higher minimum wage, but said nothing about raising the maximum wage. For as long as I can remember, I've been stuck earning more than I can ever need.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, 70,000 structurally-deficient death traps [bridges]. On your way to your new minimum-wage job, you want to take the alternate route around the Mississippi River through Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama was just the opening act for the night's main event. The long-awaited Rubio address given by Florida Senator and board-certified minority Marco Rubio. ? No pressure Marco, you are just the egg from which the new Republican Party will be born, so we should put all our egg into one basket and then count our chicken before it hatches and while we're at it, why not make it a hand basket and take it someplace really warm?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made the annual State of the Union Address last night. The President told Congress and the American people that the state of the union is strong.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Florida Senator Marco Rubio rebutted for the GOP, and while the President focused on the middle class and said the rich should pay more taxes, Rubio said you can't have a middle class without the rich. He's right. Without an upper class to not be a part of, how would you even know you were middle class? You might think you were rich. That would screw everything up, so you need rich people to have a middle class. Just like you need biggie fries to have regular sized fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, you know if you watch this show, if you read the news, if you know what is going on in America, there's no denying that Barack Obama has been a failed president. As terrible as President Obama has been, his cabinet appointments have been worse. I mean, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood? Why? Because his name's got a car part in it? That's a low standard. What is next? Secretary of the Treasury Penny McNickel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he wants the new defense secretary to be former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel. Thankfully, today 15 Republican senators demanded the withdrawal of Hagel's nomination, and it's no wonder. Senate Republicans have found all sorts of shady associations in Hagel's past. For instance, he was once a Senate Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, according to conservative news aggregator Breitbart.com, Hagel may have taken money from an organization called 'Friends of Hamas.' 'Friends of Hamas'? That is serious! Being friends with a Muslim terrorist is a big commitment. You've got to be a groomsman in all four of their weddings. I mean, the suicide vest rentals alone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Friends of Hamas' is even worse than it sounds because this organization is so sinister that it doesn't even exist. Turns out, Hagel's link with 'Friends of Hamas' goes back to [New York] Daily News reporter Dan Friedman, who asked a Republican Senate aide looking for dirt in Hagel's past if Hagel had given a speech to the Junior League of Hezbollah or the 'Friends of Hamas,' assuming that no one could take seriously the idea that organizations with those names existed. Why wouldn't you take it seriously? I mean, if there's no Junior League of Hezbollah, who puts out the cookbook of bomb recipes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, the fact that these organizations don't exist only makes it more suspicious that Chuck Hagel has been tied to them. What else is he hiding that hasn't happened? Is he a member of the Al Qaeda Kidz Club? What about the Muslim Brotherhood? Or the Muslim Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants? And what about non-Islamic, non-existent groups? Has Chuck Hagel ever given a speech to Cobra? Or for that matter, Cobra Kai? Has he received donations from the Lollipop Guild? What are his ties to the Dead Poet's Society? And why are they dead? Did they know too much about Benghazi?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama you must withdraw Hagel's nomination or you will lose the support of moderate Republicans. Another group that doesn't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been discussing this week on the program how Republicans led by Senators Lindsey DuGraham and Salty McCain are holding up the nominees for the defense and CIA until the senators get the information on what happened in Benghazi, including who changed the talking points Susan Rice used on the Sunday morning shows, so we can be sure going forward that no Americans are harmed again by the talking points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Pakistan are complaining that the movie 'Zero Dark Thirty' contains a lot of errors about the country. They were like, 'The movie makes Pakistan out to be a hellish wasteland of corruption and intolerance, but in real life it is way worse than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Gallup poll, 70% believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. The other 30% are so disillusioned, they're thinking about moving back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the US Postal Service has announced they're going to be selling their own line of post office clothing. Postal clothing. It's for people who always want to arrive late and not work on Saturdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month, Mitt Romney will be making his first public speech after losing the election. ... His topic will be rebuilding your life with just a hope, a dream, and $230 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think a fashion line is a bad idea, but I think if the post office gets behind something, it'll eventually turn out to be a good idea. Just look at sponsoring Lance Armstrong, for example.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now - Starbucks has caught themselves in a bit of a controversy after anti-gun advocates tried to organize a boycott after the Starbucks chain said the company would follow the local gun laws where their stores were located. The company stressed that their position does not mean they are pro-gun. And believe me, I think Starbucks learned years ago you don't need a gun to rob people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First it was the fiscal cliff. ... Then that disappeared, then it was the debt ceiling. Holy God, the debt ceiling crisis. I can't tell you how many times I rounded up the family and the dog and headed for the bunker. ? Now, we're being sequestered. Sequestering. Anybody ever heard of that term in that context? I have no idea what it means. The budget goes into effect on Friday, which means it will affect - oh, that's it, airport security. Airport security. They're cutting back on airport security. What has kept us safe? Airport security. What are they cutting back on? Airport security. I mean, now we have to go back to patting ourselves down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night the Oscars took top achievement in chapping my hide. Last night there were hit and misses on the red carpet. ? As for the awards themselves, I don't know what to say. .. When it came time for the Best Picture, the big award, was it presented by a movie star? No - it was presented by First Lady Michelle Obama, followed by a pile of wrinkled laundry. Oh, and did Mrs. Obama give it to the most American movie, 'Zero Dark Thirty'? No. Wouldn't want to honor the movie that killed bin Laden. Her husband has to get all the credit for that. We all know Hollywood doesn't reward torture films, because if they did, the winner would have been 'Battleship.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just beginning. Next summer, the movie will be Harry Reid driving the speed limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the media, a smoking gun is always a smoking gun. Some journalists are so prejudiced against guns they've sunk to journalism. Because there's no national database of shootings, Slate has started tallying the number of gun deaths since Newtown. It's been more than 30 a day. I know that number sounds high, but there's only 28 days in February, remember. Sadly, all this anti-gun information has had an effect: In a recent poll, 93% of Americans favor background checks. We can't trust those 93%. We don't know their background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't the first time our Second Amendment rights have been threatened by fact. In 1993, the jack-booted statisticians at the Centers for Disease Control published a study of gun households. Now, according to the study, not only were guns ineffective in home protection, but people who kept guns in their homes appeared to be at greatest risk of homicide than people who do not. Sure, with a gun in my house my family is less safe, but isn't that a small price to pay for my family's safety?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a White House briefing, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned that sequestration would affect border security. Her remarks raised eyebrows in Washington and got big laughs in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand this whole sequestration thing that's going on in DC? Sequestration. Doesn't it sound like some kind of side effect from a bad medicine?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. Remember he got in trouble for allegedly cavorting with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic? Well, now, a professional East Coast escort has come forward, and she says she had a sexual arrangement with him and other politicians as well.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, if there's one thing the reelection of Barack Obama proved, it's that demographic shifts are making it harder for the GOP to win nationally.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Team Obama's former National Field Director Jeremy Bird, one of the masterminds behind the President's reelection victory, has decided his next job will be turning Texas blue with a new grassroots organization - Battleground Texas. ?

They found 100 bags of heroin in his butt. That's right, they pulled a guy over for a routine traffic stop. He had some outstanding traffic warrants. So they took him to the station and that's when he found out he was a human pi?ata. So they took one down and passed it around. And there were 99 bags of heroin. And so on. He was charged with possession of heroin with intent to sell and tampering with evidence. I say if you have 100 bags of anything in your butt, you should be allowed to keep it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first, after the election, there was the fiscal cliff. Do you remember the fiscal cliff? They tried to scare the crap out of us about the fiscal cliff, didn't they? Did anybody here understand what the fiscal cliff was? That goes away, what was next? The debt ceiling. Oh, my God! The debt ceiling. Is the debt ceiling worse than the fiscal cliff? Yes, much worse. Okay, that went away, and now sequesters. Sequesters. Any idea what those are? Who was the star of 'Rocky?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I know is this means a lot of government cuts.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In today's vote in Italy, not a single party won the majority. So, Italy's next prime minister will either be Silvio Berlusconi, who's the Italian Bill Clinton,&quot; and &quot;then there's a communist and then there's a stand-up comedian. It sounds like a set-up to a joke. Italian Bill Clinton and a comedian and a communist walk into a bar. And the bartender says 'Hey, it's Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I think would be a great prime minister of the US? Yakov Smirnoff. But Craig, you say, Yakov Smirnoff wasn't born in America. Didn't stop Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, we're still fighting the war on terror,&quot; and &quot;the war on terror just turned 12 years old, which explains why it's so into remote-controlled planes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my favorite thing about our endless, borderless war against an emotional state is our prison at Guantanamo Bay. Even though many have wanted to see Gitmo closed, including President Obama, despite all logic, it remains open for business. It's the Radio Shack of the war on terror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you follow the news closely, you are probably unaware that Gitmo is currently hosting the trial of 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. ... Now, one reason you may not have heard about it, is that not the easiest trial to cover. First, because it's not really a trial. It's a one-of-a-kind military tribunal designed by President Bush, implemented by President Obama, and inspired by President Kafka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, reporters are not allowed in the courtroom. They have to watch the trial from behind 'soundproofed glass and hear the proceedings on a 40-second delay.' And to protect national security, the judge, or a security officer in the courtroom, can hit a mute button which shuts off the audio to the reporters and indicates this by making a red light on the judge's bench spin. The red light also indicates that all dress shirts and men's slacks are 20% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on January 29th, the red light turned on and cut the audio, but ? and this is the fun part ? neither the judge, nor the security officer had done it, causing the livid and confused judge to say, quote, 'Note for the record, that the 40-second delay was initiated not by me. If some external body is turning things off, if someone is turning the commissions off under their own view of what things ought to be, with no reason or explanation, then we are going to have a little meeting about who turns that light on or off.' And while you're at it, find out who put the dimmer switch on habeas corpus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the government's prosecutor said she could explain who was doing it, but not in open session. ... Well, whoever's doing it, it's got the defense lawyers worried that someone might be listening to private communications between them and their clients at the defense table. C'mon, I realize these military tribunals are a little unconventional, in that they may not be covered under the Geneva conventions, but it's paranoid to imagine that the government is eavesdropping on you at the defense table. They're eavesdropping on your attorney-client meeting rooms. Hey, they say justice is blind, but they never said she's deaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, so the whole thing's being spied on and controlled by unseen forces. Big deal. It's just like 'Survivor,' except in this case, no one gets voted off the island. But folks, I can understand that for many this trial has lost its legitimacy. So, I say we do the ethical thing and let the detainees go free. Then hunt them down with unaccountable flying death bots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this month John Kerry was sworn in as Secretary of State, an announcement that was met with a resounding, 'Yeah, okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Sunday, he embarked on a ten-day, nine-nation marathon that I was surprised to see did not include his homeland of Easter Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not good, you guys. Americans are bracing for this thing called the sequester. ? It's like when $85 billion will be cut from almost every part of the budget. So, teachers, meat inspectors and TSA workers will all be affected.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At &quot;midnight tonight a ticking time bomb goes off in Washington, and for once I'm not confusing real life with an episode of 'Homeland.' The horrific scenario awaiting us is sequestration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama &quot;is trying to convince us the sequester is a terrible problem, when, in fact, it's a terrible solution. You see, it was born back in 2011 when Obama wanted to raise the debt ceiling, the amount that America can borrow to pay its bills. It's sort of like raising the credit limit on your Visa to pay off your MasterCard if you had used your MasterCard to pay for two trillion-dollar wars. They were worth it, because now we can use all the free miles to go to the next war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Republicans would only raise the debt ceiling if the President promised later spending cuts. If those were not passed by an arbitrary date, it would trigger the sequester, a doomsday scenario designed to cripple programs that both sides love. The Democrats would see damaging reductions in education, national parks, vaccination programs, food inspection, even the National Zoo, while Republicans would see cuts to everything they hold dear, like the military?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the two sides failed to come to a compromise...March, 2013, would come in like a lion and go out like a lion loose from the unguarded National Zoo. It was a good plan, as long as one of the sides didn't forget that it was a horrible plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in retrospect, we should have seen this sequester failure coming. It's just like the story from the Bible: 'And lo King Salomon said, &quot;If I cannot agree whose baby this is, I shall cut it in half.&quot; And one of the mom's said, &quot;Great, half a baby. Probably less work anyway, if you get the top half. No diaper changes.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, I think I know why the sequester is not working, because it doesn't affect Congress. The salaries of senators and representatives do not get cut. So, to Congress, the sequester is like a loan shark saying that if you don't pay up, he's going to break your neighbor's legs. No skin off their nose. Also, he'll be taking your neighbor's nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that doesn't mean the sequester itself was a bad idea. Remember, the government that governs best is one that forces itself to either make tough decisions or suffer unimaginably horrible consequences. I believe it was Jefferson who said that, or Jigsaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, to prevent the next crisis, we just need a worst scenario. I say we suspend a monkey above the floor of Congress. No, an Ebola monkey. Then, every senator in Congress...gets smeared with bananas and a meat. If they do not reach a budget deal by the deadline, the doors to Congress are locked, the rope is cut and it is meal time in the monkey house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Senate confirmed Jack Lew to be President Obama's new Treasury Secretary. Unfortunately, if the sequester happens, he'll have to be let go due to budget cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, with automatic spending cuts scheduled for tomorrow, 300 illegal immigrants have been released from jail in Arizona. Or as officials put it, 'Catch you later.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Senate failed to pass both Republican and Democratic alternatives to head off these across-the-board spending cuts. It was pretty scary, you know? I mean, for a second there, Congress was dangerously close to actually getting something done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Kind of, sort of implied that hypothetically, in the right?'Yes, we can do that, probably won't, but yes.' So, Senator Rand Paul, to draw attention to the issue of the execution of executive executions, executed the classical filibuster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't say I agree with Rand Paul about everything, but as issues go, drone oversight is one worth kicking up a fuss for. But Rand Paul's filibuster preventing the Senate from getting anything done on John Brennan's confirmation is really just a distraction from Congress' inability to not get anything done on the sequester. Yes, Congress, where you rarely see so many things going nowhere so noisily, outside of a NASCAR race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those Head Start skeptics are referring to a piece of 2012 Health and Human Services Department study that showed that while kids who went to Head Start did better for the next few years than those who didn't have the program, by third grade, results evened out. Which might leave a normal person to say why don't we take the beneficial Head Start techniques and apply them to the third grade to keep things getting better, as opposed to the counterargument that the benefits of the program only lasts a few years, so [bleep].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if we're going with studies, you could keep reading the same report you're quoting from and see that other studies have shown that, in general, Head Start programs boost graduation rates, lower crime rates, increased college attendance, income, and they correlate with lower mortality rates for children ages five-to-nine. Oh really, who wants to get to double digits? I mean, your body just goes to hell after nine anyways.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has a new crusade. He wants people to stop listening to loud music in their headphones, which...wasn't that the plot of 'Footloose'? As you may know, over the past few years Bloomberg has banned smoking in public, transfats and sodas larger than 16 ounces in the city of New York. Now, he wants people to stop listening to loud music. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, but the last time I checked, Mike Bloomberg is only a mayor. My headphones are named by a doctor named Dre, and I don't recall asking for a second opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg must throw the worst parties ever. How long before he just starts showing up on street corners and whacking the hot dogs out of people's hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Rodman was in North Korea last week, where he spent some quality time with the supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un - the leader of the country that this morning promised to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against us ? I know this sounds like a bad movie plot, but we might need Donald Trump to fire Dennis Rodman from 'Celebrity Apprentice' so he can save us from obliteration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Rodman's publicist said he wants to go back to North Korea sometime in the next six months and he wants to use his new friendship with Kim Jong Un to help broker peace between the United States and North Korea. Maybe we should let him try it. We already let our smartest people try to work out a peace agreement. Why not let our dumbest person take a crack at it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a great day for the White House. All tours of the White House have been canceled due to budget concerns. ... Don't worry, there's another way get into the White House if you don't belong. Fake your birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, there's a comet. Look at this headline: 'A Comet Making the Closest Approach Ever to Earth.' Now, is it really a comet? Or is it one of President Obama's drones? You're welcome, Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, los Koreans del Norte threatened to end the 60-year cease-fire with South Korea and you know they mean business. They already wiped East and West Korea off the map.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, with tensions rising, America had no choice but to send their top negotiator, Dennis Rodman, for some basketball diplomacy. After all, basketball diplomacy worked at the Yalta Conference. Stalin backed down pretty quick after getting tomahawk-dunked on by FDR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, North Korea is willing to go to any lengths for the world to honor it's demands. ... 'Oh please pay attention to us. I can do a cannon ball, look!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, you know yesterday, Senator Rand Paul embarked on a filibuster to draw attention to the issue of [the] executive branch's seemingly unchecked power to use drones on American soil. The libertarian senator spoke for 12 hours, fortified only by the occasional nougat-filled government handout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, this is nice, he took a group of Republicans for dinner at a restaurant last night. And at the end of the meal, the President personally picked up the tab. ... Afterwards, Republicans said, 'Typical Democrat - spend, spend, spend.' What is wrong with them? He picked up the tab. Took them to a nice Chinese restaurant. I actually don't know what kind of restaurant they went to. ... I thought it was Chinese, because we owe all the money to them. It's a way to make it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea has threatened to nuke the United States. ... Which begs the question, what the hell did Dennis Rodman say over there? Seriously. I don't know what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Venezuela, they held the funeral for dictator Hugo Chavez. Many world leaders were there. Iran sent their president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Cuba sent Raoul Castro. We sent Dennis Rodman. So, it worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that Hugo Chavez is gone, of course, the crazy, nut-ball dictator-void will be filled by North Korea's Kim Jong Un. So, it's nice of him to step in and fill that. We appreciate that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's half brother, Malik Obama, is running for governor in Kenya. And unfortunately, his political opponents are now spreading the rumor that he was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new poll indicates that President Obama is no better than George Bush at protecting civil liberties. In fact, the pollster had some follow-up questions, but split when he saw the drone fly overhead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has nominated Wal-Mart Foundation president Sylvia Matthews Burwell to be his next budget director. And she's a good fit, 'cause Wal-Mart is also heavily dependent on China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge has overturned New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ban on large sugary drinks. Well, that's great, isn't it? I mean, our government can't come to agreement on the sequestration, but when it comes to real issues like our soda, the rulings are swift and decisive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, when it comes to this whole stupid sequestration thing, Mayor Bloomberg told people not to panic. He said, 'We're not going to run out of money.' You know, I'm no financial expert, but when you're $16.5 trillion in debt, haven't you already run out of money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas here in California is just about $5 a gallon. Unbelievable. In fact, oil company executives are now considered so evil that Dennis Rodman won't even have dinner with them. Gas is so expensive, Rachel Maddow is now carpooling with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did anybody have to go through airport security to get here? I like it when they frisk you. I'll be honest. When they pat you down and - are you like - do you have such a fragile ego that if you weren't patted down you would take it personally? ? Well, anyway, now you can...take pocket knives on commercial flights. Pocket knives on commercial airlines. What could possibly go wrong? What could possibly go wrong? If you're like me - I like to spend a lot of free time at the airport whittling. And you can also take pool cues on commercial flights. So pocket knives and pool cues. This is great news if you're a knife-wielding pool hustler. You're back in business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me begin by saying Happy Passover, if there's anyone here who is of the Jewish faith. Last night...President Obama celebrated Passover by hosting a Seder at the White House. There was an awkward moment when Sasha asked, 'Hey, I thought we were Muslim?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's still talking about March Madness, and it turns out that President Obama has correctly predicted 11 of the Sweet 16 teams. When Joe Biden was asked about his Sweet 16, he said, 'It was great. I had a petting zoo and a clown.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 100-page report to reassure Republicans they don't need to change what they are saying, but how they are saying it. 'Remember, when you tell a gay person that their love is too unnatural for society to recognize - smile.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big issue for 2012 was to connect with minorities. Please welcome GOP 2.0, relatable style. ? After pretending minorities didn't exist, the Republican Party has decided to physically go into the areas and engage person-to-person, or as that is known on the streets, talking. ? They will go to minority neighborhoods, conduct market research and take people back to the minority communities with a re-targeted message. It works for Kool Cigarettes. Why not for another organization that has seemed indifferent to the overall health of minorities?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I don't need to tell you that the Republican Party is in crisis. And ever since they lost the election, the GOP has been flailing around for answers. And no one has flailed harder than Republican National Committee Chairman and unsolved jumble puzzle, Reince Priebus. Crisp bee urine. Look it up. ... Right after the election, Mr. Urine convened a panel of Republican leaders called the 'Growth and Opportunity Project' to study why they lost. Or, as he put it,... a full 'autopsy.' It's the natural thing to do when you've got candidates this cold and stiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the autopsy says that Republicans need to do a better job of reaching out to black people, brown people, and women people, no group is more important to the GOP's future success than young-people people. As the report laments, Mitt Romney lost voters younger than 30 by five million votes. Five million! What were my fellow under-30-year olds thinking? ? The autopsy says that to reach the kids, the GOP should establish a Republican celebrity task force, an elite squad of conservative superstars ready to deploy as soon as we activate the celebrity task force signal. GOP celebrity task force assemble! Jon Voight! Victoria Jackson! Tom Selleck! Kelsey Grammer! Cliff Claven! Lady from 'Northern Exposure,' At least one Baldwin! The kids won't know what hit them, because I'm not sure they know who these people are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big day at the White House when President Obama named the first woman to be the director of the Secret Service today. Experts are calling the move an important part of history ? sorry, I meant her-story. You could tell she's good, because one official was like, 'I've never seen a female Secret Service agent before.' And she was like, 'Exactly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday, former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for having an affair with his biographer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Texas Governor Rick Perry made it clear that he is against same-sex marriage. He said the issue is not debatable. And if it was, he'd lose, because he loses every debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the University of Southern California...the former general and CIA director David Petraeus made his first public speech since resigning in November over that extra-marital affair.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Mexico Representative Steve Pearce is proposing a rule change that would allow lawmakers to telecommute to Washington and pass laws without meeting face to face. ... It would be a virtual Congress, where the House of Representatives would be able to video conference from home. The breakthrough? This would allow congressmen to vote on laws while actually being in bed with the lobbyists at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And commenting on Prince Harry's upcoming visit to his state, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he will spend the entire day with Prince Harry, and he's going to make sure nobody gets naked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea now threatening the United States with all-out war. You can see they're stepping it up. In fact, they released ten more photos of Kim Jong-Un looking through binoculars. Do you know the city of Los Angeles is apparently one of Korea's top targets? Could they possibly do any more damage to this town than Lindsay Lohan driving a Lexus?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of North Korea, they are isolated. They are so isolated, they just sent a wedding present to Larry King and his first wife. That's how isolated they are. They are so isolated, their Olive Garden has limited breadsticks, okay? They are so isolated, they're hoping this year Wilt Chamberlain will lead the Lakers to victory.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like the April Fools jokes, do you like the April Fools jokes?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, they have the big Easter egg roll, the Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn in Washington and - I don't know. I mean - first of all, it's the day after. And Michelle Obama is all about eating healthy, so this year they hid only the egg whites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, when you're the President and you're living in the White House something always goes wrong. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Florida Senator Marco Rubio? He's now saying that he supports immigration law&quot; reform. &quot;To have this guy in that position is important. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is getting ready to unveil his new budget nine weeks after its original due date. Or as his dog Bo put it, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. I ate the first draft. I know the drill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, a group of priests, ministers and rabbis are calling on President Obama to stop the White House drone program. The priests, ministers and rabbis weren't planning on working together, but they happened to walk into the same bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, every day more and more freeloaders are sucking at the government teat. Which is especially troubling since Uncle Sam is a dude. That's not even counting Obamacare, which takes effect in less than eight months. Do you realize what this means? If you go to the emergency room now, you'll be covered by the time you finally see a doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare raises eligibility for Medicaid to 133% of the poverty line, allowing it to cover 30 million more Americans by 2022. Thirty million medical moochers. To put that in perspective, if you laid them all end-to-end, they would stretch to Canada, which is where they should move if they want free healthcare!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Republicans have done their part. They have voted to repeal Obamacare 39 times. One more and they get free healthcare for life. Just kidding. They get that now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's Obama's trap. The feds are picking up 100% of the cost of each state's Medicaid expansion until 2017. But then, over the next four years, the percentage the feds pay plunges all the way down to 90% By then, your state is hooked like a diabetic jonesing for his insulin fix. ... Luckily, Republican governors aren't falling for it, like Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam. Under Obamacare, 180,000 people from Tennessee would be added to his state's Medicaid or Tenncare program, but Haslam said no, explaining, 'A lot of people say, &quot;Hey, that's an easy call. Just expand three years 100% and then walk away at that point in time.&quot; I don't think you can easily walk away.' No. Do you know how heartbreaking it is to tell someone they're no longer getting healthcare? It's so much kinder to just tell them they're never getting healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, the governor is confident that Tennessee can go it alone, because Tennessee already has a great plan for getting affordable healthcare to the those who need it: A healthcare lottery. Twice a year, residents who have high medical bills and who wouldn't be eligible for Tenncare can call a state phone line and request an application, but they need to do it quick, because the line shuts down after 2,500 calls - typically within an hour. Yes, for one hour, twice a year, a few lucky people are allowed to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, since the line is only open for an hour, would-be applicants are encouraged to use multiple phones, and to dial and dial and dial. Yes, keep calling! And if you do get through, make sure you shout 'Tennessee Tenncare has all the healthcare hits!' And you'll win two tickets to see your dermatologist live at the Bourbon Blues and Boogie Bar! Nation, I love this healthcare lottery. It finally adds some suspense to that old, boring question: 'Will I see tomorrow?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House held their 135th annual Easter Egg Roll. It sounds like fun if there are no fun things to do. President Obama and Mrs. Obama were there to make sure none of the kids got candy. The theme was 'Be healthy, be active, be you.' That's the problem. There is nothing healthy or active about me. But that was the theme. They had a yoga garden, which sounds like a place you threaten kids with when they are bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top Iranian official has announced that 2013 will be the fall of the American empire. Let me tell you something, okay?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of a bold, new initiative, today, President Obama asked Congress for $100 million to map the human brain. And believe me, believe me, if anybody needs a map to find their brain, it's Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they did yesterday in - and I think this was privately funded so don't get excited about them spending our tax money. They had the big annual White House Easter Egg Roll where kids come and horse around on the White House lawn and have Easter eggs and stuff. And once again this year-- like every year-- the whole thing was won by a kid from Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's crazy, but I love him? Kim Jong-Un. ... He's the son of Kim Jong-Il and he's the evil North Korean dictator, but gosh I get a kick out of the guy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama shot baskets at the White House and only made two shots out of 22. Even Dick Cheney was like, 'That guy needs to learn to shoot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Obama went only 2-for-22. It is tough times for Obama. One minute he is asking Congress to raise the debt ceiling, the next day he's asking them to lower the hoop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was sweet. Yesterday at the White House Easter Egg Roll, President Obama comforted a five-year-old boy who started crying.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After North Korea announced that it will restart a nuclear reactor, the US Navy is sending a warship closer to North Korea. And if that doesn't get their attention, they're going to send a Carnival Cruise ship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these are dark times for opponents of same-sex marriage. Not only is it an abomination against God's law, but I never get invited. ? Last week the Supreme Court heard arguments in two different gay marriage cases, which they won't rule on until June. Wedding season! ... If they rule in favor of gay marriage, they will be ignoring sound legal arguments against it. Like 'Eww.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship.' So, if they can't have a sexual relationship, what's it really all about? Everhart knows it's not about marriage. It's not about gay rights. It's not even about gay people. This is about heterosexual fraud. She says, 'You may be as straight as an arrow, and you may have a friend that is as straight as an arrow. Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you're gay, and y'all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it's all about a free ride.' Yes. A free ride. This entire battle about marriage equality has really been about straight men, trying to get free healthcare. Because if there's one thing I know about straight guys, it's that they will jump at the chance for their peers to think they might be gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairwoman of the Republican Party in Georgia has an interesting new argument against same-sex marriage. Sue Everhart is her name. She believes if same-sex marriage is legalized, straight people will pretend to be gay to get married to get health benefits. She said, 'Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. What would prevent you from saying that you're gay and you all get married and you get all the benefits?' I don't know? Probably the same thing that would prohibit you from saying you're straight and doing it. The best part of her argument is it actually is the premise of the Adam Sandler-Kevin James movie 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.' Maybe she was led to believe that was a documentary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last election proved that if they're ever gonna win again, the GOP needs to capture the youth vote. Fear not, Republicans are on it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let me tell you: Some of the questions on this bad boy are totes mad poppin' fresh.

If so, which people?,' with options including 'African Americans, white people, Latinos, Asians, gays and lesbians,' or 'the Republican Party does not discriminate against anyone.' That's easy - the answer is the GOP does not discriminate against anyone. Least of all white people, who are the only option the survey refers to as people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Kim Kardashian's life is like a roller-coaster. Kim Jong Un isn't tall enough to ride one. Kim Kardashian's favorite movie is called 'Failure to Launch.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week on the 'Today' show, Chelsea Clinton said that she's open to running for a political office one day. When she heard that, Sasha Obama was like, 'Cool, how does Secretary of State sound? We can make that happen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately, if you've been watching the television or reading the newspapers, you may have noticed the Federal government, thanks to deadlock-inertia and what many analysts are calling 'fatheadedness,' is not really doing anything when it comes to governing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've got to say, with all the depressing news about possible war with North Korea and the endless debate over gun violence, I just want to lighten the mood a little and talk about the massive oil spill in Mayflower, Arkansas. The historic site where the Mayflower landed. That's not right. The Pilgrims landed at Little Rock, I think. All I know it was definitely Arkansas, because they came over on an ark. You might be asking, 'Stephen why haven't we heard anything about the cleanup of the rupture of the Pegasus pipeline that spilled 150,000 gallons of tar sand oil?' That's because Exxon has contained the cleanup...coverage by threatening to have reporters arrested for trespassing, and at Exxon's request, the FAA ordered a no-fly zone over the area, and everyone is respecting the no-fly zone, especially the birds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US and South Korean officials today say they're highly confident that North Korea will launch a medium-range missile anytime now, which I guess means Dennis Rodman failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The missiles are believed to have a range of about 2,000 miles. No one knows for sure, but they could hit targets in Japan and South Korea for sure, even possibly Hawaii and Guam, which is bad. And yet, why do I feel like this whole thing could be solved by sending Kim Jong Un a Disneyland Park hopper pass?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the ships at sea, nation, I say it all the time. America's military is the baddest...kickingest fighting force in the history of forever! You get in our way and we'll spend 10-15 years taking you down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America now has a laser that can do anything from burn through a fast attack boat to emit a nonlethal burst to dazzle the enemy. That's right. It's the Navy's most dazzling technology since they weaponized Cher. Now, I want the world to know that even though America now possesses laser weapons, it does not mean we're going to turn into an evil empire, although I will say...that we know the Ewoks are aiding the rebels, and I find your lack of faith highly laser-able.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends, I have long warned you about the threats coming from the United Nations - the world's most powerful, completely impotent organization. ... Well, tonight I'm giving a wag of my finger to the UN for going after what we hold more precious than our children: Our guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the UN is trying to convince us that gun control will make us safer. According to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the treaty 'will help to keep warlords, pirates, terrorists and criminals and their like from acquiring deadly arms.' You might think, Stephen, sounds look a good idea, because I don't want evil people to have guns. ... If you wanted to take guns away from all evil people, I suppose you would start with Hitler, right? Pretty bad guy. Well guess what? He shot himself with a gun. If you want to take away his gun, you are really saying you wish Hitler was still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Senate is opening debate tomorrow on a Second Amendment-crushing gun control bill that may not include restrictions on semiautomatics or magazine capacity, but does include background checks and a complete ban on holding your gun sideways because you saw it in a movie once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Kentucky Senator and home-perm cautionary tale Rand Paul promised that he would filibuster this bill. Now the Republicans have cold feet, just because 85% of the gun owners favor universal background checks. Well, of course owners are okay with background checks. They've already got their guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, after months of wrangling, President Obama has unveiled his highly-anticipated 2014 budget. And apparently, neither Democrats nor Republicans are happy with it. And Obama said, 'Yeah, that's how you know it's good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Dick Cheney told house Republicans that the US is in, 'deep doo-doo with North Korea.' Incidentally, 'deep doo-doo' is the color of the shoes I just got at Target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, Congress returned from spring break. See, Congress spring break is a little different from college spring break. In Congress spring break, you screw as many people as you can when you come back from vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has warned North Korea about starting a war. ... China told them flat out, 'Do not fire any missiles at the United States, at least until after we get our money. They owe us $16 trillion, wait until then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, some experts believe that North Korea has a missile that could reach Los Angeles. And, of course, if North Korea did attack Los Angeles, that would, of course, start a war with Mexico. And the whole thing would escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the Wall Street Journal.com, Anthony Wiener ... now thinking about running for mayor of New York City. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, nation. This week NASA unveiled an exciting new plan to fight our space enemies?Yes, a NASA lasso because the most advanced technology they can afford with their budget is rope.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida senator and former astronaut Bill Nelson said the mission would 'help NASA have the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid away if one headed to Earth.' And if nudging doesn't work they could forced to develop scooching technology. Folks I love this plan to drag an asteroid into Earth's orbit because nothing embodies the spirit of American laziness like bringing space to us.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So bravo NASA for pioneering the future of space-stayploration and I dream of a day when one small step for man is literally one step because we parked the moon outside the Kennedy Space Center.&quot; Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 2012 Presidential campaign will most likely be best remembered for the battle the Republicans and Democrats waged for the African-American vote.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;In 2012 President Obama won 93% of the black vote.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Oh, they were so close. All that is about to change as the Republican Party began minority voter outreach program. Yesterday Kentucky Senator Rand Paul fell asleep on the Washington metro's green line and ended up at historically black Howard University where he decided to speak.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Korean pop star, Psy?he just announced that he's gonna release his new song tomorrow. As soon as they heard that, North Korea was like, 'oh, now they're really asking for it.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, listen to this, according to 'Foreign Policy Magazine,' the United States and North Korean officials secretly met in New York City last month. In fact, sources say this meeting was so secret, not even Dennis Rodman knew about it.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday on North Korean state television, they broadcast a poem entitled 'Final War with the US Imperialists.' And the sad thing, still got higher ratings than NBC. I couldn't believe that.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney, he has spoken out about the North Korean situation. He said, 'When it comes to North Korea, we are in deep doo doo.' That was his exact quote. Deep doo doo. So apparently, all those years of briefing President Bush have taken their toll, you know?&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest is that North Korea officials are planning a cyber attack on the US in an effort to bring our economy to a halt. Nice try, guys. You're five years too late, okay?&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, President Obama hosted Republican senators for dinner at the White House. The President said he had to do without salt, pepper, and butter, because as you know, the Republicans refused to pass anything.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a long list of celebrities have signed a letter to President Obama asking him to ease the nation's drug enforcement policy. Hollywood celebrities are and musicians want the President to ease our drug laws. It's always the people you least expect. I'm stunned by that.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mattel is coming under fire for the new doll, the Mexican Barbie, because she comes with her own little pink passport.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are still very tense in North Korea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's looking like President Obama might actually get his gun control bill passed. Politicians are ? they're all weighing in.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Anthony Weiner, remember him?...Well, he told 'The New York Times Magazine' he's thinking of running for mayor of New York City.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next, nation, I've told you about the Republican Party's rad, new effort to totally connect with us young Americans. Well, they've done it again.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;The National Republican Congressional Committee made the move to redesign their website. Enter Buzzfeed, an all encompassing site that mixes politics, pop culture and weird news from all over the world.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;This is the new site. Essentially it's the NRCC's attempt to take everything that made Buzzfeed work and feed it through a partisan political prism.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes the NRCC is taking inspiration from pop-culture, list-making site Buzzfeed, which itself takes inspiration from ADHD.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, I've been inter-surfing the new Buzzfeed-inspired NRCC site, and there are ten reasons this adorable pundit loves it. Check out this actual story: '13 Animals That Are Really Bummed On Obama-care's Third Birthday,' featuring this baby seal with the line, 'Obama-care is leaving job creators out in the cold.' Or this puppy with the line, 'This puppy is upset that health insurance premiums are actually $3,000 higher since Obama-care passed.' I have not seen such an effective mix of bald political messaging and cuddly animals since gerbils and their benighted sub-human race posters. So, bravo, NRCC, for taking inspiration from Buzzfeed. I would not be surprised if they got some ideas from you, too, like the '18 Most Embarrassing Republican Youth Outreach Fails.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On Sunday, 'Gang of Eight' member 'Captain Thirsty', aka 'No-Spit Johnson', aka 'The Human Desiccant', aka 'The Gel Packet They Put in Clothes So They Don't Retain Moisture', [Marco] Rubio laid out the path.&quot; Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida: &quot;You're going to have to pay a fine, an application fee. You have to pass a background check.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Background check? That's easy to get around, background check. All you've got to do is tell immigration you're a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a strange day today. First of all, he was forced to address a rumor involving Jay-Z and Beyonce. Jay-Z and Beyonce celebrated their anniversary in Cuba earlier this month, even though Americans are not permitted to travel to Cuba without permission from the government. Jay-Z just released a song called 'Open Letter' about the trip, and the lyrics say, 'Boy from the hood, but got White House Clearance. Obama said chill, you're going to get me impeached.' And some people assumed that meant Obama gave them the okay to travel there. But during an interview with the 'Today Show,' Obama said he didn't. He said we got better things to do. He's keeping his mind on our money and our money on his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On top of that, it was revealed today that someone sent President Obama a suspicious letter containing the poison ricin. Ricin is a deadly poison made from beans. It's silent, but deadly poison made from beans. They said ricin is the third worst substance you can send in the mail behind anthrax and packing peanuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's funny, people think a letter they send to the President is going to be delivered to his desk. I've got news for you. The President doesn't open his own mail. He's busy planning vacations for Beyonce and Jay-Z.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal law enforcement agencies say they believe the letter to Obama was from the same individual who sent a ricin-filled envelope to Republican Senator Roger Wicker yesterday. So, at least the guy's bipartisan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI has the suspect in custody. His name is Kenneth Curtis, and they think he's the guy ? this is true ? because both letters were signed, 'I am KC and I approve this message.' It was either him or Katie Couric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President weighed in on North Korea today. The White House believes North Korea has a number of medium-range, non-nuclear missiles set up on their east coast ready to fire. The missiles could easily strike targets in South Korea, which?you know what? I'm sick of 'Gangnam Style' too, but missiles to South Korea? It seems like an overreaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mysterious letters sent to President Obama and Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker. Tests indicate these letters contain the poison ricin. Sadly, when you're in the public eye, this stuff happens. That's why I never open my own email.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fast-moving story and there's still a lot we don't know. For instance, there's a Senator Roger Wicker? There's only 100 of these folks and I never heard that name before. Roger Wicker does not sound plausible as a senator. Sounds more like a patio furniture store. Next thing, you're telling me there's a Congresswoman Jennifer Convertibles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama working very hard to get his immigration bill passed. ... This is a true story. President Obama offered to wash senators' cars if it would lead to an immigration bill. He did. He said, 'I'll wash your car.' Senators then told Obama, 'If you're going to wash our cars, why do we need immigrants?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he did not know Jay-Z and Beyonce were taking a trip to Cuba. When he heard this, Bill Clinton was outraged and said the President should know where Beyonce is at all times! It's part of the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator Rand Paul, of course a big favorite for the tea party, suggested he may run for president in 2016, although his first choice would be to run for president in 1954.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been three days and concrete information about the terror attacks in Boston has been slow in coming. Luckily, there is one news outlet that doesn't let a lack of facts get in the way of reporting them. Of course, that's the 'New York Post.' Today, they ran this cover story showing two men from the marathon crowd under the headline 'Bag Men: Feds Seek These Two Pictured At Boston Marathon.' So, be on the lookout for these guys. And while you're on the lookout for these guys, keep in mind, these are not the guys. ... A quick tip of the hat to the 'New York Post' for accusing these two innocent men of a horrible crime, because anyone can print accurate information. But the 'Post' always follows the four Ws of journalism: who, whatever, and why wait?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I'm sure you agree with me that it is a proud day to be an American, because thanks to a minority of US Senators, we no longer have to live in fear of some maniac coming after those we love with a gun control bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, 45 brave senators stood tall to protect what they hold most precious: their A-rating from the NRA. Like Republican Senator and Brylcreem storage facility Ted Cruz, who fought this background-check bill because he knows it would put us on an inevitable path to a national gun registry, even though it's not proposed in the bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, just because the bill doesn't propose a gun registry, doesn't mean it won't eventually happen. Remember, there's also nothing in the rule book that says a golden retriever can't play basketball, although, under current law, it can buy a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the heroes were not just Republicans. Four brave Democrats joined in, including Alaska Senator Mark Begich, who celebrated his vote to kill background checks, saying, 'It's dangerous to do any type of policy in an emotional moment.' Yes, true leadership is waiting until the moment has passed. That's why I've always believed that we should have waited until 1950 to declare war on Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I especially want to salute Senate Majority Leader Wayne LaPierre. He delivered a huge victory for a misunderstood minority, the eight-percent of Americans who are against universal background checks. Now, some say anyone who would oppose keeping guns out of the hands of murderers and the mentally ill are outside of the mainstream, perhaps even psychologically unsound themselves. But we'll never know, because thanks to 45 senators, there will be no background checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the failure of the Senate to pass the bill that would have expanded background-checks for gun purchases) &quot;Only the United States Senate could take something that has 86% support of all Americans and an eight-vote majority in the Senate, itself, as a no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet to battle the evil of terror, we started two wars, tortured people, reorganized almost the entire Federal government, disallowed the air-trafficking of shampoo and conditioner, and okayed the robot sky-killing of American citizens if warranted by someone, because one American life lost to terror is one too many, which I agree with. But it seems to me we'll move heaven and earth to do whatever it takes to keep weapons from falling into the hands of foreigners who might kill our citizens, because apparently we think killing our citizens is our job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, how should the United States respond to this act of terror? Where should we strike back? Well, let's review what we know. They are Muslims. They are brothers. Which makes them the Muslim brotherhood. That means Egypt. Then again, they are from Chechnya, located in the Caucasus Mountains, which makes these terrorists Caucasians. So be on the lookout for Caucasian males with dark hair and anger issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the American Society of Civil Engineers recently released their quadrennial report card, and for the first time in 15 years we improved our grade. They gave our infrastructure a D, but this year we have rocketed up to D+. Boom! We are climbing the ladder. By the way, do not climb that ladder. It is a death trap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this report, which gives a comprehensive assessment of a nation's infrastructure, was released in March, but I just got it because the delivery truck spent four days stuck in a pothole. ? According to the report, we can now proudly say that only 25% of our nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. That's right. There is a three-in-four chance if you drive across a bridge, you will make it to the other side. And America can hold its head high, knowing when it comes to our nation's levees, 8% are in acceptable condition. Of the remaining levees, 22% are unacceptable, 42% are constructed of old marshmallow peeps, and 28% don't want to work. They just want to bang on the drum all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Oregon, the Oregon House of Representatives passed a new state law that involves Facebook. It's illegal for employers to ask their employees or job applicants for their passwords to their social media accounts. I didn't know that was legal in the first place. The new law is called the Vacation Feed Protection Act. It's now illegal for employers to force their employees to like or friend them on Facebook. So now if your boss wants to stalk you he has to do it the old fashioned way, from the bushes. I don't ask my employees to friend me, but I require them to come to my office and show me a picture of what they had for lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And the guy the FBI arrested was an Elvis impersonator. An Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis. They burst into his house, they took him into custody, and then yesterday, they realized he was innocent and let him go. When they asked him about the ricin, he said 'I don't even eat rice.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, gay marriage proponents love to compare their struggle to the civil rights movement. Thankfully, conservative stalwart and man who wishes Kenny G would turn down that rock music, Pat Buchanan, recently shot that comparison down, writing, 'When Martin Luther King called on the nation to live up to the meaning of its creed he heard an echo from a thousand pulpits. Treating black folks decently was consistent with what Christians had been taught.' But these gay activists will not get the same kind of support King got from conservative Christians. As Pat writes, 'If the gay rights agenda is imposed we could have priests and pastors preaching not acceptance but principled rejection, a public rejection of the new laws by millions and a refusal by many to respect or obey them. A new era of civil disobedience may be at hand.' ? Our struggle will not be easy, my straight brothers and sisters ? No, we need to take personal action. Just as the Little Rock Nine marched into that school, so too, must we march into Brian and Roger's wedding and chain ourselves to the champagne fountain. And when you RSVP, which of course you'll do because it will be a fun wedding, check the box for chicken, but when you arrive ask for the salmon. It will throw catering into chaos. Then, when they least expect it, sidle up to the DJ and request a one-hour block of Phish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for travelers on Friday. Congress rushed a bill through to allow the FAA to bring air traffic controllers back. As part of a mandatory government spending cut, the FAA was forced to cut hours for air traffic controllers. As of last night, the air traffic controllers were back just in time for Congress to go on vacation this week. Amazing what they can accomplish when an issue affects them directly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the opening of the Bush library, former President Bush's approval rating has gone up. He's now at 47%. He's tied with President Obama. ... I read a story over the weekend that said George Bush was secretly smart. That's one secret the White House never managed to leak out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama held a press conference earlier today. He said he still wants to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility, but he doesn't know how to do it. He should do what he always does. Declare it a small business and tax it out of existence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Senate hearing on drones, former Vice President Walter Mondale said the drone strikes by the United States are used by our adversaries to call us hypocrites. Can you believe that? Walter Mondale is still alive? Really? I'm stunned. I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'The New York Times' is reporting that the CIA has given Afghanistan's President Karzai and his government tens of millions of dollars in cash to buy influence. See, throwing a lot of money at something is not always the solution. Just ask the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk here in California of letting noncitizens serve on juries. The bad news - if you're ever on trial for underpaying your nanny, you could get the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few weeks ago, the FBI arrested an Elvis impersonator in connection with those ricin-tainted letters. ... They let him go. They now report the FBI is searching for a Wayne Newton impersonator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are new reports that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will not run for President in 2016 if Hillary Clinton does. In a statement, Hillary said that she appreciates the decision and the support, and then she added, 'Because I would crush you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of San Diego has said that he wants Mitt Romney to lead San Diego's bid to bring the 2024 Olympics to his city. When asked why, the mayor said, 'Because I don't really want the Olympics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch the news as closely as I do, you know the sequester budget cuts are here. The unemployed have seen smaller benefit checks, some cancer patients have gone without treatment, and lines at New York's LaGuardia airport now start at Chicago's O'Hare. Tough medicine. But conservatives like me know that in a budget crisis, everything nonessential has to go - whether it's food for kids who aren't mine or some other stuff for people I don't know. But there are some things that government spends money on that are worth - stay with me - spending money - stay with me - on. And, as usual, those things are tanks. They are so important that we need them even when we don't need them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, the tanks are going to roll and it's all 'tanks' to Ohio's Senator Rob Portman and Congressman Jim Jordan. It's a brave stance for these fiscal conservatives. Congressman Jordan, who represents Lima, Ohio, where the tanks are manufactured, defended the cost saying, quote, 'The one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country.' The other area, you know ? his district. And if the Army doesn't really want them, that's fine. These two have voted to cut funding to all kinds of services, and the tanks can help fill the gaps. For instance, Meals on Wheels got hit by the sequester. Let's replace it with Breads on Treads. I mean, one of these tanks can barrage the elderly with sticky buns from three miles away. And we may not be able to pay for cancer patients' medicine anymore, but we can offer them one last bad-ass day of adventure. And it's not just the social services. I mean, in the military, the Blue Angels' budget has been slashed, but it will be just as exciting to watch the Gray Tankles. The best part is we won't have to shut down the tank plant in Lima, Ohio. And that will save jobs. Well, two of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market is flirting with 15,000. ... Flirting with 15,000. Isn't that what got Anthony Weiner in trouble?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Carolina Senator Richard Burr?voted no on gun-reform legislation. Last month, Sen. Burr received a $1,000 donation from a British company that manufactures ammunition. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, there is no background check if you plan to buy a senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it seems these days every time you turn on the news, there's another heart-breaking story about victims of gun violence targeting innocent members of Congress. It has to end. And I know I'm not going to win any awards for saying that. Unless the NRA gives out awards. They do? Oh, it's a seat in the Senate? Great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?The latest senseless victim of these victims is New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, one of the heroes who voted to block the gun bill that would have expanded background checks and made Americans wait 30 minutes after eating before firing a gun in a pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'm telling you, we cannot underestimate the danger posed by the victims of gun violence. They are sympathetic figures who are fanatically committed to having someone do something and their numbers are growing every day. That's why Senator Joe Manchin, who co-sponsored the original background-check bill, has vowed to reintroduce it, all on the flimsy excuse that over 90% of Americans want it, making it slightly more popular than nacho cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, with the increasing frequency and magnitude of mass shootings, the victims and their families are winning the emotional argument. But some brave and heartless individuals are willing to fight back against the tyranny of empathy. Like 'National Review' columnist Kevin D. Williamson, who said of Gabby Giffords, quote, 'It should be noted that being shot in the head by a lunatic does not give one any special grace to pronounce upon public policy questions.' Oh, it is noted. Experiencing massive head trauma does not give you special insight. For instance, judging by his column, there is something wrong with Kevin Williamson's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden had a little trouble today. Plane Air Force Two [is] apparently stuck in Arizona because of problems with its engine. Officials say they're trying to fix it as fast as they can. And then Obama was like, 'No rush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney gave the commencement address at Southern Virginia University and he encouraged graduates to get married young and have lots of kids. Then he was like, 'Oh, and give them all weird names. Have you met Tagg?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA has just ruled that girls as young as 15 can now obtain the contraceptive Plan B pill without a prescription, because before that, most teenagers' plan B was getting a show on MTV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Treasury Department says it has enough extra money to pay down some debt for the first time since 2007.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US government apparently spent millions of dollars in cash to fund various dubious government projects in Afghanistan, including solar panels and wind farms that never really work. No, I'm sorry. That's what we did here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had it backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there is now a push in Congress from Republicans and Democrats to spend an extra $436 million on the Abrams tank, even though the Army says they don't want it. The Army says they don't want this tank. They don't need the tank. I mean, how pathetic is that? The only time Congress works together is when it's to waste our money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department released a list of the gifts that President Obama has received from foreign officials. ... Putin gave him vodka; Prince Charles gave him golf bags; and Kim Jong-Un re-gifted Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
