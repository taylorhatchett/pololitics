<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney - have you heard him talking about the CIA torture report? He says the torture report is 'full of crap.' That's good enough for me. He's a regular Churchill, isn't he, that Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that this week's Senate report on the CIA's interrogation techniques suggested that George Bush and Dick Cheney did not know the location of the detention facility. Then Cheney was like, 'Part of the thrill was finding them on my own.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. George Bush and Dick Cheney may not have known the location of the detention facilities. Though in fairness, it took Bush three years to figure out the location of the White House. 'Is it Washington state? Pennsylvania Avenue? It's very confusing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress managed to avoid another government shutdown by agreeing on a $1.1 trillion spending bill. Of course, to get anything passed in this environment, they had to do a lot of compromising. I'll show you what I mean in tonight's edition of 'Split the Diff.' Take a look at this first compromise. The Democrats wanted more funding for school lunches. The Republicans wanted more immigrants deported to Mexico. So they compromised. Now immigrants being deported will receive school lunch on the way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans wanted to expand gun rights. The Democrats wanted to expand animal rights. So their compromise is to give guns to bears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, the Democrats wanted to protect all the national parks. The Republicans wanted to protect the rights of senior citizens. They compromised, and now Larry King has to be forced to live in the forest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news this week has been the Senate's recent report on torture. In response to the Senate's recent report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, former Vice President Dick Cheney said, 'I'd do it again in a minute.' I'm sorry - I misread that. He said, 'I'm doing it again in a minute.' Then he checked his watch and left the room. 'I gotta go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney attacked critics of the CIA's interrogation techniques, saying, 'What are we supposed to do? Kiss them on both cheeks and say, 'Please, please tell us what you know?&quot; Though to be fair, getting kissed by Dick Cheney is also banned by the Geneva Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry said this week that running for president 'is not an IQ test.' It 'is not an IQ test.' He says he knows that because he once took an IQ test and it came back negative&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department ruled that Native American tribes are allowed to grow and sell marijuana on reservations. Grow and sell marijuana. This decision was hailed as a victory by Native American leader Giggling Eagle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A reporter recently asked Governor Rick Perry if he thought he was smart enough to be president. Perry said, 'Hey, I was smart enough to be elected president of Texas, wasn't I? I think so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
