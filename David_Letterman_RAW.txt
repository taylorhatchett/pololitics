And President Clinton thinks, Well, hell, you know, if he can bring peace to his marriage, you know, hes got a shot at bringing peace to the Middle East.So, while President Clintons got his hands full there in Washington, his wife, Hillary, is in Puerto Rico.  Shes down there, Puerto Rico, uh-huh, hoping she can meet some young island guy to help her get her groove back.New books: As he looks ahead to 2000, the Vice President takes pains to distinguish himself from Bill Clinton in this new book right here, Ive Never Even Said Hello To An Intern, by Al Gore. ...  This new travel book is a must-have for White House interns.  Its The Rand McNally Guide To The Oval Office Windowless Corridor. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary. President Clintons spokesman is stepping down on Friday after a long, long, difficult career, and I think Mike McCurry has done a fine job.  You think about it, this guy has really had it rough, because he has had to make just as many denials as President Clinton has had to make.  You know, but he didnt get any of the sex that goes along with it.  You know what Im saying?Yeah, McCurry is stepping down.  Good news, though: He says he may come back to do color commentary during the impeachment.  So thatll be nice.And as a surprise going-away gift -- I thought this was kind of nice, kind of uncalled for, though -- Ken Starr uncovered three of Mike McCurrys sexual affairs.The worlds getting crazier and crazier.  Theres a former White House intern, now, has been arrested for stalking George Stephanopoulos.  Ooh.  It makes you wonder about the screening process that... down there in Washington to become a White House intern, doesnt it?I mean, first of all, there was Monica Lewinsky, White House intern.  Now we have the stalker intern.  How the hell did they miss Amy Fisher?  Thats what I want to know.Hillary Clinton is touring South America right now, ladies and gentlemen, and going on a tour of all the Latin American countries.  Before she left, President Clinton told her to be sure to thank Puerto Rico for Jennifer Lopez.I thought this was nice: while Hillary is out of the country, traveling around South America, the Pentagon is furnishing her with satellite photos of her husbands whereabouts. Shes down there, by the way, in Chile, for the first ladies convention.  First ladies convention.  Wait a minute, wasnt that that Disney movie with Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn? ...  Its a typical first ladies convention that theyre having down there.

A: Her fiancee, Dave, asked her not to.Hey, did you folks get a chance to see the impeachment hearings today on television?  Werent they exciting, huh?  I enjoyed it.  I think my favorite part of the impeachment hearings was the opening musical salute to past impeachments. Strom Thurmond showed up at the impeachment hearings wearing the same suit he wore for the Andrew Johnson impeachment hearings.I thought the highlight of the first day of the impeachment hearings was when -- this was kind of a dramatic moment -- they dimmed the lights, and then they swore in Monica Lewinskys stained dress.You know, the Republicans are going crazy. They want the impeachment proceedings to cover all of President Clintons scandals, or alleged scandals.  And were talking about here: filegate, travelgate, Whitewatergate, Monicagate.  Im telling you, this Clinton has more gates than the Newark Airport.President Gerald Ford was in the New York Times over the weekend in a little article, a little editorial he wrote. ...  He says he doesnt think Clinton ought to be impeached.  He said he should receive a harshly worded rebuke.  Yeah, like I got after I hosted the academy awards.Im thinking back on this. Gerald Ford, while he was in office, was never involved in any sex scandal whatsoever.  Except there was one time he accidentally fell on an intern, but other than that....Its good to have Ross Perot back, and its good to see that hes even crazier than he used to be.  Hes just a full-blown, certified, A.A.A. whack job, Ross Perot.  So Ross Perot, this nosebleed, is on Meet the Press and Larry King, and hes telling people that President Clinton is one of these guys that is mad for power.  He is power crazy.  He is lusting for power.  This is Ross Perot talking about President Clinton.  Then Ross Perot announced that next year he will be running for president for the 14th time!Over the weekend, President Clinton was at Camp David, and he spent the weekend on the phone.  And I actually believe he placed 17 calls to Democratic congressmen, talked to 17 congressman on the phone.  And during those phone calls -- and I think this is a good sign.  I believe this is a sign that maybe hes learned his lesson.  During those phone calls, he only had sex twice.It just seems to me like more of a negative slant regarding the President from CBS News than you might guess. Here, take a look at this.  The Clinton Legacy: on January 20, 1993, William Jefferson Clinton was inaugurated the 42nd president of the United States.  Early in President Clintons tenure, he succeeded in getting Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.  To celebrate, he had sex with a Mexican school teacher on the White House stairs.  In 1996, the President enacted a measure to raise the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour.  He marked the occasion by nailing a counter girl and condiment waitress at a local Wendys.  More recently, President Clinton dropped by the editing room where this video tape was being prepared.  While there, he scored with our tape editor, assistant director, and then he went to my home and had sex with my wife.  Bill Clinton: good riddance to that home-wrecking son of a bitch. Paul Schaefer: A slightly negative edge to it. This may be the first time in the history of this great country of ours that impeachment proceedings contained an article of impeachment which contained the word, jiggy.I think this Henry Hyde has done a very good job of being the Chairman of the impeachment committee, you know.  Henry Hyde, doing a fine job.  Although next year, next year, Im kind of hoping they bring back Billy Crystal.We poke a lot of fun, make a lot of jokes about President Clinton, but in his time of need right now, my heart is going out to President Clinton, because I want to tell you something.  Think about this: When they started the impeachment inquiry procedure -- think about it -- that makes it virtually impossible now for this man to get a date.Jesse Helms says this is what he would like to have happen to Clinton: He would like Clinton to be dragged out onto the floor of the Senate, and have somebody come in and weld his fly shut.  And I thought, well, I dont know.  That seems extreme to me, I said to myself.And the Democrats, on the other hand, they just think that Clinton should be grounded for six weeks. Former President Gerald Ford believes that President Clinton should not be impeached, he should receive a harsh rebuke. Man, thats as bad as it gets.  That is as serious a thing as youre going to find.  I mean, OJ, even OJ didnt get a harsh rebuke.Bob Dole...I dont believe...I dont think Bob Dole ever had a sex scandal.  In all that time, I dont think Bob...And them Im thinking, but, on the other hand, I dont think he ever had an intern under 70.And I want to tell you something, if I look tired and a little more haggard than usual, I went out right after the show with Mr. and Mrs. Bob Dole, Bob and his wife, Elizabeth Dole, and I want to tell you, this Bob Dole is quite a guy.  I bet you he knocked back eight rum and viagras.Are you folks enjoying the impeachment hearings on television?  Are you enjoying the impeachment hearings?  The Republicans, theyre like bulldogs now.  Theyre not going to let this thing go.  Theyre developing quite a case against Clinton.  Here are the charges now theyre trying to get pushed through against Clinton: Obstruction of justice, perjury, and kidnapping an East Side socialite.  Did you know that?Former President Gerald Ford, last weekend, he says hes against the impeachment.  He thinks instead of the impeachment, President Clinton should receive a harsh rebuke.  A harsh rebuke.  I dont know.  And today, Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank said that Clinton should receive a harsh rebuke and brunch.Henry Hyde, the guy whos running the impeachment proceedings, have you seen the guy, Henry Hyde?  Next time you see Henry Hyde, isnt he the guy at the appliance store whos always trying to get you to buy the two-year service contract?You know, this is a little disturbing, if you think about it.  The exodus down there at the White House continues.  This is the kind of thing theyre trying to keep covered up.  You know, Mike McCurry, he left.  He left.  Erskine Bowles, adios.  He left as well.  The newest one to leave, Rahm Emanuel.  You know whats scary here, ladies and gentlemen?  If this trend continues, pretty soon, theres not going to be anybody at the White House except for Clinton and the interns.And a couple of days ago, when they took the vote, there was a very touching moment, I thought.  The Chairman of the impeachment committee, Henry Hyde -- you know Henry Hyde -- after the vote, he runs up into the gallery and hugs the Nixon family.I think Ive actually met this guy.  I think one time years ago, this guy came up to me in a car dealership, this Henry Hyde.  Honestly, I think he said to me: You know, Dave, theres everything else, and then theres the Lincoln Town Car.Some of the Democrats have crossed party lines.  You know, some of them have given up one party to go the other direction.  For example, Ted Kennedy...Ted Kennedy...last night, he left a party at Bennigans to go to a party at Houlihans.Im not a political expert, Im no pundit, Im no genius -- it doesnt look good for President Clinton.  Hes...I understand, people down there tell me hes already working on his farewell address to the interns.You know, they were talking about maybe a settlement with Paula Jones, and I guess Paula Jones wanted a million bucks for the settlement, and Clintons people said, Well, you know, lets...lets negotiate here.  Lets dicker. ... Yeah, so Paula Jones says she wants a million, and President Clintons people say, What about $700,000? She says, No, no, Im not interested.  And Im thinking, Well, it sounds to me like somebodys got some more plastic surgery planned, you know what Im saying?But I guess its not all bad news for President Clinton, because this weekend, President Clinton is celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary. ...  He has plans for a romantic candlelit dinner, and then afterward, hes going to swing by the White House and pick up Hillary.And Im no baseball expert, but the Padres are in a lot of trouble.  And I understand tomorrow night, in a moving, beautiful ceremony at home plate before the game, Padres manager Bruce Bochy will be impeached.Of course, the Bride of Chucky, it turns out its Linda Tripp.Have you been following the peace talks?  The Middle East peace talks taking place in Maryland. You have Yasser Arafat and Bibi Netanyahu.  And President Clinton very, very concerned about the peace talks.  He actually canceled a trip to go to California so that he could move the peace talks along.  You see, hes very worried that if the peace talks drag on much longer, hes going to miss his own impeachment and its driving him nuts.Dont kid yourself.  Clinton is taking these peace talks very serious.  Not only did he cancel his trip to California, but earlier today, he canceled his 4:00 oclock intern.Heres another way you can tell the Padres suck, ladies and gentlemen.  Their new mascot is an intern.And of course, President Clinton, like hes got nothing else to do, he calls...the clubhouse and talks to (Yankees manager) Joe Torre.  You know, its the traditional congratulatory telephone call, President Clinton calling Joe Torre.  And God bless President Clinton. He gets his calls mixed up, and he says to Torre, So, Joe, what are you wearing?When the Yankees won the World Series,  I havent seen so much high-fivin and champagne-drinking since the Republicans got the Starr report.Now, theyre saying that the 1998 Yankee team could be the greatest team ever assembled, ever assembled.  1998 Yankees could be the greatest team ever assembled. Thats right.  Theyre even comparing it to the 1995 White House interns.The San Diego Padres didnt even really put up a fight, did they?  (The Yankees) swept 4-0.  Ive been thinking about this -- Im no baseball expert -- Ive been thinking about this all day, and the Padres, I mean, what can you say?  I mean, my God, they went down faster than White House interns.By the way, congratulations to President Clinton.  I think he did a darned nice job negotiating that Middle East...am I the only one applauding?  The Middle East peace agreement.  I thought so.  The peace negotiations, as you can imagine, very, very emotional situation.  And when they were concluded -- I thought this was a great thing -- Clinton and Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat were all hugged by the Roger Maris family.Clinton is so confident now, hes even thinking about maybe trying to negotiate a peace settlement with his wife.By the way, happy birthday to the First Lady, Hillary Clinton.  I believe yesterday, 51 years old. ...  So to celebrate the birthday yesterday, President Clinton and Hillary shared a quiet dinner, to be followed by another quiet dinner... followed by another quiet dinner, and another and another, and another.As I mentioned, John Glenn is certainly no stranger to space travel.  A former astronaut, and during his years in the Senate, he spent most of his time trying to escape the gravitational pull of Ted Kennedy. Bad news from Moscow, ladies and gentlemen.  Boris Yeltsin is sick again.  Thats right.  Hes not feeling well.  Thats right.  Hes doing very badly.  In fact, hes so ill, he may not be able to attend his own funeral.And the doctors did an examination on him, and they found a clot in his blood.  Found a clot.  Turned out it was an olive.Im no political science expert, Im no political pundit, but boy, the politics here in New York City are really getting dirty.  Do you know what Im talking about?

Thats the day when millions and millions and millions of Americans leave work early and pretend to vote.Whenever I go into the voting machine and right into the booth there, close the curtain, you see, then I slip out of my pants.  And I take my pants and I hold them out the curtain, you know, like this.  And, Im shaking them, and Im screaming, Hey!  Hey, do these come in a 32? Here in New York, I guess the big hotly...heated, contested race is for Senate.  Its Al DAmato and Chuck Schumer.  Have you folks been following this thing? ...  I tell you, the tragedy of this race, the tragedy of this campaign, the Schumer-DAmato Senate seat campaign, the real tragedy, I think, is that one of these guys is going to win.I dont want to say that Al DAmato has run a negative, ugly, nasty, vicious campaign.  But earlier today, he received a last-minute endorsement from the Bride of Chucky.And Im no political expert, Im no political pundit.  I dont know what the hell is going on.

So, man, so it really was a good day for Clinton.And Jesse the Body Ventura, now, hes six foot, five inches tall, weighs 270, 280 pounds.  He is the largest public office holder in the US.

He said the thing that he will regret most is, you know, he wont be in Washington for the impeachment.And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, Im no expert, Im no political pundit.  Im beginning to believe that this whole impeachment thing...this whole impeachment thing, Im beginning to think now, was Clintons idea...so he could get rid of the Republicans.As I understand it, Newt Gingrich knew that he was going to have to step aside.  He knew that he was not long for a political future when he lost the support of the Roger Maris family.Youre worried about Newt getting a job?

Thats interesting. The guy has no problem losing an intern, but hes worried about his pension.The interview with Connie Chung was an historic broadcast, because for a full 30 minutes, for the first time, Condits wife actually knew the woman he was with.So this guy is what they call a serial adulterer, and his wife is forgiving him, and theyre on television holding hands.

And he was evasive, he was crafty, he was defensive, but on the other hand, I thought he was just plain creepy.Gary Condit comes off so shifty and so weasely, even if he did confess, people would still think he was lying.The kid who pitched the perfect game in the Little League world series, Danny Almonte, do you know about this?

So he gave himself a lie detector test and it turns out he passed. Yes, he passed the test. There was a couple tricky questions but he passed the test.And then later, as the story progressed, later there was a lot more controversy. So heres what he did, he tried to beat a confession out of himself. That didnt work.You have got to understand a guy in this position, hes very defensive, very, very defensive and I think his defense is getting more and more desperate.

So ever since that interview, hes been huddling with his advisers and, seriously, I think I speak for everyone when I say, Wait a minute, somebodys advising this guy?Hes actually getting advice from somebody, this guy? He commits one PR nightmare after another. But, you know, the good news is this time hes just digging his own grave, so thats the good news.Former President Bill Clinton is down there in Rio de Janeiro and he, apparently, theres a big picture of him in the paper, hes out there on the beach with his shorts and his big fat stomach, and hes staring at topless women.

Hell be picking up another flight attendant, so there you go.Remember when President Bush said, Im going away on a 30-day vacation, we just all laughed silly, like, What? Really? 30 what?

Yeah, weve got an old commercial from the 2000 campaign. Its a Gary Condit campaign ad from the year 2000 election. Take a look. Congressman Gary Condit -- for the past 11 years hes worked hard for northern California. If reelected, he will make good on these three promises: He will fight to lower taxes. He will improve the quality of California schools. And under no circumstances will he have an illicit affair with an intern who ends up mysteriously disappearing and then lie about the whole thing on national television to Connie Chung. Thats the Condit guarantee. Paid for by the Committee to Reelect Gary Condit.On Labor Day, everybodys having a barbecue.

I think that makes sense if youre 45 and living in a cave, I would bet booze somehow...You know what they say about this guy, this Mayor-elect Bloomberg, they say he is a business genius. And Im thinking, gee, really, hes a business genius? I dont know, he spent $50 million to get a $100,000 a year job.You know, he and Mayor Giuliani have a lot in common. Both of them have girlfriends and neither one can get Donna Hanover out of Gracie Mansion, so...Taliban leader Mullah Omar has challenged George Bush to a duel, and he countered...Bush countered the challenge, he challenged Omar to six innings of T-ball.Bush thought it over and he decided hed go ahead with the duel.

So among other things what this means is the people in Kabul can now watch television for the first time in ten years. Its like a big deal for them. Theyre getting out the set hooking it up turning it on and all over the city you can hear people saying, Boy, Dave got old.But the people in Kabul are going nuts shaving beards, throwing away their turbans, lining up to see Shallow Hal.And because of the takeover all of the Taliban leaders are trying to get out of Kabul. Its crazy. Yesterday the local U-Haul ran out of camels.The Taliban has fled Kabul. And now, now that the Taliban is gone you can now smoke, you can dance, you can play music. Im telling you Kabul once again is fun city, ladies and gentlemen.And the Taliban is on the run. They are hiding out and they dont know where to go. Because Pakistan does not want them. Iran does not want them. However, of course, theyll have no problem getting into this country, but thats another story.You know, its interesting with the Taliban gone theyre allowed to play all kinds of music.

All over the country they are turning them on and saying Oh, Leno is guest hosting for Carson.President Bush and Vladmir Putin, Putin is at President Bushs ranch. Vladmir Putin is down there in Texas at the big ranch. In his honor George Bush had an old-fashioned hoedown. I was thinking about this.

What a rough crowd last night. The entire audience last night was on an FBI watch list, the whole audience.Youve been reading about whats going on in Kabul. Its an amazing transformation in a couple of days. It just turned upside down and retail stores, business is booming. Except for one store, that Veils for Less.The Taliban is out of the picture and people are getting their TVs back and watching TV for the first time in ten years. Theyre stunned. They cant believe the cast of 60 Minutes is still alive.Theyve had no music in Afghanistan and the whole country musically speaking is completely backward, they think P. Diddy is still Puff Daddy.You think your weekend is dull. Listen to this. Osama bin Laden will be in his cave all weekend with Mullah Omar playing checkers.Congratulations to the Northern Alliance.

This guy has five wives, and one of them, one of his wives is his 14-year-old cousin. Isnt that crazy? He married his 14-year-old cousin. Of course in those days, he was known as Jerry Lee bin Laden.Things have turned upside down completely within a couple of weeks. Unbelievable. Now Afghanistan says theyre looking for help from other countries, because they want to get into the television business, and I said to myself...what a coincidence, so does CBS.That Al Qaeda organization, they have ten Osama bin Laden look- alikes. Its amazing.

And then you leave them there.Dont kid yourselves. There are bargains everywhere. Everywhere you go, there are bargains. For example, today, Osama bin Laden knocked 30% off the price on his head, 30% off. Come and get me. 30% off.One good thing about this Thanksgiving, because of all the security, you know, I got to drive my family to the airport five hours earlier.We had the big Letterman family Thanksgiving at my house.

They say this guy is now currently living in an underground fortress known as Wolfs Hole. Living in an underground fortress known as Wolfs Hole. What is this guy, Goldfinger?When youre on the run like that and youre living in caves, theres a lot of tension, and a lot of anxiety and a lot of pressure. So Osama and his boys -- when theyre on the lam like that, hiding out in caves -- are always looking for stuff to do. So last night, they got together and they watched the Jihad blooper reel.Im having a lousy day. Heres what happened. Im driving to work this morning, and I get pulled over for speeding by a cop. And instead of writing me a ticket, he hands me over to a military tribunal.It looks now like Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar -- his buddy, his lieutenant -- are living together in a cave somewhere. Theyre hiding out in a cave together. I dont... I dont think this is going to work, because one of them is...you know, kind of a slob...and the other one is really kind of a neat freak.I think the number one public relations blunder that this Osama bin Laden made, is he lives in a cave fortress.

The Northern Alliance busted in and they found a cave in which he used to live. And its like full of nothing but boxes of macaroni.

So, its macaroni and a lot of really big underpants. Im telling you, it sounds like Graceland, doesnt it?Last night, what a rough crowd we had last night.

The only thing that broke the silence was the sound of sporadic gunfire.The worst selling toy, and you could he guessed this, is Tickle Me Osama bin Laden.Well, Over in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of the cave and saw his shadow so that means six more weeks of bombing.And the Taliban are continuing with their brilliant military strategy, the suicide surrender.About a week ago, people reported seeing Osama bin Laden with friends at a restaurant. The single biggest manhunt in the history of the world and this guy is at Red Lobster.They found a cave that Osama bin Laden used to occupy.

This is...in the world of terrorists this guy was like a really big deal the recruiter the guy that came up with the recruiting slogan - Were looking for a few mentally deranged lunatics.But Osama bin Laden has this impenetrable fortress carved into a mountainside. Hes living now like, well, Merv Griffin.Its the single biggest manhunt in the history. World and a couple of weeks ago people said that they saw Osama bin Laden with this of his buddies having dinner at a restaurant. Turns out it was just an annual holiday thing he does for the staff.I thought this was fascinating. Court TV is holding a fantasy trial of Osama bin Laden, you know?

You know things are not going well for the Jihad when your supreme leader is living in his Toyota. Thats a bad sign.They got this California guy, have you heard about this, fighting for the Taliban? Its just unbelievable. They capture the guy, and now apparently hes very depressed because he had his heart set on a career as a suicide bomber.He moved from California to Afghanistan. I want to tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, that is the worst decision since I decided to leave NBC and come to CBS.This Osama bin Laden now, they say hes had plastic surgery. They say he sneaked across the border into Pakistan and had plastic surgery, which by the way is the place to go for plastic surgery. . And he looks great. He looks fantastic.

He wasnt very happy.Now there are reports that Osama bin Laden would like to commit suicide on television. Ill tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, this is the kind of lead in I have been praying forever since I came to CBS.Osama bin Laden is planning a televised suicide, or as I call it, hosting the Academy Awards.They say that Osama bin Laden is no longer able to communicate with his agents.

Putin will think twice about it now. Last thing he wants to do is offend the United States so they stay home from a summit meeting. That looks pretty bad on your record.[Referring to the conflict in Ukraine] Putin said he did not invade the Crimea. What are those, mall cops? I mean, he said he did not invade Crimea, and he said the tanks that you see rolling through the streets - he said thats just part of the closing ceremonies of the Olympics.US is talking about imposing sanctions on Russia.

The CIA was doing all of this torturing activity, and George Bush - and I thought, now, wait a minute. This doesnt sound like the George Bush I know.Dick Cheney - have you heard him talking about the CIA torture report? He says the torture report is full of crap. Thats good enough for me. Hes a regular Churchill, isnt he, that Dick Cheney?Jeb Bush thinks hes going to run for president, and if youre excited about that, then you dont remember the first two Bush presidencies.To demonstrate transparency, Jeb Bush released 250,000 emails.

Bush has a new team of lawyers. Theyre pretty good. Theyre the team, I believe, that handled his last drunk driving arrest, so theyre first rate.The good news is the White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings. Some of these jokes actually write themselves.I feel bad for George W. because hes talking like he wants to be the president, but when you see him, you can tell he really doesnt want to be the president. And as a result, George W. is getting no respect whatsoever.

You folks really cleared up that mess.By the way, Florida, do us a favor. Stay out of the next election.For the last month there have been like 10,000 attorneys down there in Florida.

Bush, though -- all kidding aside -- he had a pretty busy day. He met with congressional leaders. He stopped by the White House, took a look around there. He went to see, Dude, wheres my car?You got to give him credit. Hes selecting cabinet members now, and hes really reaching out. His new attorney general is Della Reese.So far in the cabinet, George W. Bush has selected two women. Two important positions -- hes selected two women for those positions.  But to be fair, nobody has put women in more positions, I think, than President Clinton.Are you ready for tonights Clinton Classic? Originally told December 28, 1999. . President Clinton gave Al Gore a Big Mouth Billy Bass for Christmas. Coincidentally, thats what Bills been using since Monica left.(Tuesdays taping was broadcast to US service members in Tuzla, Bosnia.) Heres the makeup of the folks85% male, 15% female. Thats also how they described Janet Reno.We had a great election, and I dont know if you folks in Bosnia, I dont know if you heard about the election. We have a new president, and it went very smoothly.Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, it must be very confidence-building to know that the new president not only could not find this place, but cannot pronounce it, as well.George W. Bush was down in Washington earlier today meeting with President Clinton. It was very, very touching, very moving.

I was being considered to be the new secretary of labor, but my nomination has hit a snag. Apparently the press found out about my Filipino pool boy, Chi Chi.So George W. Bush is bringing a lot of new faces into the cabinet. His choice for secretary of Navy is Sir Francis Drake.Otherwise, George W. Bush, right now hes on his ranch in Texas, resting up from his vacation in Florida.Its official now. Hillary Clinton is the junior senator from the great state of New York. Hillary Clinton is now our junior senator. When they swore her in, she used the Clinton family bible -- you know, the one with only seven commandments.And President Clinton.its like a week and change, and the guys done. Hes out after eight years. So its going to be hard. You know, we make a lot of fun at President Clintons expense, but...this transition is going to be tough for this guy because, think about it.
