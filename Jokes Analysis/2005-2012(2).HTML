<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'US' magazine reporting that Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey have split up. ... See, this kind of thing really upsets me. We knew Nick and Jessica were having problems months ago. And did FEMA do anything?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's top adviser Karl Rove will be testifying for the fourth time before a grand jury at the Federal courthouse in Washington next week. You know, Maybe Bush should nominate him to the Supreme Court. He's been in more courtrooms than Harriet Miers now, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you the Republicans are having their problems. Karl Rove testifying, as said, for the fourth time next week. Tom DeLay indicted for the second time. Bill Frist being investigated. You know, for a party that hates trial lawyers, they sure do hire a lot of them, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security officials are now telling people in New York City to be on the lookout for men traveling alone and speaking a foreign language. That's pretty much the Yankees' pitching staff, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, the threat is not as bad as they thought yesterday. Today the Mayor of New York City wanted to reassure New Yorkers. He said the New York City subways are still safe to urinate in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush today called those who support terrorism evil but not insane. As opposed to those people who just bought an SUV. They're insane but not evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;As you may have heard, oil, now under $60 a barrel. You know what this means for the American consumer? Nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a full page ad from the oil and gas industry in the paper today -- explaining to us, you know, it says where does the dollar you pay for a gallon of gas go? Well, 54 cents towards the crude oil. 30 cents to refining transportation. And 16 cents goes to taxes. Here's my question, where do you get a gallon of gas for a dollar?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;What's the other $2.50? That's pretty all much profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what's being called the first case of espionage in the White House in modern history -- this is pretty serious -- a former Marine that who worked for Vice President Dick Cheney at the White House being accused of stealing top secret information and passing it on. And you know the sad part about this, the guy accused of spying, he was Bush's second choice for Supreme Court nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush's number one choice, Harriet Miers, issued a statement today saying she's getting closer and closer to having an opinion on something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, this is interesting, conservatives on the far right are mad at President Bush for nominating Harriet Miers. And liberals are still mad at him for nominating John Roberts. So he is a uniter, not a divider. No, he's done the impossible. He's got both conservatives and liberals teamed up against him. You know how hard that is to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're wondering how Harriet Miers got the nomination, she probably saw this ad. Take a look.&quot; Ad announcer: &quot;Tired of working at a dead end job? Wish you do more with your life? Well, now you can, at the George W. Bush Institute for Supreme Court judges. You'll soon discover that interpreting constitutional law has never been easier. No experience is necessary. In fact, it's not even encouraged. So trade in that hairnet and name tag for a long, black robe and become a Supreme Court judge by enrolling at the George W. Bush Institute for Supreme Court judges. Easy financing is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former FBI Director, Louis Freeh has a new book out. I think he's on 60 Minutes Sunday. He goes after President Clinton. He says that Clinton's closets were full of skeletons. Skeletons? So I guess there were some skinny chicks we didn't know about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal, we may soon be able to vote in our elections by telephone. You can vote by telephone. Don't have to go to the voting booth anymore. This is using a law passed in 2002 called the 'American Idol' Act that allows you to vote by phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Defense Department is having a race for robotic vehicles across the desert. Any kind of vehicle that can be driven by remote control can compete for the $2 million prize. So far the top contender is a Hummer driven by a robot, or as we call that -- the Governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the fall television season, I don't think it is going that well for NBC. Earlier today, President Bush made his fourth trip to the set of 'Joey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this, President Bush has nominated Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. And this very, very important. She's a member of the president's inner circle. That is how they describe her. She has never really been a judge before but they describe her as an important member of the president's inner circle. That means she's his designated driver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers told reporters, this is a quote, 'President Bush is the most brilliant man I've ever met.' That's a quote, yeah. Actually, the entire quote was, 'President Bush is the most brilliant man I've ever met who still eats paste.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Columbus Day, everybody. The holiday named, of course, for the man who discovered America. Although President Bush said Columbus didn't really occupy the country so much as liberate the Indians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Columbus did not set out to discover America. No, no, no. He was looking for a quicker route to India. You know why he was trying to get to India? Anybody know? He was trying to get the King of Spain's computer fixed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, actually, Columbus Day is quite controversial. This is a day of celebration for Italians, but it offends a lot of Native Americans. But see, I can understand both points of view. That's why I'm a very open person. I try to honor both. Like every Columbus Day, I go to an Indian casino and have a big Italian dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most medical historians now believe it was Christopher Columbus who brought sexually transmitted diseases to the new world. But on the other hand, the Indians gave him tobacco. So it's pretty much a wash.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US relief supplies have already started arriving in Pakistan. That's pretty quick, huh? I didn't realize Pakistan was so much closer to the United States than New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was reported today that troops may stay on in New Orleans through next year. Next year there will be troops in New Orleans. Pretty amazing, isn't it? Not only does Bush not have an exit strategy for Iraq, we don't even have one for New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, a huge wildfire jumped across the border from Mexico to California. Here is the really strange part -- today it got a job at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rain, major flooding all over New Hampshire. Bridges collapsed, roads were washed out. In fact it prompted Kanye West to say President Bush doesn't care about the one black guy that lives in New Hampshire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news on that spy they arrested who was working in Vice President Dick Cheney's office. Did you hear about that story? Pretty amazing. Turns out he started working at the White House during the Clinton Administration. Well, duh. I mean, where do you think he learned how to sneak around without getting caught? He learned from the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security has been increased on all New York City subways after authorities received a word of a terrorist threat. Officials here in LA also calling for increased security on LA subways as soon as we can figure out where the hell they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody looking for a job in TV? Did you hear this? Al Qaeda is hiring. I'm not making this up. On its website, al Qaeda is looking to hire people for video production work. It's for young people who are terrorists who really want to direct, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda is looking for people. And they have several -- they said 'Vacant positions available.' I imagine if one of your most common entry level positions is suicide bomber, there's going to be a lot of openings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's top adviser Karl Rove will be testifying for the fourth time, fourth time before the grand jury at the Federal courthouse in Washington this week. And President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers, is fascinated by all this. Today she asked Rove, 'What goes on in those Federal courthouses anyways?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know a lot about this Harriet Miers, but she told the New York Times, she said that George Bush was the most brilliant man she ever met. You know, this chick's got to meet more guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Air Force is now developing a non-lethal microwave ray that they can fire at enemy ground troops. They would literally microwave the enemy through this ray. Very sophisticated, too, and it has different settings for different countries. Like Turkey, you set it to high for 15 minutes. Chinese, you put it on reheat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some researchers now believe fat can be used as a source of stem cells. They can use fat. Well, that should secure America's lead in stem cell research, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stem cells from fat may one day be used to cure a number of diseases. Your fat ass may one day save your fat ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Federal health officials issued new warnings about the bird flu. They say be on the lookout for weak, sickly looking birds like the Philadelphia Eagle, a bird that's not able to protect itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Columbus Day here in New York City, and the new terror alert color is marinara.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said, there may be trouble, things to look for. There may be a bag here, look at the bag there. They put on 1,000 extra cops. Thank God everything turned out, it was all right. But yesterday, I'm on the subway, and security was unbelievably tight. And a guy comes up to me and says, take off your pants. And I said, I said, 'Are you from Homeland Security?' And he said, 'No I just want to settle a bet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Harriet Miers? Who wants to be a Supreme Court judge? Fill out the application as you leave the theater tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Harriet Miers, so yesterday she goes to church, and at her church she receives a standing ovation. Harriet Miers gets a standing ovation. She is an inspiration to unqualified people everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now it's the all-important background check into Harriet Miers, and I'm thinking, 'Oh, I hope they don't find out about our weekend in Atlantic City, because that was Katie-bar-the-door.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harriet is the...I think she is the most controversial Supreme Court pick since, well, since George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security was beefed up in the subway system in New York again today. Not because of terrorist threats. Yankee fans were throwing themselves in front of a train.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That security scare in the New York city subway turned out to be nothing. Turned out to be a hoax. In fact, officials now say it is now okay to go back to your usual, normal, everyday fear of riding the subway. The stabbings, the muggings -- whew! Thank God things are back to normal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI says they're now considering relaxing their drug policy on new applicants that want to join the FBI. If you smoke marijuana, it's ok. You thought the FBI was losing stuff before -- oh, my gosh. How bad will it be when they're high on weed now? So much for the war on drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the FBI's new policy. If you can't beat them, join them, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI will not hire you if you smoked pot more than 15 times in your life. Not today. You cannot join if you smoke marijuana more than 15 times. But the good news -- you can still be President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do they come up with this? Who picked the number 15? I mean, after a guy smoked dope 8, 10 to 13 times, it's pretty obvious that he likes it, right? A lot of stoners going, 'Oh, this is my 14th joint. No more for me, dude. I'm joining the FBI.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harriet Miers -- you know, the Supreme Court nominee -- she told the New York Times President Bush is the most brilliant man she knows, and Vice President Dick Cheney, the greatest athlete she's ever met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Newsweek reports that President Bush likes Harriet Miers because she didn't go to an Ivy League school, she worked hard and she's achieved everything on her own without family help. So, see that, opposites attract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest rumor is, she has so few supporters that her nomination will be withdrawn. They're saying they're gonna withdraw it. They think Bush may have to go to the woman who has had more courtroom experience. You know, like Courtney Love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, we celebrated Columbus Day. Did you know Columbus died penniless? Did you know this? He died completely broke. You know what happened? Before he returned to Spain, he stopped off at an Indian casino, lost everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, there's terrible flooding in New Hampshire. It's been declared a disaster area. To give you an idea how white New Hampshire is, FEMA got there in a minute and a half. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman from New Orleans who lost her house in Hurricane Katrina hit the $1.6 million slot machine jackpot at the casino in Louisiana. And here's the amazing part. Within an hour of her winning, Federal officials were down there, giving her tax forms to fill out. Huh? Where were these people when her house got washed away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Hillary Clinton was inducted into the national Women's Hall of Fame. Quite an honor. However, she is still not in Bill Clinton's women's hall of fame. In fact, she's not even in the top ten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's official. The new James Bond is actor Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig is the new James Bond. Even Harriet Miers is going, 'Who's Daniel Craig?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Bill and Hillary Clinton. It's their 30th wedding anniversary today. Bill showed up at the scene of his wedding with former President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was nice. Last night, Bill put together a lovely anniversary celebration. It was a quiet, candlelight dinner for two at a beautiful seaside hotel. And I don't know where Hillary was but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard this late-breaking bulletin. Earlier today, President Bush has pledged to rebuild the Yankees no matter what the cost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is denying a report from the BBC that claims that President Bush said God told him to invade Iraq. Yeah. He's denying it. President Bush denied the report and said, 'That's not true. I invaded Iraq because Batman told me to.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest approval ratings are out. Not good for President Bush. Not looking good. Yeah, yeah. According to the latest poll, he's now two points below the bird flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty frightening, this bird flu thing. This is scary. In fact, they say one of the symptoms of the bird flu, if you find yourself going to the bathroom on the windshield of your car -- that's a sign you may have the bird flu.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like that whole New York subway terrorist threat thing was a big hoax. President Bush, he was very upset about this. He says, 'What? You mean all this action taken and there were no weapons found?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real story is, an informant in Baghdad made up the whole story. But authorities say they bought it, because the story was so well constructed, it involved a number of believable characters, and the whole thing seemed so real. In fact, today NBC contacted this informant. They said, 'Have you got any other stories?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, that more and more Iraqis are able to take the fight to the enemy. The problem, the enemy is more and more Iraqis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a scathing new book, former FBI chief Louis Freeh criticizes former President Bill Clinton's 'moral compass.' You all remember Bill Clinton's moral compass, don't ya? I believe it was always pointing north, if I'm not mistaken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We joke, but last night was the Clintons'30th wedding anniversary. How about that? I was thinking about that. You know what keeps these two together? Spite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush and the First Lady were on the Today Show, building a house for Katrina victims. Before construction, they gave President Bush a set of plans. And, of course, he asked if he could keep them. Because, as you know, Bush has never had a set of plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Dick Cheney saw them building the house, Cheney was furious. He said, 'Hey, you're taking jobs away from Halliburton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, taking more liberal positions. Like global warming. Remember, he used to be against global warming? Well, now it's the Republican plan for heating homes this winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled this week that a witch, a witch in Chesterfield County, Virginia, cannot say an opening prayer at government meetings. This, of course, would be a ground-breaking decision for the year 1683.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, you probably know this, she told the New York Times that George Bush was the most brilliant man she ever met. Which is kind of scary. I mean, she only has one known opinion, and that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's what we know about Miers. You know, they've been investigating her. She's never been married, and she has no known boyfriends. In fact, today President Bush announced a very ambitious plan to put a man on Miers by the year 2010.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, it's raining again. It's rained every day for last week and a half. It's just crazy. Rain keeps coming down and coming down and coming down. To give you an idea how much rain we've had in New York City, we are this close -- this close -- to being ignored by FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have a brand-new James Bond, a new James Bond. Daniel Craig is the new James Bond. That's exciting, like the tenth or 12th James Bond. Democrats are upset. They're accusing him of being a Bush crony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has launched two guys into space. Were you aware of that? This week. Two guys from China are flying around in space. The mission, they hope to visit each planet and leave takeout menus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately, President Bush has been accused of being slow to react, so he's not laying down on this Chinese space program. When he heard the Chinese put two men into space, he says, 'By God, I plan to put a man on Harriet Miers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Thoughts Going Through George W. Bush's Mind At This Moment [While list was read, viewer was shown a photo of Bush 'in Covington, Louisiana, helping out with Habitat for Humanity and building a new home for those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.]: 10.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. This is, of course Yom Kippur. Do you say 'Happy Yom Kippur?' I guess you do. It kind of did feel like the al Jazeera network around here today, no Jewish writers. I don't know what happened.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that last night, the White Sox-Angels game? Horrible. Even Harriet Miers said, 'Is this the most qualified umpire we can find?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush getting a lot of grief from conservative Republicans over Harriet Miers' lack of legal opinions, which is kind of surprising. A woman without any opinions? That's the Republican's dream, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is being accused of cronyism. That means, you know, picking longtime friends and family for important jobs. See, that's one thing about Bill Clinton, you couldn't accuse him of cronyism. Like, when he wanted a sex partner, he went to strangers 'cause he knew if he went to his wife...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore said this week he is ruling out ever running for president again. He said he has no desire to ever again be a presidential candidate. So sounds like he might have had a bad experience in the past.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he figured he won once, what the hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech earlier this week at Harvard University, Bill Clinton said he has no idea if Hillary will run for president, but he said if he ever sees her again, you know, he'll ask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Bush building those houses on the 'Today' show this week? You know, I got a little confused when I saw President Bush standing there with the tool belt and the drill and the hat. I thought, 'Oh my God, what part of Katie Couric are they examining today?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. President Bush taking his bird flu very seriously. In fact, today he came out with these 'War on Bird Flu' playing cards. There is the rooster right there. That's the Ace of Spades. Of course you got the parrot right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey being called a hero. You hear about this? It's pretty amazing. Two women who watch Oprah have won $50,000 awards from Oprah for helping the FBI catch a convicted sex offender that she profiled on her show. You heard of Oprah's Book Club? This is the Oprah's 'Book 'em Club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Director Spike Lee is coming out with a documentary about the Hurricane Katrina disaster. I believe it's called 'Hustle and Float.' I believe that's the new name for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was raining so hard down in Washington, DC, that Tom DeLay didn't have to launder his money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, this is interesting, only 2% of African-Americans think that President Bush is doing a good job. 2%. Yeah. Probably the percentage would have been higher, but Condoleezza Rice has a small family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lost manuscript by the composer Ludwig von Beethoven has been discovered, and it's gonna be sold for over $1 million. Absolutely. Yeah. When he heard that Beethoven had written a manuscript, President Bush said, 'Man, that dog can do anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has declared war on this bird flu. He is quite serious. In fact, he's so serious about it, this Thanksgiving he says he might not pardon the White House turkey.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some scary news out of Seattle announcing Bill Gates may have caught the nerd flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, corporations are already responding to this bird flu scare. Like Kentucky Fried Chicken. The bucket now says 11 herbs and spices plus 5 antibiotics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy said, today, even if Hillary Clinton runs for president, if she decides to run, he will still support John Kerry for the Democratic nomination in 2008.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former vice presidential candidate John Edwards has taken a job on Wall Street. He is with a prestigious private investment firm on Wall Street. Remember him, John Edwards? He's the guy who always talked about the two Americas. Well, I guess we know which America he picked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently not a lot of job openings in that other America. Apparently Burger King not hiring this month, so, forced to go to Wall Street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush not looking good. His ratings are down to 38, 38. That is lower than Dick Cheney's pulse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His approval rating is so low, he's actually eligible for FEMA assistance now. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, among African-Americans, President Bush's approval rating, 2%. You know who the 2% are? Condoleezza Rice and Clarence Thomas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's pretty bad, isn't it? 2%. Whew, man. Do you realize, more people went to see 'Dukes of Hazard' than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what you call a Republican with only 2% of the black vote? A Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, right over here in Pasadena, just announced they're laying off 100 people. From the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to researchers at Duke University, walking 12 miles a week improves cardiovascular health. You know what you call people who walk 12 miles a week now? SUV owners.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Oprah's offering $100,000 to anyone who turns in a sex offender. More bad news for the Minnesota Vikings, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you can sure tell its fall here, can't you? You get the feeling that it's fall? Down in Washington, DC, earlier today, Tom DeLay was in his front yard raking indictments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Germans have their first female chancellor. I'm thinking, you know, the Germans have become really, really enlightened, or maybe they're up to something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they had the Iraqi elections over the weekend. I saw an interesting piece of tape. It's a Sunni leader giving a press conference.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to his lawyer, Saddam Hussein is spending his time waiting for his trial writing poetry and Romance novels. He's also written some plays.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's top assistant, Karl Rove, testified before the grand jury for the fourth time. This is the fourth time he's testified for the grand jury.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lynne Cheney said today, her husband, Vice President Dick Cheney, will not be a candidate for president in 2008.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest approval ratings, only 39% of Americans like the job President Bush is doing. 39%.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things have been going so badly for the President lately, his aides have even recommended adopting some of Clinton's old policies. Yeah, yeah. But to his credit, Bush said, no, he will not start dating again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Harriet Miers called President Bush the most brilliant man she's ever met. Now you know why she keeps her opinions to herself, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich said there are circumstances where he would run for president in 2008 and be elected. I believe those circumstances include hell and freezing over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What could be more fun than going to a rock concert with Hillary Clinton, huh? Except maybe going to a disco with Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Orleans, they welcomed the first baby born in a hospital since Hurricane Katrina. How about that? They named the baby FEMA because it finally showed up after nine months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI, loosening up. They're changing their policy on agents who have used drugs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush has declared a war on pornography. Well, thank God, a war on pornography. You know what I'm looking forward to?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they are still hunting down terrorists and over the weekend in Iraq they arrested the al Qaeda barber.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had to be very careful with al Qaeda's barber because if you say just a little off the top, he takes your head off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you folks have been following the new Chinese space program.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to US News &amp; World Report -- this is not the tabloids, this is US News &amp; World Report -- there's a breaking news flash, the rumors are flying, Vice President Dick Cheney might resign. He might resign. Oh man, whose going to be President now? Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever you think of this war, the Iraqi elections look pretty successful. Turnout was about 63%. That's high. 63%. You know, for an election in kind of turnout, it would have to be pretty big. It would have to be Clay versus Reuben or Carrie versus Vo, it would have to be something of that magnitude to get that much interest, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon is reporting that we have captured Osama bin Laden's barber. Did you hear that? We captured his barber. They're interrogating him right now to find out what he knows. In fact, they say we're this close to finding out what that blue stuff is they soak the combs in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial of Saddam Hussein getting under way in Iraq. The E! Channel is going to re-create the trial every night using professional actors. The part of Saddam would be played by Bea Arthur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security director Michael Chertoff announced that he plans to expel every illegal immigrant in this country. More bad news for the New York Yankees, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what [Chertoff] said on Capitol Hill today. He said when it comes to illegal immigration, he's working to end the Bush Administration's snatch and release policy. That's the snatch and release policy. That's what they call it. Which sounds like something left over from the Clinton Administration, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has begun his war on pornography, and not a moment too soon. That's what's wrong with this country! It's not the gas, it's not the floods. Let me tell you something, when the people using pornography are the enemy, they are difficult to find. Because instead of acting in groups, they mostly work alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sukkot is tonight. I guess this celebrates the Jewish people wandering without a home, or having no place to live, and they wandered for like 40 years. So apparently they had FEMA back then, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're aware of this or not but China now has a space program. They had a couple of astronauts in space for a week and they just returned from space. It was a tough trip. On reentry the ship heated up to four asterisks. That's right. Extra spicy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one of the Chinese astronauts whose name is Knee High Sheng -- he uttered the now famous words, one small step, one double order barbecue rib for mankind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, ladies and gentlemen. US forces in Iraq captured al Qaeda's barber. They also confiscated his shoulder-mounted blow dryer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're still waiting now for the results of the Iraqi election and the Sunnis, the Sunnis are now saying that the vote was rigged. The Sunnis are unhappy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein is going on trial tomorrow. He's accused of 143 murders, but he actually did get a break today. The prosecutors dropped the two counts of stealing satellite TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Saddam's trial begins, he will be the first ruthless cold blooded dictator to stand trial since Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow in Iraq, Saddam Hussein's trial finally begins and one Iraqi said, 'We hope we see Saddam cut to pieces and spread among the families.' To show you how bad things are, that was one of Saddam's lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, speaking of Iraq, Iraq held an election to approve their constitution. Some Iraqis claim the voting was fixed and the provinces of Nineveh and Diyala, which, by the way, are the Iraqi words for Ohio and Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the US government announced it would not accept more than 300,000 meals donated to Hurricane Katrina victims by the British.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein went on trial today. I didn't even know he worked the Bush White House, did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the strange part about the trial. Today, Amber Frye flew to Baghdad to testify. So I don't know what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial has begun, and Saddam's lawyers say they will accept any judge, except Harriet Miers. They don't feel she's qualified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Saddam's lawyers are asking for a three-month delay the trial. And of course, the judge doesn't want to grant it, because in Iraq, judges only have a life span of two months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, Saddam Hussein may have killed over a million people. Of course, the tobacco companies are not impressed. 'Amateurs!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam is 68 years old. In fact, he is the first senior citizen ever charged with murder here, that did not star in 'Beretta,' did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunnis are &quot;claiming there was voter fraud -- voter fraud in Iraq's election, over the weekend. That's according to the news agency 'Al Gore-zeera.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with Bono from U2 today. The press secretary said the lunch was a follow-up to the talks Bush and Bono had at the G8 summit about relieving African debt. You remember that?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has declared war on the bird flu. But you know, see, I don't think President Bush learns from his mistakes. Like today, he made a big speech at a bird sanctuary, in front of a banner that said, 'Mission Accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, Americans are becoming more and more rude. They're becoming ruder. You think that's true? Give you an idea how rude we've become, the French are starting to like us now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush's &quot;approval rating is at an all-time low, 39 percent, President Bush's approval rating. He's in such disfavor, most Americans...most Americans would like to replace him with Geena Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea about how bad George Bush's approval rating is, more people actually approve of the job I'm doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, a strange, fascinating woman. This woman steadfastly refuses to talk about herself. Will not talk about herself, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Well, hell, where do you find a woman like that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein's trial began today, and during the proceedings, Saddam refused to identify himself. Yeah, luckily everyone recognized him from that time he ran the country for 25 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein's trial was televised live and, of course, many Iraqis were glued to their TV sets. Yeah. Mainly, because years ago, Saddam had them glued to their TV sets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Jersey, legislators are trying to pass a bill that would ban smoking while driving a car. Yeah. The lawmakers say if New Jersey drivers want to inhale polluted air, they should just roll down the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you remember when you were in school and you didn't know the answer to a question, so you would, like, talk around the question? President Bush did it today, beautifully. Here is he responding to a question about Harriet Miers. Harriet Miers filled out a questionnaire, and here's President Bush responding to a question about her questionnaire.&quot; President Bush: &quot;The questionnaire that she filled out is an important questionnaire, and obviously they will address that the senators have in the questionnaire as a result to the answers to the questions in the questionnaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff says he wants to expel all illegal immigrants from the United States, which would reduce the population of Los Angeles to 142 people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush spent the day having lunch at the White House with Bono from U2. Did you see that in the news? As you know, Bono -- this is true. He's an economic expert.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda is now looking to hire people for video production. Isn't this unbelievable? The al Qaeda network, they need new people. Apparently the last two guys they hired had short fuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They won't let Saddam Hussein &quot;wear a belt or shoelaces because they're afraid he might try to kill himself. Die before we execute him. So they want to make sure...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the trial, Saddam Hussein insisted he is still president, he is still in charge despite the fact that his people disapprove of him, and his top assistants are all in jail, or going it jail. Oh, I'm sorry, that's President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, obese women who lose weight will see improvement in the quality of their sex lives. And today former President Clinton dismissed the findings as junk science.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Saddam Hussein's trial began yesterday. Are you aware of that? In court he stubbornly insisted that he is still the president. He was defiant. He said, 'I am still the president, you know, a little like Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a press conference today, President Bush said that he and Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers 'share the same judicial philosophy.' Yeah. When asked what that philosophy was, Bush said, 'He who smelt it, dealt it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury selection&quot; for Saddam Hussein's trial &quot;has already begun. And everybody was there for the jury selection in the courtroom, Saddam was there, his attorneys were there, Chemical Ali was there. And he brought his wife, Chemical Betty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was taking an active role in the Saddam Hussein trial. Earlier today he appointed an unqualified judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Karl Rove, presidential adviser and buddy Karl Rove? Apparently the brains in the White House. Well, he may be forced to resign, Karl Rove. Yeah. Insiders say that if Karl Rove resigns, President Bush would not function effectively. And I'm thinking, 'Wait a minute, all this time he's been functioning effectively? Is that possible?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reports that morale is so bad at the White House, that Vice President Dick Cheney has been giving the staff pep talks. Yeah. You know things are bad when Dick Cheney is the most cheerful guy in the room!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those hurricanes? Aren't they awful? Had another one over the weekend. So far, the United States has had eight hurricanes this season, that's crazy, isn't it? And they've run out of names for hurricanes so now they go to letters in the Greek alphabet. And after that it's the names of Larry King wives.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy. But the US has been hit eight times. The good news is next week is a bye week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that Tom DeLay, did you see that Tom DeLay down there in Texas where they arrested the guy and took his mug shot? Did you see the mug shot. Oh my God. And they say now he has had his teeth capped, Tom DeLay. His eyelids have been lifted. His hair was dyed. I mean honest to God, for a minute the Feds thought they had arrested Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is not doing well now. According to insiders, President Bush is peevish, melancholic, and blames others. No, wait a minute. Or is that me? I'm confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But seriously, they say Bush is angry. They say he is frustrated and they say that he is bitter. I can't imagine why. Everything is going so smoothly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Halloween, everybody. You know something? I am not going trick-or-treating 'til Wednesday. You know why? I'm going as a FEMA worker.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today, Americans spent $4 billion on Halloween this year. Isn't that amazing? $4 Billion. Stem cell research, we can't afford. Candy corn, hey, no problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three kids come to my house dressed as Bush, Cheney and Condoleezza Rice. They looked cute. I gave them some candy. They kept standing there. And I said, 'Okay, you can go.' They said, 'Oh, we can't. We don't have an exit strategy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is kind of sad. Did you see what Harriet Miers dressed up as tonight? A Supreme Court justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush nominated Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. Judge Alito has a lot more experience than Harriet Miers. Then again, Judge Reinhold had a lot more experience than Harriet Miers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush was asked how he came up with a conservative like Alito. And Bush said he got the idea over the weekend while turning the clocks back, then he realized...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, over the weekend, people at the White House set their clocks back to Watergate, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Setting the clocks back means what? Of course, the nights are getting longer. Yeah, more bad news for Scooter Libby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, Vice President Cheney's chief aide, Scooter Libby, indicted for perjury. But Karl Rove wasn't. So that's one scooter and one skater. So that's pretty interesting. One scooter, one skater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something -- this is not good. When you go to prison, it's not a good idea to be a white guy named Scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, the big question now is, 'What did President Bush know and when was it explained to him?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest survey, gas prices have been coming down faster than 'Go Astros' signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the price of gas in LA has dropped about 25 cents a gallon in the last week or two. Now down to $2.78. You remember $2.78 a gallon? That's the price we were mad about six months ago. Now we're going, 'Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for $2.78.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan -- you know that woman, there? She was protesting down there in Texas. She said she would tie herself up at the White House to get President Bush's attention. She'd tie herself up. Right idea, wrong president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that was more Bill's kind of thing. 'Help!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was Halloween yesterday. You know what the holiday is in Mexico today? Anybody know? Day of the Dead, right? Isn't that what it means? You know what this is? This is a holiday where people from Mexico celebrate all the departed souls that are now living in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had one kid show up at my door wearing this really expensive suit. Some kind of Italian suit, really expensive suit. Had all these expensive jewelry on, watches. I said, 'What are you supposed to be? Like a rapper?' He said, 'No, I'm an oil company executive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more members of Congress are calling for a tax on the huge profits being made by the oil companies. I mean, obscene, billions and billions of dollars. And, of course, Congress is very angry about this. Because even though the oil company profits are up, you know their bribes have all remained the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For first time the White House did not answer the door for trick-or-treaters last night. Not terrorism. They were just afraid it might be somebody with a subpoena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, I saw some pretty frightening costumes. I saw this one ghoul and this one goblin on the news getting off an airplane. Then I realized it was just Prince Charles and Camilla coming here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a poll in USA Today says 59% of Americans are not at all interested that Prince Charles is here visiting. Why should we be interested? Another foreigner without a job coming to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's the latest poll, if George Bush ran for president today, he would lose to the Democratic candidate. And today, President Bush said, 'Again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm sure you know Dick Cheney's chief of staff, 'Scooter' Libby -- I don't know. ... Well, anyway, he had to resign after being charged with perjury. Pretty bad, yeah. Cheney said he accepted Libby's resignation with a heavy heart that was also clogged and defective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did Scooter Libby say when he bumped into President Bush at the White House? 'Pardon me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, though, they think he's looking at jail time. This special prosecutor, he is supposed to be a really tough, tough guy. At one point in Friday's press conference, the prosecutor compared Scooter Libby to a baseball player. He said, 'In the White House, he was like the pitcher.' That's what they said. Of course, in jail, he'd be like the catcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both President Bush and Dick Cheney made speeches about Iraq this week. That's when you know things are bad, when the White House wants to get our minds back on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush nominated Circuit Court Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. Bush said Alito was the best, most qualified person for the job this week. And Harriet Miers, remember her? Remember her? She got a new job today. She's now host of VH-1's 'Where Are They Now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush was at the National Institutes of Health where he spoke about combating the bird flu. This bird flu. And he was pretty serious. He said we should all go about our regular business. He said if we stop eating eggs, that means the birds have won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this bird flu? They say this is the biggest threat to human health since the McNugget. That's what they're saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese government said today if bird flu strikes there, they will close and seal their borders. They will close their country. That's what they said, yeah. I get the feeling the Mexican government won't be quite so panicky about it. They're gonna take a wait and see attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting survey. 54% of lawyers said they would not represent a terrorist. 54%. The other 46% said they would represent a terrorist, but only as a professional courtesy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Judge Alito's confirmed -- this is an interesting fact -- if he's confirmed, there will be two sitting Supreme Court justices from New Jersey. Very good. Yeah. Experts say this could cause a reversal in the famous New Jersey case ? 'Mullet versus Back Hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Bush met with Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy. Yeah. There was one awkward moment when President Bush asked, 'When does the sixth season of the Sopranos start?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what he's calling his bird flu attack? 'Flock and Awe.' That's what we're calling it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, this bird flu is pretty scary. See, this shows you how times have changed. Remember when you'd give someone with the flu chicken soup? Well, now the chicken in the soup can give you the flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he wants to stockpile enough vaccine to protect 20 million Americans. Of course, the other 260 million Americans who aren't millionaires, you're on your own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said today he wants to spend something like $7 billion on a vaccine for this bird flu. In a related story, Halliburton said, 'We're in the vaccine business.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush really understands this bird flu. Like, one reporter asked him today if he's inoculated, and Bush said, 'Hey, I haven't had a drink in 20 years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was a scary moment in Washington, DC, yesterday, when a man with a knife was arrested in a park right across the street, a couple hundred yards away from the White House, after he slashed four people. Luckily, no one was seriously injured, and the Secret Service said the incident was 'not terrorist-related.' Well, thank God for that, huh? Luckily, he was a just a crazy guy across the street from the White House with a knife, stabbing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, Prince Charles and Camilla visited President Bush at the White House. One embarrassing moment, Bush said to Prince Charles, 'Hey, you didn't tell me you were bringing your mom!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot of criticism about Prince Charles visiting President Bush. Some people say all he does is wave while other people do the real work. He didn't deserve the job, he only got it 'cause of his parents. And then, of course, there's criticism of Prince Charles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like a big battle brewing in the Senate over Bush's Supreme Court nominee, Samuel Alito. You know, this judge. Bush says the reason he chose Alito was because he did such a good job at the OJ trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is spending millions of dollars to study psychic teleportation. You know what that is? That's the ability to move yourself from location to location by just using mind power. You know, as if Americans aren't fat and inactive enough as it is. Now you go from lying on the couch watching TV all the way to sitting on the john without taking a step?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during yesterday's elections, the city of Denver voted to legalize marijuana possession. 53% of the people approve of having marijuana in Denver, how about that? How does that make Bush feel? He's 14% behind pot now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day in Washington. That's right. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla flew to Washington DC today to meet with President Bush and the first lady. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Unfortunately, during a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn, Camilla got frightened, bolted and jumped over a fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a press conference this week -- this is weird -- a journalist asked President Bush what he carried in his pockets, and Bush showed him that all he had was a handkerchief. Yeah. Or as President Bush calls it, his 'booger motel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in the Philippines are charging the environmental group Greenpeace $7,000 because one of Greenpeace's boats destroyed a coral reef. Yeah. Greenpeace says it will pay the fine by selling off its collection of rare ivory.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today -- this is pretty serious ? if there is an outbreak of bird flu, they could restrict air travel. Americans will not be allowed to go anywhere except, of course, Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bird flu is even having an effect on Thanksgiving. Like, you see what the folks at Stovetop are doing? Hand me that. Saw it in the store today. This is Stovetop dressing. Can you see it? 'Now with Tamiflu.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush put his plan into effect for avoiding bird flu in this country, he left for Argentina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you ever seen the special plane he uses when he flies to South America? Show his plane there. Air Force Juan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A reporter from Argentina who is interviewing President Bush asked what he carried around with him. 'What he do you keep with you at all times?' And Bush stood up, emptied his pockets and the only thing he had was a handkerchief. Then they asked Vice President Dick Cheney to empty his pockets, and three oil lobbyists fell out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Senator named Charles Grassley, has written to the oil companies asking them to donate a portion of their nearly $100 billion, not million, $100 billion in profits, to help low income people buy heating oil this winter. And the oil companies responded by offering millions of dollars to someone to run against Grassley in the next Republican primaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more details coming out on Supreme Court nominee Sam Alito. Sam Alito. Doesn't that sound like something you get after eating undercooked chicken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know he's a conservative. But they say in college -- this is what was in the paper today -- he led a student conference to legalize sodomy and oral sex. Well, that should get some of the Democrats behind him, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Scooter Libby appeared in court on crunches recovering from a foot injury from when he put his foot in his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just when you thought things couldn't get any uglier at the White House, yesterday, Prince Charles and Camilla showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Prince Charles also known as the Prince of Wales, which I believe was also Clinton's nickname, wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince Charles is here in the United States trying to promote trans-Atlantic trade, and Camilla is here trying to get on 'The Swan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one kind of embarrassing moment when Prince Charles and Camilla showed up and President Bush turned to his wife Laura and whispered, 'Which one is Prince Charles?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news tonight that Camilla brought 57 dresses with her on this trip. 57. That's ten more than Prince Edward brought on his last trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince Charles said that he wants to sit down with President Bush and negotiate a settlement whereby we would have to take back Madonna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To stop illegal immigration, a plan has been introduced to build a giant fence, a huge fence along the US-Mexican border. They want to build a huge fence. Some advice for illegal aliens, you might want to be standing on this side while you're building the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To draw attention to one of his ballot measures, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he rode a bus from here in the Valley -- rode a bus from the Valley all the way down to Long Beach. It was huge news out here. Huge news. Sure, how often do you see a Republican riding a bus? That never happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of NASA said the United States cannot afford to go to the moon alone any more. He said this. The cost is too great for one country to bear. How depressing is that? Gas is so expensive we have to car pool to the moon now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what's being called a stunning breakthrough, IBM has developed a silicone chip that can slow down the speed of light. Imagine that? Actually slow down the speed of light. It's based on FEMA technology they say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sylvester Stallone has agreed to star in the fourth Rambo movie. There you go. This will be filmed in the United States and Mexico so apparently Rambo takes on a Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday, by the way, is Election Day here in New York City. Tuesday is Election Day. Please, don't forget to vote. A lot of important proposals being voted on, on Tuesday. For example, proposal number two and that would increase the fine for homicides to $75. Really going to be a money maker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to First Lady Laura Bush, 59 years old tomorrow. And you know President Bush says that marrying Laura was the best decision he ever made. And, well, that's not hard to believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Bush met with Prince Charles and his wife Camilla. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Yeah. There was one awkward moment when Bush told Prince Charles, 'Hey your mom looks even older than my mom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say that because President Bush has been having so much trouble with domestic issues his advisors are urging him to focus on international issues. Good advice, yeah. As a result, today the President had breakfast at the International House of Pancakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Vice President Dick Cheney's former assistant, Scooter Libby, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Yeah. The weird thing is since his name is Scooter he's being tried in juvenile court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Bush announced his plan for fighting the bird flu. The bad news, there's just enough vaccine for the red states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is now in South America. In fact, when he landed, he said, 'Oh, my God, John Edwards is right, there are two Americas. I can't believe this. North and South.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was greeted by 10,000 demonstrators shouting, 'Get out, Bush, get out, Bush.' And that was here at the airport before he left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is in Argentina right now for the American trade summit. They're having riots. They are rioting down there. I haven't seen the people of Argentina this angry since Madonna played Evita.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political analysts, they say this is an attempt by President Bush to try and improve his image by becoming more involved in foreign matters. Isn't that what got him in trouble in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's popularity here at home has slipped to 35%. It is so low he might get his own show right here on NBC.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, there was a big state dinner the other night at the White House for Britain's royal couple. Very big affair, you know -- when President Bush entered the room, they played 'Hail To The Chief.' Then when Prince Charles walked in, they played 'God Save The Queen.' Then when Camilla walked in, they played 'Back In The Saddle Again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in court yesterday, 'Scooter' Libby, 'Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, pled not guilty and then accidentally blurted out the name of three other CIA agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, outside the courthouse 'Scooter' Libby's lawyer said all he wants to do is clear his client's good name. I don't know, 'Scooter', is that a good name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Jersey governor's race &quot;is just a dirty campaign. The Republican candidate is showing ads featuring the Democrat's ex-wife attacking him. And the Democrat is allegedly spreading rumors that the Republican had on affair with the former Miss New Jersey. Remember the more innocent times in New Jersey when all you had to worry about was a crooked, gay governor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laura Bush is 59 years old. And did you realize this, that she used to be a librarian? And I'm thinking well, how the Hell did these two get together?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported this week that when he was in college, Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito supported gay rights. Yeah. See, apparently, his exact words were, 'Let's get Jen and Stacey drunk and see if they make out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty scary trip for President Bush when he went down to South America. Did you see them throwing Molotov cocktails everywhere he went? Or as the White House spin doctors called it, a warm welcome. He got a warm welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Bush's people are considering the trip a huge success. 'Cause while he was gone, nobody else got indicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woo! Not looking good for President Bush's popularity. It's now at 35%. If he drops just three more points, he becomes a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have seen on the news, Vice President Dick Cheney's now-indicted chief of staff, Scooter Libby -- see him walking around on crutches? Apparently, he hurt his foot taking that fall for Karl Rove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, while all this is going on, all these indictments, President Bush has now ordered everyone in the White House to attend ethics classes. Woo, not a moment too soon on that one. Now, you thought FEMA was late?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has voted 51-48 to allow drilling for oil in ANWR, Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. They're gonna drill for oil up there. But President Bush says it's a good thing that passed, 'cause if it hadn't have passed, we would have had to, of course, invade Alaska. Liberate Alaska. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Senator Charles Grassley -- interesting man -- he has asked the oil companies to use some of the hundreds of billions of dollars of profits they made recently to help poor people buy home heating oil. See, that's when you know that you're making a lot of money. Okay, when Republicans start noticing, hey, wait a minute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the oil companies said they'd like to help the poor people, but they need that money, of course, to buy more senators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of Iraq -- Iraq is now planning to build a five-star hotel, plus a theme park, what they're expecting to be a future tourism boom. Boom being the key word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Prince Charles and Camilla toured hurricane damage in New Orleans. Did you see that? And I thought this was very nice. The city presented Prince Charles with a check for $3 million to help fix up Camilla. I thought that was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is now the 12th day of rioting in France. They've been rioting for almost two weeks. This is unbelievable. 12 days of rioting and France has still not surrendered. That's like a record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are so bad that France is now asking the Germans to come back in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, these rioters, they say they're upset because there are immigrants who have been treated poorly by the French. What? French people treating foreigners rudely? I can't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow here in New York City is election day, election day. And Mayor Bloomberg is so confident about being re-elected that earlier today he called Florida and cancelled the crooked voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about what is going on in France? 11 straight days of rioting. It's just been crazy. But President Bush said don't worry. And he's offered France the full use of FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And right now, George Bush is finishing up his big South American tour. And oh my God, there were protestors. There were demonstrations. Angry crowds. I mean he must have felt right at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this Scooter Libby thing. Yeah, exactly. A grown man named Scooter. And he's Dick Cheney's chief of staff. And he's been indicted. And I have not been following this too closely, you know, like the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about these riots in France? Did you see this? Over 1,300 cars were set on fire in France. 1,300. Usually, to see that many vehicles on fire, you gotta wait till the Detroit Pistons win a championship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about these riots in France? Did you see this? Over 1,300 cars were set on fire in France. 1,300. Usually, to see that many vehicles on fire, you gotta wait till the Detroit Pistons win a championship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. It is wet out there, isn't it? As you know, it rained last night on Governor Schwarzenegger's parade. Man! All his propositions got a 'No.' Every one a 'No.' You know, I don't think a politician's heard 'no' that many times since Bill tried to get into Hillary's bedroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the worst day for Arnold since the movie 'Jingle All the Way' came out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats did pretty good yesterday. Democratic Senator Jon Corzine, I think that's how you say his name. He won the governor's race in New Jersey, despite the fact -- I don't know if you saw these ads, but his ex-wife attacked him in TV ads. And he's also been accused of having a number of affairs. So at least he's a traditional Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas has voted to ban same-sex marriages. And since gays are now banned from getting married in Texas, this'll start a new battle cry in the gay community. 'Remember Al and Mo! Remember Al and Mo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love this. The five families are in Congress today. The chiefs of the five major oil companies defended their industry's huge profits before a congressional committee today. See, this gave oil executives a chance to put a face to the names they write the checks to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That had to be kinda awkward. Oil company executives and congressmen pretending like they didn't know each other. 'Why, hello, senator!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CEOs were asked why the day after Hurricane Katrina, the day after, they raised the price of gas 24 cents in 24 hours. And they said they tried to raise it more, but that's as fast as they could go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they made almost $100 billion in profits. Someone said to me today, 'No, you mean million.' No, billion! $100 billion in profits! In fact, the only way the oil companies could make more money is if while they were drilling for oil they struck Starbucks coffee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has now voted to allow drilling in the ANWR, that's the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge up there in Alaska. They're going to drill for oil up there. Proponents of drilling say it's possible to go after the oil without hurting, you know, the surrounding environment. Like we did in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this CIA torture scandal, this kind of thing going on. President Bush has denied, today, he denied any unlawful treatment of prisoners. He said, 'We do not torture, at least not in this country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has asked all the White House employees to take an ethics course. And Cheney's asked them to take CPR. So, they're trying to combine the two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All White House employees, by a direct order of the President, will have to take a refresher course on ethics. See, I don't know how serious they are about this ethics. You know who's teaching the course? Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not even a course. It's a seminar being held in Vegas, and Halliburton is picking up the tab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this rioting in France? Is that unbelievable? It's amazing how many cars have been destroyed. Rioters have now actually destroyed more cars than Lindsay Lohan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is getting worse. Today, President Chirac, the President of France, announced that the French are now pulling out of France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday here in New York City was Election Day, and it was fascinating, some of the proposals. New Yorkers voted on Proposition 8. You know what that is? Proposition 8 makes it illegal to shoot somebody in a library without a silencer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is in South Dakota. He went duck hunting, duck hunting, Vice President Cheney went duck hunting. Turns out there were no ducks. Turns out he got bad intelligence, bad intelligence.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from France? We have French folks here with us tonight? Have you heard about it, it's gone crazy, like two weeks of rioting. Every night, people go out and go crazy all over France. Over 600 cars were burned last night, 600 cars. But the good news is, the rioters saved about 15% by switching to Geico.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I saw -- the movie 'Get Rich or Die Trying' opened today. Do you know what it is about? It's about an oil company executive trying to get into the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heads of a top five oil companies went before Congress, to explain the huge profits that they've been making. Well, there is something the top brass on NBC will never have to worry about, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, when these oil company executives walked into the Capitol building, you could see a lot of the senators and congressmen were a little scared. You know? It's always nerve-racking, when the real owners of the place show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the price of gas has gone down -- for the fifth straight week, gone down. In fact -- listen to this. President Bush has called for an emergency cabinet meeting, to find out what in the hell went wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA is now investigating who leaked the story, that we have secret prisons in Europe. And they are furious about it. They say when they find the person who did it, they will send them to a secret prison in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Scooter' Libby, who got indicted, has set up a legal defense fund, to help pay his legal bills. It's pretty good. For a $1,000 donation, you get a handwritten thank-you note, and the name of current CIA agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as of today, former FEMA Director Michael Brown is finally off the government payroll. Two months? Huh? Two months? That shows you how slow FEMA is. They can't even fire someone quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barbara Streisand, now calling for the impeachment of President Bush. Although, Congress is holding off until they hear from Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;French police are now claiming that they have things under control. ... Three nights ago, 1,500 cars were burned. Two nights ago, 600 cars were burned. And last night, 400 cars were burned. Does that sound like it's under control? It sounds to me like they're running out of cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;France said today, they're going to deport all those foreigners who rioted. You know what that means? France is finally going to send people to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is now talk that either Warren Beatty or Rob Reiner will run against Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor. Well see, that gives California the real choice -- a romantic lead, sitcom star or action hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave Muhammad Ali the Medal of Freedom yesterday. Actually, you know something? It was a little sad. Because he was hard to understand. He wasn't making any sense. But Mohammed was very patient with President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks been following the difficulty in France? Night after night after night of rioting and looting and burning cars, but don't worry because the French government is working around the clock to figure out a way to blame it on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice, Dick Cheney, the Vice President, went duck hunting in South Dakota, and he wants to show despite the fact he has a heart condition, he's still able to bring down defenseless birds with a cannon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you know about it, there's nothing like shooting ducks and having a few beers with your lesbian daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's approval rating is down to 30%. Yeah. After hearing this, Arnold said I'm not going to act all hurt and upset because I don't have that kind of range.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Wednesday, President Bush met with the Dalai Lama. You, I know -- I don't think President Bush really knew who the Dalai Lama was. Like, he kept praising him for his fine work in the 'Karate Kid' movies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger left today for a trade trip to China. Governor Schwarzenegger went to -- see, this sums up California. A governor with an Austrian accent, speaking broken English to the Chinese, about creating new jobs for Mexican immigrants in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evangelist Pat Robertson has warned the town of Dover, Pennsylvania, not to be surprised if disaster strikes their town, because they fired their school board for trying to introduce that 'intelligent design' thing into the school. Yeah. He said don't be surprised if God strikes their town. When did Pat Robertson become God's mob enforcer all of a sudden?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, if God destroys Dover, Pennsylvania, what is he going to do to Vegas? Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner of a brothel in Las Vegas is offering soldiers who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan free sex with prostitutes over the holidays. What a lovely story that is. Well see, that's the difference between us and the enemy. See, al Qaeda, they might give you 72 virgins after you die. Here, you get your free whores right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Friday night, CBS has this tremendous hit show, have you seen it, 'Ghost Whisperer?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech earlier today, President Bush said that his opponents are rewriting the pages of American history. Yeah. Yeah, and what really makes him mad is, they're using big words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the new Newsweek poll, 34% of Americans think that Dick Cheney's been given too much power by President Bush. The other 66% believes that President Bush has been given too much power by Dick Cheney. It could go either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Russian scientist has created remote control turtles for spying missions. They're live turtles with cameras on their shells. And they send them out to look around. You know, we could use these in Iraq. This way the war would take even longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news that al Qaeda is now trying to recruit more women. Which makes you wonder, what do they promise women to get them to become terrorists? I mean, the guys get 72 virgins, right? You know what they promise a woman? One guy that's monogamous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Bill and Hillary Clinton are in Israel tonight. That's what the Middle East needs, two more people who are fighting over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is in town, ladies and gentlemen. He's trying to squeeze in as many fundraisers as he can before his indictment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York loves it when Dick Cheney is in town because he makes the rest of us seem friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor of Florida Jeb Bush announced he might run for president, because how many times have you thought to yourself, 'Gee, if we could only have just one more Bush in the White House?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But experts believe that Jeb Bush is actually a shoe-in because he owns all of the crooked voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on his Asian tour now. He'll visit Japan, South Korea, China, Mongolia. Once again, he's skipping Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating down to 37%. In fact, it's so low now, when he left on his Asian trip yesterday, the Marine band played, 'Hit the Road, Jack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Japan, which is unusual. It's strange. You know, to see an American President bowing down to people who aren't running an oil company. You know, it's so weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is in China today. He's in China. He didn't want to go. But it was one of those ballot issues the firemen and the nurses had backed. 'If you lose, I will have to go to China. I stay there and refuse to come back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore said over the weekend that global warming is more serious than terrorism. Unless, of course, the terrorist is on your plane. Then that extra half a degree doesn't bother you that much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas has gone down for the sixth straight week. That's certainly good news. It's gone down so much, White House staffers no longer have to car pool for their arraignments. They can all take their own vehicles now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has a brother Jeb, who is the Governor of the state of Florida. And Jeb now says that he would like to be president. Jeb Bush says he would like to be president, and I think I speak for all Americans when I say, 'When can you start, Jeb?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Paris, France, Osama bin Laden's brother -- is it Larry bin Laden? I'm not sure of the first name, but its Osama bin Laden's brother in France was arrested for money laundering. Yeah, I'm telling you, this is the kind of thing that could give the bin Laden family a bad name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Money laundering, and I believe it's the first time anyone in the bin Laden family has laundered anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Japan today, and the prime minister took Bush on a tour of the temple. There was an awkward moment at the temple when Bush told the Japanese prime minister, 'Funny, you don't look Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rioting continues in France. French President Jacques Chirac is asking his government to extend the national state of emergency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is on his tour of Asia. I think he's getting his cultures confused. Like, he landed in Japan, he got off Air Force One, he yelled 'Aloha' to the crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not looking good for President Bush. Approval rating dropped again. Now down to 37%. Now, when you're at 37%, is it still considered an 'approval rating?' Isn't it kind of a disapproval rating at this point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How unpopular President Bush is right now? On his flight to Japan on Air Force One, he had to sit in coach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said today in the paper, if Bush ran for president today, he would lose to Kevin Federline. Yeah. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is over in China right now. To give you an idea how far behind us the Chinese are. Do you know what Arnold's doing now? You know what he's doing? Opening a Planet Hollywood. Yeah, that's how far behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, during his speech, Arnold said ? 'China can change.' He said, 'China can change.' That's what he said. Then he introduced four new propositions that were soundly defeated by the Chinese people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House Drug Czar has introduced a new nationwide campaign to help in the fight against methamphetamines. There is a concern that we are losing the fight against these amphetamines. Well, you see why we're losing. I mean, the Drug Czar works, what, 9:00 to 5:00, five days a week, and these tweakers are working 24 hours a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is President Bush's brother Jeb Bush may run for president. May run? In fact, according to Florida voting machines, he's already won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists have developed a security camera that's mounted on turtles. Remember? We talked about this last night. And they put 'em on turtles, and they send the turtles in to observe. Or, as FEMA calls it, 'The Rapid Response Team.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an online survey by 'Men's Fitness' magazine, my Bible, 'Men's Fitness,' obviously. If American women could sleep with one politician, it would be Bill Clinton. What do you think of that? 34% of American women said they would like to go to bed with Bill Clinton. The other 66% already have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's a great deal of wildlife in the Northeastern part of the country. Last night I'm driving home, and I saw a deer in the middle of the road, and he had that Bush caught-in-the-headlights look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, President Bush is on an eight-day tour of Asia. He's visiting American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is &quot;spending eight days in the Orient, and as we all know we spent the last four years in dis-orient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Florida Governor, Jeb Bush, says he wants to be president. Well, that's a good idea. Somebody will have to pardon his brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, former President Clinton gave a speech in the Middle East, and he said that invading Iraq was a big mistake. Yeah. Now, in fact, Clinton called the war in Iraq 'President Bush's Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush was in Japan, which is called 'Land of the Rising Sun.' The day before, he was here in America, 'The Land of the Falling Poll Numbers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh man, approval rating all-time low. In fact, he is doing so poorly right now, he can't get a loan from Ditech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legendary Washington Post reporter, Bob Woodward, you know Woodward and Bernstein. Well, he admitted a top White House source leaked him the name of a CIA agent. And this has started more speculation that Dick Cheney May be forced to resign. You know who becomes -- you know what's interesting? This surprised me. Do you who know becomes vice president if Cheney resigns, anybody know? Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John Kerry said today, 'The war in Iraq was a huge mistake,' and he should know. He voted for it twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Democrats in Congress now are accusing President Bush of deliberately misleading them into voting for the war in Iraq. They say Bush deceived them. You see, I love how Democrats are always saying what a moron Bush is and nobody's listening to what he says. He's an idiot. And now they're going, 'Hee-hee, he tricked us.' Hey, wait a minute. How smart are you if he tricked you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pentagon, Iraq detained 83,000 terrorist suspects. 83,000. Enough to fill a football stadium. Isn't that amazing? You know what you call a football stadium full of terrorists in this country? Oakland Raiders game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball has now implemented their new steroid policy. The penalty's pretty severe. If you fail one test, 50 games suspension. Fail a second time, 100 games. Fail it three time, they make you a Dodger for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the bear hunting season opened up in New Jersey. ... But not everybody enjoys shooting bears. For example, Dick Cheney wants the CIA to torture them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are lashing out at their critics, lashing out at their critics. You know, I've tried that. Save your breath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush's brother, Jeb, who is the Governor of Florida, says he wants to run for president. And you can't blame him, because right now the Bush name is magic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il doesn't want his son to take over when he retires, because his son is 'too girlish.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, Republicans in Congress -- Republicans! -- are demanding that President Bush come up with an exit strategy for Iraq. Yeah. Today, Bush said, 'I have an exit strategy; I'm leaving office in 2008.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to curb illegal immigration, the United States -- have you heard about this? -- is considering building a giant fence along the US-Mexico border.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Al Gore's manager, Al Gore's manager from the 2000 presidential campaign is writing a book. Yeah. Yeah, the manager says he's rushing the book to print 'cause he wants to catch some of that Al Gore heat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian basketball league has begun recruiting American basketball players. Yeah. The Iranians are recruiting Americans. Yeah. The only drawback with the Iranian basketball league is if you steal the ball, they cut off your hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I don't think President Bush really knows a lot about China. Like today, he said he's really looking forward to going to the great mall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is bringing gifts to the Chinese leaders from America. That's what they need over there, more stuff made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are saying the reason President Bush went on this Asian trip was to take a break from the critics who say he manipulated the truth, misled the public and supports torture.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Schwarzenegger was in China this week. He just came back today. Arnold gave a speech in China where he said, 'China can change.' That's what he said. He said, 'China can change.' It was either that or 'Cheney is strange.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest poll, a majority of Americans think President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are not telling the truth. How ironic is that? Did you ever think you'd see the day when you missed the honesty of Bill Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Bill Clinton said today invading Iraq was a big mistake. He said the Administration's other big mistake -- not having an exit strategy. Say what you want about Clinton, he always had an exit strategy. It might have been the fire escape. It might have been the bedroom window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball reached an agreement with the players on a much tougher steroid policy. You know the new steroid policy? 50-game suspension for the first offense. Season-long suspension for second offense. And the third offense, by that time you're so big, nobody can do anything to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By God, it's almost Thanksgiving ladies and gentlemen. Earlier today, President Bush pardoned the White House turkey -- uh-huh. It was just a practice run for Scooter Libby.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're following the Saddam Hussein trial, you know, he's going on trial, and he has, like, 1100 lawyers. 1100 lawyers, and for one reason or another, because they've been getting killed off, I guess, they have withdrawn from the Saddam Hussein case, the 1100 lawyers. It's just unbelievable. But now, they're going to be working on Tom Cruise's prenup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito said he's embarrassed by some of the things he wrote in the 1980s. Yeah, yeah. It turns out Alito wrote the song 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Judge Alito, this week, liberal groups -- liberal groups launched a series of ads attacking Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush pardoned the White House turkey. Here's an interesting fact. Do you know how they pick the turkey that gets the presidential pardon? Anybody know? It's the one that gave the most money to Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turkey is given a police escort to the Washington airport. It's then flown to Los Angeles, first class. The turkey gets to be the grand marshal at the Disneyland Thanksgiving parade. No, definitely true. And then, after the festivities, the turkey will live the rest of his life in comfort at the Disneyland ranch. I bet the survivors of Hurricane Katrina are going, 'Great, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has returned from his Asian tour. Remember the old days, when Nixon opened the door to China? Now, we can't open a door in China, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in 'GQ,' 50 Cent -- you know, the rap artist, 50 Cent? You know, my man, 50 Cent. He's a big fan of President Bush. ... This increases President Bush's approval rating among African-Americans to one now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney says he's particularly upset, when critics say they lied us into the war. I say fine. Lie us back out. And we'll call it even.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of those great White House traditions. Every year this time, the President, President Bush pardoned the White House turkey. But this was only after Dick Cheney had the CIA torture it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then after the turkey was pardoned by President Bush, it was flown to an appearance down at Disneyland where it was trampled by a crowd of tourists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in China and you probably saw this. He tried to leave the press conference. Did you see that footage? And the door was locked. He can't get out. Out of habit, he says, 'What's going on in there, Jenna?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is &quot;the first American President ever that ever visited Mongolia. He heaped praise on the country. He said, 'Mongolia is my favorite city in Mexico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was on his trip, listen to this, the President saw dancers wearing elaborate masks, saw fury two-humped camels, a pair of white yaks. That's right. He's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush continued a longstanding Thanksgiving tradition by pardoning the White House turkey. Isn't that nice? Yeah, apparently, Dick Cheney was really upset, 'cause he wanted to torture the turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President Clinton told reporters that it would be a mistake for the US to pull out of Iraq. Yeah. Clinton's exact words were, 'Pulling out early would be a mistake, and you can write the rest of this joke yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they said in the paper today that recruitment was down in most branches of the military. Well, of course it's down. We're at war with Iraq. Who wants to go to Iraq? We should start a war in some place people want to go to like Cabo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Saddam in court yesterday? They said Saddam remained defiant and acted like he was still in power. You know, like the Democrats do over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little reminder for all you lobbyists, oil executives and defense contractors out there, only 26 more shopping days to buy a Congressman before Christmas. So remember that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard by now, California Congressman Duke Cunningham has resigned from office after admitting he broke the law by taking $2.4 million in bribes. Isn't that ironic? The only time you're sure a politician is telling the truth is when he's admitting he's a crook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine being considered too unethical for Congress? That's like a rat hair getting kicked out of a hot dog.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, many in Washington are saying they're very disappointed in Cunningham because he broke the most important rule of all in Congress, never admit guilt. D'oh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the bribes that Cunningham took was a yacht. Somebody gave him a yacht, and he called it 'The Dukester.' How stupid do you have to be to take a bribe with your name on it? It's got your name on it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You make $160,000 a year. You have a big yacht, a Rolls Royce. Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush was at the Mexican border yesterday. Apparently, his poll numbers are so low, I think he was trying to make a run for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he was giving a speech on illegal immigration. He's getting tough, cracking down. He said that people that cross the border illegally will be sent back to their own countries. You know what that means? Maybe our troops are coming home!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the speech was very effective. Did you see him when he said good-bye? Show him saying good-bye at the border. Take a look. Here he is. Here's the President. Now, watch what he does here. He waves. Ellen, can we see who he's waving to? See more people coming over. He waves again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today at the U.S. Naval Academy, President Bush released the White House strategy for winning the war in Iraq. Nice to know they didn't rush into that one, huh? 2 1/2 years later. What do you think? Maybe stuck in the copy machine? Paper jam, possibly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, in his speech, President Bush said 'we need to rebuild Iraq, we need to provide the people with hope, and give them jobs. And hey, if it works there, maybe we'll try it in New Orleans.' What do you think? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right after he finished the speech, the rebuttal was given by the Democratic leader, Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, the rebuttal was given by John Kerry. And then John Kerry asked for more time to give a rebuttal to his own rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Saddam Hussein back in court this week. Has a new defense strategy. Did you hear about this? New defense strategy. He's using the Florida teacher defense. He's now claiming he's too pretty to go to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The L.A. Times' reporting that the United States -- this is unbelievable. We are now paying Iraqi newspapers, we're giving them money to run stories secretly written by us about all the wonderful things the United States is doing in Iraq. You know, like establishing freedom of the press. You know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon unveiled a new weapon this week. It's the first ever hand held laser gun. Like 'Star Trek,' like, laser gun. It's about the size of a machine gun. It shoots a low-powered beam of laser light that blinds the enemy. Shoot the beam of light, and blind the enemy. Yeah. And they think this could easily defeat al Qaeda, unless, of course, they happen to have a hand mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what else? Here's a fun fact. It turns out the uniforms worn by our United States border guards are actually made in Mexico. Did you hear about this? True story today. How long do you think it will take the guys making the uniforms to figure out if they put one of these on, they could walk across the border and get a better job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big controversy in Washington over the Christmas tree. You know, we are so politically correct. For years it was called what? 'The Christmas tree.' But in recent years, we had to call it 'the holiday tree.' Well, now, Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, he wants to call it the Christmas tree again. And everybody has their own idea about what it should be called. Like president Bush, show the chart. President Bush wants to call it 'that big pointy greeny thingy with the shiny objects.' Vice President Cheney wants to call it 'one of those things we knock down to get oil.' Rumsfeld, he wanted to call it 'the divert attention away from the Iraq war tree.' You see the name they went with? Show the name they went with. 'Spruce Willis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hear about this down in Washington, a big huge chunk nasty huge, heavy, heavy chunk of marble fell off the Supreme Court building. Thank God Janet Reno was there and a one-handed catch she made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was actually a 200 pound chunk of marble. I believe it is the biggest thing to drop in Washington since Clinton's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is good news. The White House released a 35-page plan entitled 'Our National Strategy For Victory In Iraq.' 35 pages. It is called 'Our National Strategy For Victory In Iraq.' President Bush refuses to set a timetable for reading it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a speech on Iraq today. It went well. He was able to open the door and get out. So that was good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Top Ten New Strategies for Victory in Iraq: &quot;10. Make an even larger 'Mission Accomplished' sign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Encourage Iraqis to settle their feud like Dave and Oprah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Put that go-getter Michael Brown in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Launch new slogan, it's not 'Iraq' it's 'Weraq'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Just do whatever he did when he captured Osama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A little more vacation time at the ranch to clear his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Pack on a quick thirty pounds and trade places with Jeb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Wait, you mean it ain't going well?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Boost morale by doing his hilarious locked door gag.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not good news for President Bush. President Bush approval rating now down to 35%. I can't believe how unpopular President Bush is these days. You know, he wasn't even invited to the White House Christmas party?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you may have heard, President Bush has been called for jury duty in Texas. Finally, some good news for Tom DeLay, huh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I understand President Bush is calling his dad trying to get him out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Hillary Clinton has now called to President Bush to begin pulling troops out of Iraq next year. Let me tell you something. When it comes to telling the President when to pull out, no one has had more experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what the latest scandal in Iraq is. You may have heard about this. It seems the Pentagon has been paying Iraqi journalists to write and promote a pro-White House view in Iraqi newspapers. See, luckily we don't have that kind of thing here. We have Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has defended the White House position on detainees by saying, 'with terrorists, you can lock someone up even before they commit a crime.' How about trying this with Congressmen? Why don't we try this some time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We couldn't be prouder here in California. California Congressman Randy 'the Duke' -- well, soon to be the duchess when he goes to prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Randy Cunningham resigned his office after accepting $2.4 million in bribes. Amazing. Did you see him? He was crying and he said, 'I've known great joy and great sorrow.' Yeah, great joy when he got the million under the table. Great sorrow when he got caught. Boo-hoo-hoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now they're doing a movie about it. It is called 'get rich or resign trying.' And you know something? His office -- really trying to capitalize on it. Today, they just released this new Christmas catalog. It's 'things Congressman Cunningham won't be needing in prison.' You got the Rolls-Royce. You got the plane. You got the boat. You got the yachts. The whole deal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has hired a former member of Governor Gray Davis' staff, a woman named Susan Kennedy, to be his new chief of staff. I guess after all of those referendums were defeated, Arnold said, 'being a Republican didn't work. We'll try to use Democrats for a while. We'll see how far we get with that. We'll see if the people come forward.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah's on the program tonight for the first time since 1989, and I want to thank Jimmy Carter for negotiating the peace settlement. He did a wonderful job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, President Bush lit the national Christmas tree. Did you all see it? The tree has over 25,000 lights, one for every indicted member of the Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;President Bush is starting to talk tough now. In his speech at the Naval Academy the other day, he said, we will not leave Iraq until we've achieved our goals. He calls the plan, 'No oil barrel left behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said he is not afraid to go it alone. Believe me, if any more Republicans get indicted, he may have to at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's kind of a Freudian slip. Senator Orrin Hatch was on Fox News the other day, you know, talking about the whole situation. And he accidentally called Iraq Vietnam. Of course, huge difference between Iraq and Vietnam. See, Bush had a plan to get out of Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more problems for Randy 'Duke' Cunningham. You know who he is? He's the sleazeball congressman that took $2.4 million in bribes. You know he's an eight-term congressman? Well, nine if you count the prison sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he's married, he's one of the family values kind of guys. Well, two women have now come forward who say he would take them out on his yacht, put on his pajama bottoms and turn on a lava lamp and give them champagne. Wasn't that the plot of the movie 'Pootie Tang?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a recent speech, former diplomat Joe Wilson -- do you know who he is? He's the husband of the outed CIA agent Valerie Plame? You know the whole story? Anyway. He called columnist Bob Novak a jerk and an a-hole. Well, you see how he became a diplomat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the US Postal Service said today they expect to handle 20 billion -- 20 billion pieces of mail this holiday season. They'll only deliver 10 billion, but they'll handle -- you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night down in Washington, DC, President Bush lighted the national Christmas tree. A 40-foot spruce, and it was chopped down and shipped to the White House by Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush threw the electrical switch and the tree came to life, and it worked so well, they're thinking of trying it with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beautiful tree, it was a big majestic Norwegian spruce, and they cut it down, and President Bush said it proves we're winning the war on evergreens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and the First Lady sent Christmas cards to the leaders of 200 countries. Isn't that nice? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it would have been 201 but someone told the President, 'Legoland is not a real country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bulgaria and Ukraine announced that they're considering pulling their forces out of Iraq. Yeah, apparently the troops will be withdrawn as soon as they can find a car that seats six people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fidel Castro announced today that the Cuban national team will play in next year's world baseball classic in Puerto Rico. They're going to let them go. In fact, the Cuban team left on a raft this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the USC-UCLA college football game over the weekend, &quot;UCLA gave up so quickly that after the game, they got a congratulatory phone call from the president of France.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Texas, President Bush has been called for jury duty. And he says he's going to serve. Oh, man. Hey, we want him to get out of Iraq. He can't even get out of jury duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is pretty excited about being called until he found out it wasn't the Saddam Hussein trial. Aw!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that President Bush has not actually received a jury summons yet. They think it might have gotten mixed in with some CIA daily briefings and accidentally tossed it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush came out again today for expanding his guest worker program. You know about this? This is a program where immigrants will take the low paying jobs that no one in America wants, like Dodger manager.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man from Arkansas scaled the fence at the White House and was immediately captured by Secret Service. He was handcuffed and led away, which is a pretty common sight at the White House these days. So nobody made a big deal about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security and the State Department are now looking for a cheap, convenient way for the United States and Canadian citizens to provide and prove their identity. You know, when crossing the border. Simple enough way to do it. When you see people crossing the border from the United States into Canada and they have cheap prescription drugs...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Randy 'Duke' Cunningham, he's the congressman that was admitted taking $2.4 million in bribes -- this is not an apple here. -- has resigned from office, is going to prison, yet he will receive for the rest of his life a congressional pension. Isn't that amazing? He doesn't have to work and he gets the money anyway. It's like he's still in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Pakistan has announced they've killed a top al Qaeda leader. On the news, this is what it said on the news. This leader ranks somewhere between the number three and number five man. I'm going out on a limb here. I'm guessing he's the number four?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today they sent out 1.4 million Christmas cards this year. 1.4 million. You know, when Clinton was president he sent out twice the number of cards. Of course, that was for Valentine's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know whose birthday it is today? General George Custer. This is his birthday today. Like President Bush, he had no exit strategy either.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of the 9/11 Commission says the Bush Administration's report card on how well they responded to the Commission's recommendation has way too many 'Ds' and 'Fs.' A lot of 'Ds' and 'Fs.' Or as President Bush called it -- high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say, 'We are not prepared for terrorism.' Terrorism? We're not even prepared for hurricanes. And we knew they were coming a week ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I listened to President Bush's radio address on Saturday. And he said, 'Border guards' ? listen to this. 'Have caught and sent home 4.5 million illegal immigrants.' Actually, it's just the same guy they caught 4 1/2 million times. He's very determined, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Bush supporters are very upset about the TV show, 'The West Wing.' You watch 'The West Wing?' They say there are too many Democrats on 'The West Wing.' That will balance out. When 'Prison Break' comes back, there will be a lot more Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek magazine, a big frightening story about women and terror. Did you read this? They say al Qaeda now recruiting women to be suicide bombers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the Cirque de Saddam trial yesterday in Baghdad, Saddam Hussein told the judge, 'Go to hell!' That's what he said, 'Go to hell!' The judge said, 'Hey, we're in Iraq. We're already in hell, pal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam did not show up for his trial today. He's boycotting his trial. How does that work? How can a defendant not show up? I mean, Bush can't even get out of jury duty, and he doesn't have to show up for his trial?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, the White House held the annual Hanukkah ceremony. Even though it's three weeks early, he wanted to light the Menorah. Now, for those of you who aren't Jewish, Hanukkah celebrates the miracle of when only a tiny amount of oil burned for eight days. Boy, that sounds like a Republican's worst nightmare, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush really understood the meaning of Hanukkah. After the candles were lit, he sang happy birthday and blew them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of all of the recent scandals, Tom DeLay, not very popular in his home district of Texas there.

No, see, that's the problem with the Democrats, they do great against the Republicans until they name a candidate. Then they get screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at an event in Washington, First Lady Laura Bush read 'The Grinch who Stole Christmas' to a group of children. Isn't that nice? Yeah, unfortunately the First Lady was interrupted when Vice President Dick Cheney yelled, 'Go, Grinch!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats are very upset with Hillary Clinton because her position on the Iraq war is not clear. You can tell she's running for president.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of conservatives are upset that the White House Christmas card doesn't say 'Christmas' on it. Have you heard this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, Dick Cheney replaced his pacemaker with a George Foreman grill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they held the elections in Iraq. The results are slowly coming in. The only thing we know for sure at this point: Al Gore lost again.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said we might not know the results of the Iraqi election till January. We might have to wait a month. Hey, that's still quick by Florida standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have a ban on cars in Iraq on voting day, so the people have to walk to the polls. Eighty percent showed up to vote. If we had to walk to the polls, we'd have like three people voting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqis had to choose from 7,655 candidates. Imagine those people in Palm Beach with a ballot with 8,000 names. Their heads would explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was a little cocky about the voter turnout. All day long, he went around giving his critics the purple finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, President Bush said, 'I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq.' I don't think you got to worry about a lot of people trying to take credit for that one. ... Like the captain of Titanic going, 'You know, it was my idea to hit the iceberg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you have to give President Bush credit. He said the responsibility for invading Iraq was completely his fault, and he takes full responsibility for it. To which the Democrats said, 'How sneaky is that? See, Bush is now trying to play the truth card.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The general elections taking place today in Iraq, so I guess that means we are one step closer to being there for another 10 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been reports of 1,000 fake ballots in the Iraqi elections. Sounds like another victory for the Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush &quot;said most of the intelligence reports he got about Iraq were wrong. Well, thankfully, no harm done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only time more people voted in the Middle East was during 'Fallujah's Funniest Home Videos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will take up to two weeks to figure out who won today's Iraqi elections. So far it looks like the winner will be the dark-haired guy with the mustache.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to say this, but it looks like Election Day is the only day things don't blow up in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cold weather continues to spread across the United States. In fact, down south it was so cold, people were shaking like Jerry Falwell trying to watch 'Brokeback Mountain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Iran started lighting Hanukkah candles just for warmth. That's how cold it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week the big story, President Bush admitted the United States went to war in Iraq based on bad intelligence. But then the President says, knowing what we know now, he says he would still do it again. So at least we're learning from our mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the reaction president Bush got from accepting all the blame leading up to the Iraqi war has been so good for him, his approval rating is up. He's now thinking of accepting blame for the cold weather, Hurricane Katrina and NBC's fall lineup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see, it look likes the Iraqi elections were a success. Huge voter turnout. 70% of the people voted. Isn't that amazing? Imagine how many people will be voting once they get 'Iraqi idol' over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know when you vote over there, they paint your finger purple. In fact, I saw a guy today with a purple finger. Bad news, it was my proctologist. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi officials have announced they captured that al Zarqawi guy, and then accidentally let him go. They let a crazed killer go free. Thank God that could never happen in America, huh? Okay, other than OJ and Robert Blake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a bizarre story. A congressional press secretary by the name of Thomas Springer was arrested for bank robbery. The guy's a congressional press secretary. Officials say he committed at least seven bank robberies. Hear his excuse? He said he fell in with the wrong crowd. Yeah, Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an English guy in the news today -- 49 years old, has survived 32 cardiac arrests. Do you know what you call someone in America who has had 32 heart attacks? The Vice President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is almost shocking. A survey by the National Assessment of Adult Literacy found 1 in 20 adults in this country have such poor English skills they can't even read the directions on a bottle of medicine. One guy they interviewed in Washington, DC couldn't even read the daily briefings he got every day from the CIA on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you experienced mail slowdowns because of the holidays? It's all volume related. As a matter of fact, earlier today I finally got my White House Christmas card. And it was beautiful. Nice shot of the White House lawn with the Nixons out front waving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House, President Bush was very excited to show reporters his iPod. Did you hear about that? He showed them his iPod. Reporters said they didn't have the heart to tell the President that his iPod is really just a garage door opener.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to CNN, top Democrats have mixed feelings about Senator Hillary Clinton running for president. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, some Democrats don't like the idea, while the others hate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm coming to work this morning, and they're playing Christmas music on the radio. And they're playing that song, you know ? 'He knows when you've been sleeping, he knows when you're awake, he knows if you've been bad or good.' So apparently Santa works for the National Security Agency. I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning announcement, Federal officials now admit that after 9/11, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on people in the United States without a warrant. Yeah, yeah. In fact, listen to this. They knew days before it happened that Nick and Jessica were splitting up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you find yourself on your cell phone going, 'Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?' Don't be surprised if someone from the CIA goes, 'Yes, we can hear you clearly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is trying to put the best spin they can on this eavesdropping scandal. Like, he said today this proves we have a government that listens to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his 318th Iraqi speech, President Bush said on Sunday that the terrorists view the world as a giant battlefield. As opposed to us, who view the world as a giant oil field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said he's worried that the United States has an image problem in the Middle East. Is that what it is, an image problem? No, no, New Jersey has an image problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bulgaria just announced they're pulling all their troops from Iraq. Both of them. ... They're both leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they said they'll replace their troops with a noncombat unit, which I believe would be the French army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see who visited President Bush in the White House last week? Hillary Clinton. Hillary -- actually, she was just there measuring for drapes. But yes, she was visiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said on a news show the other day, he wouldn't mind being the spouse of the president. Well, sure, he'd be back in the White House, no duties, free times on his hands. What could possibly go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise trip to Iraq yesterday, he was there and gave the troops one of his warm holiday sneers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you think about it, when you're at war in some far off corner of the world, what better than a visit from a guy who got five draft deferments.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi officials met with Dick Cheney, or as they like to call him in the Mideast, Lawrence of Arrhythmia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Time magazine named former President Bill Clinton and former President George W. Bush Senior as 'partners of the year,' partners of the year. It's amazing. These guys, Clinton and Bush are so close that they're talking about making a cowboy movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, here's a holiday announcement, the Post Office has today handled more than 500 million pieces of mail. Today handled more than 500 million pieces of mail. They didn't deliver them, they just handled them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a disaster in New York. Did you see that? Buses and trains were shut down Tuesday in a city-wide strike by transit workers. This is the most horrible thing to happen in New York since Regis released that Christmas album.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have got some great gadgets this year for Christmas. ... This cell phone that has caller ID, call waiting, text messaging and a flashing button to let you know when President Bush is eavesdropping on your calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story, you know. President Bush and this whole domestic spying thing. Remember the good old days when the only thing you had to worry about on your phone were telemarketers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise visit to Iraq over the weekend. He met with the Iraqi prime minister who showed him his purple finger from the election. Then Cheney showed the Iraqi minister his purple fingers from bad circulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran has officially banned all Western music in that country. So apparently they must have heard Kevin Federline's new CD, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;USC Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush announced he is available for the NFL draft. Actually, this also marks the first time in history the words 'Bush' and 'available for the draft' have ever appeared together in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton taped a message and sent it to Elton John's bachelor party. They played it. In the video, Clinton claims he supports same-sex marriage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police are actually stopping cars to make sure they have four people. Yeah. As a result, Donald Trump had to come to work today with three chauffeurs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is day two of this transit strike. It's really crippling the city. I mean, nobody can get in. Even King Kong's stuck in Hoboken this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's happening going on with George W. Bush. Anybody know what the 'W' stands for? Anybody know? Wiretap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek magazine reporting that President Bush called the editor and the publisher of the New York Times two weeks ago and demanded they stop publishing this article about him illegally eavesdropping and wire tapping people. Here's my question -- how did he know they were going to publish it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney cut short his visit to the Middle East to rush back to the Senate to vote on legislation to open the Alaskan wildlife preserve to oil drilling. Isn't that amazing? It takes a week for these guys to get off their ass during a hurricane, but when it involves oil, 'When is the next flight? We'll be down there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC has a new game show called 'Deal or No Deal.' This is Howie Mandel. Have you seen it? You know, it's pretty good. I'm watching it last night. And I see all these suitcases filled with cash. I just thought it was a 'Dateline' special on Tom DeLay. But no, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we're making jokes about it, or trying to, but traffic is actually horrible here in New York City. The city is like Dick Cheney. Every major artery is clogged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he is not eavesdropping on citizens. He is just monitoring calls for quality control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some New Yorkers say that trying to find people to share cabs with is creating an excellent way to meet other New Yorkers. That's true. That's what they're saying, yeah. In fact, this morning, I met a guy who screamed, 'Hey, a-hole, that's my cab.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the strike -- this is true -- yesterday, there were 15,000 bus stop shelters that were going completely unused. Yeah. Today, the city started calling the shelters 'studio apartments' and renting them for $4,000 a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Saddam Hussein claimed that he and his co-defendants were beaten and tortured while in US custody. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, his exact quote was, 'They Saddamed us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney warned members of Congress that parts of the Patriot Act are set to expire in ten days. Yeah. Not only that, parts of Dick Cheney are set to expire in ten days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, three wise men arrived at the White House. They were lawyers trying to help President Bush avoid impeachment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more members of Congress are saying that President Bush broke the law when he ordered those wiretaps without warrants. Some are calling what Bush did an impeachable offense. So he could be impeached for eavesdropping, as opposed to Clinton who was impeached for pants dropping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Counterterrorism experts say the latest weapon used by terrorists is cumin. It's the spice. Have you heard of this? Okay, I didn't know what this was. Cumin is a spice. They're using it to make explosives more powerful. So, apparently, these terrorist are watching Martha Stewart now, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Michael Bloomberg estimated that during the strike, the city lost $700 million. Fortunately, Bloomberg was able to make up for it when he found $700 million in an old pair of his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All kinds of gigantic after-Christmas sales going on. See some of them? Today in Washington, lobbyist Jack Abramoff selling Tom DeLay, 50% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that he wants Syria and Iran to keep al Qaeda members from entering Iraq. Al Qaeda members? We can't even keep Florida high school teens from entering Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A high school kid from Florida -- I guess the kid, his parents are from Iraq. He's American born, but he's from Iraqi descent.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, according to a new poll, President Bush's approval rating on the rise. A lot of those polls are phone polls. People are worried Bush is listening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to USA Today, John Kerry is positioning himself for another run at the White House in 2008. Kerry said this campaign will be much better than the last one. This time, he's going to take at least three positions on each issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's the start of a new year, and President Bush wants to hit the ground bungling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A kid from Florida is like 16 years old. He runs away from home and goes to Iraq. He wanted to see what it was like. His family was from Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the White House, while President Bush was spending the holidays at his Texas ranch, he was clearing brush and a tree branch cut his face. Yeah. As a result, the tree was cut down and tortured by Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff has agreed to cooperate with Federal prosecutors. He could name up to 20 congressmen. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'That's amazing. I can only name three congressmen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you. You know what I was thinking? The time it took me to walk out here, five more congressmen got caught taking bribes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big scandal in Washington -- this lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who had close ties to a lot of Republicans. Did you hear about this guy? He pled guilty to corruption and fraud charges. When they booked him, they had to empty his pockets, Tom DeLay fell out. That's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To get a better deal now, he's going to testify against some of the other weasels in Congress. They have a lobbyist testifying against congressmen. How many Bibles will burst into flames in that courtroom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this will be the deepest televised probe since Katie Couric's colonoscopy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're learning more and more about this Abramoff guy. Did you know before he became a Washington lobbyist, he was a Hollywood movie producer. So he kind of went from Sodom to Gomorrah. Kind of a lateral move there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's also a very religious guy. Did you know he's an Orthodox Jew? Orthodox, or as they're calling him in prison, the guy who ordered the kosher meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced that he was wounded over the weekend by a tree. Did you hear about this? President Bush was clearing brush at his ranch, got scratched by a tree. That's a switch, huh? A tree harming a Republican. When has that ever happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Bush has cut down so many trees, they're starting to fight back now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the beginning of the year, we've got some great news. Crime in New York City is at an all-time low. How about that, ladies and gentlemen! And I was thinking about this and I said to myself, it must be true because it's been weeks since I have had to look through a two-way mirror and say, 'That's him, officer, that's him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my God! Donald Trump, they're talking about, running for president. Did you hear this? Donald Trump running for president. I blame George Bush. He lowered the standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump as president of the United States. I can't wait for the Washington Monument to go condo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this, the sleazy Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff has been indicted, did you hear about this? Yeah, many, many charges, one of which was providing entertainment. By God, they'll never get me on that. My hands are clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a fascinating story last week, a kid like a 16-year-old kid from Florida, his parents, ancestors were from Iraq. He wanted to see what is going on in Iraq, so he goes, hangs around in Iraq to see what is going on. It's just crazy, isn't it? And he gets home, his mother obviously is worried and up set and happy he's home. And says, 'Why in God's name did you go to Iraq?' The kid said, 'Well, I got bad intelligence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the American Bar Association gave Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito their highest rating. Isn't that good? He got the highest rating, yeah. Yeah, President Bush gave Alito his highest rating, too, because he called him 'super' and 'duper.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election in Iraq was three weeks ago. Believe it or not, officials are saying it's going to be another two weeks before they announce who won. Yeah, the odd part is, the winner will be announced by Ryan Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Rose Bowl, did &quot;you all see Sandra Day O'Connor making the coin toss? You see that? When President Bush saw a Supreme Court justice flipping a coin, he went, 'That's how I got elected! Hey!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, what was Reggie Bush thinking, trying to lateral the ball in the red zone? You see that? What was that that? A guy named Bush making a bonehead move -- what are the odds of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why I think Texas won? I think President Bush was eavesdropping on the USC huddle and then passing it on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new world record set yesterday in the 100-meter dash. It was set by a congressman trying to run away from that Jack Abramoff guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The super-lobbyist guy, this Jack Abramoff, pleaded guilty this week, to corruption and fraud charges. Now in order to cut a deal, he's going to testify against some congressmen, huh? A lobbyist turning on a group of congressmen. When will this white-on-white crime stop?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today, as everybody else did, that President Bush's re-election campaign is going it take the money that they got from this Jack Abramoff guy, and donate it to heart patients in need. See, it goes right back to Cheney again. This is unbelievable. It's a vicious cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Jack Abramoff, he lobbied for Indian gaming. He got a lot of money from the Indian gaming people. And then he defrauded them. He defrauded the Indian tribes, and took their money. You know, I just hope this one incident doesn't poison the normally good trust that has existed between the white man and the Indian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Tom DeLay, also from Texas -- don't hear a lot of applause on that one -- he has also been indicted. Officially filed for re-election. He's been indicted and he filed for re-election. Great campaign slogan, 'Give me two more years, before the judge gives me five to ten.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this past weekend, former Washington, DC, Mayor Marion Barry -- remember him, Marion Barry? He was robbed at gunpoint at his home, and the assailants took his money and used it to buy crack. Which is ironic, because that's the same thing Marion was going to do with the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 40-year-old woman in Israel, whose friends call her an eccentric millionaire -- did you hear? This is a true story. ... Had a wedding ceremony, married a dolphin. And President Bush said he has no problem with that, as long as the dolphin's not gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you're here on a good night, ladies and gentlemen. The entire balcony of the Ed Sullivan Theater is full of indicted Washington lobbyists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the Jack Abramoff scandal, that in Washington, DC, congressmen are actually now returning illegal gifts. I called the weather bureau, and sure enough, hell has frozen over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who was the former chef at the White House has written a tell-all book. Yes. A tell-all book. For example, he says Dick Cheney, Dick Cheney, Vice President, his favorite recipe is something called 'Chicken Gitmo.' It's chicken bound and gagged on a bed of rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush fired the guy, the former chef, for serving scallops. I'm thinking, well, gosh, is this the guy he should be firing? What about those guys who got us into Iraq? Why didn't he fire those guys?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a story now that Donald Trump will be running for president. How about that? Donald Trump as president. There would be a lot of changes. I want to tell you, if Donald Trump was president, a lot of changes. Instead of the CIA, Trump would be getting bad intelligence from his barber.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pat Robertson said that Ariel Sharon's massive stroke was God's punishment for him giving up Israeli territory. If you're playing along at home, this is Pat's first idiotic statement of the new year.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Pat Robertson ever gets tired of being a televangelist, he would make a great administrator for an HMO. 'Broken leg? Yeah, God's mad at you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lots and lots of people returning gifts this week. And that's just congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Bush returned the $6,000 given to him by that creepy lobbyist guy Jack Abramoff. But Bush said he hadn't done anything with the money. In fact, it still had the original strings attached.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what the difference is between a bribe and a gift? Neither does Congress, that's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Senate aide, who asked to remain anonymous, said the Republicans will put forth a sweeping package of ethics reform. Washington's probably the only place in the world where people who talk about ethics want to remain anonymous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are so bad now, the Iraqis are offering to help us try and restore democracy in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;France and Germany warned Iran this week not to pursue their nuclear research program. In fact, France and Germany warned Iran if they didn't stop their program, they would, you know, warn them again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with all the former secretaries of state and defense for advice on Iraq. This is quite a change. This is the first time Bush has ever listened to anybody. Well, if you don't count the wiretaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans now want Donald Trump to run for governor of New York. I think it would be nice to see the guy get a little publicity for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story is indicted Congressman Tom DeLay announced he is resigning as House Majority Leader. But he says he's still going to run for reelection. Apparently, he's too corrupt to be a leader, but not too corrupt to be just a congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is Vice President Dick Cheney feeling much better after being released from the hospital for minor breathing problems. Have you seen him now? He's now walking with a cane. Apparently, he was constantly having to kick President Bush under the table every time he made a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the scandals, Republicans in Congress are now putting together what they call a sweeping lobbying reform package. They say it's such a popular idea they're going to charge major corporations $1 million to sponsor it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Jack Abramoff guy allegedly bribed lawmakers on issues ranging from wireless phone service to Internet gambling. This guy was really up-to-date on technology. In fact, before he was indicted, he was working a deal -- listen to this. He had a deal going with them home shopping network where it would allow you to buy a congressman online.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And do you know that Jack Abramoff and Monica Lewinski went to Beverly Hills High School? What are the odds of that? I mean, they both wanted access to the president. The difference, of course -- Jack just wanted the president's ear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors say Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has regained some brain function. The bad news -- Pat Robertson, still no brain function at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Pat Robertson said that Ariel Sharon had a stroke because God was punishing him for dividing Israel. Now, remember a couple of years ago when Pat Robertson announced he had prostate cancer? Do you think maybe God was punishing him for being a pain in the ass?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, our own Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, had a little motorcycle accident. Luckily, he's fine. Wound up with 15 stitches in his lips. You thought he was hard to understand before. Well, Pat Robertson said the accident was God punishing Arnold for making 'Kindergarten Cop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge ruled last week that mooning is now illegal in Maryland. That's not really the problem. A lot of people who live in Maryland work in Washington. And as you know, they're more concerned with covering their ass than showing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush has just signed into law a bill allowing slot machines in the state of Florida. They never had them. They're doing this because old people love to play slot machines. You ever see these people? They love to play them. Here's my question. How come these old people can play five, six, seven slot machines at a time, but they can't work a voting machine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;City officials announced last week a record 24.9 million people visited Los Angeles last year. Isn't that amazing? Half flew into LAX. The other half snuck across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy has a new children's book out. It's called, 'Daddy, Why Is My Head So Big?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down there in Washington earlier today, Dick Cheney had another scare. They hospitalized him because of shortness of breath. He's okay. And he was just winded from torturing a detainee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then later today the Justice Department was evacuated because of a suspicious package. Well that turned out to be just a bag of cash dropped off by Jack Abramoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is encouraging news out of Israel, Ariel Sharon is emerging from a coma. However doctors say he may have impaired mental function. Impaired mental function. And I thought, 'Well hell, that doesn't stop Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had a little scare, was rushed to the hospital because of difficulty breathing. Fortunately, the breathing difficulty had nothing to do with his heart. It was just due to the Administration's environmental policy. The EAP cut back, that's all it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed Dick Cheney's been walking with a cane lately? Have you seen that? He said, he doesn't really need the cane, he just likes the idea that a tree had to be cut down to make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors say Ariel Sharon is responding to treatment. He can now move his hand. And the first thing he did when he moved his hand was give Pat Robertson the finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our own Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger involved in a minor motorcycle accident on Sunday. Had to get 15 stitches in his lip. Did you see? See how puffed up? I thought he was dating Bobby Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He plans to go back in time and destroy the other driver before the accident ever happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who witnessed the accident immediately rushed over to Arnold and they said he was conscious, but they couldn't understand what he was saying. So, that's when they knew he was all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court confirmation hearings are under way for Judge Samuel Alito. It's pretty interesting. Democrats want to know his position on privacy. Republicans want to know his position on prison terms for bribery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of Democrats are worried that Judge Alito may be a threat to the endangered species list. Democrats have been worried about the endangered species list since they found out they were on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an ex-Wal-Mart top executive has pled guilty to fraud. Apparently, some of the employees are not real illegal aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks been watching the Judge Alito confirmation hearings on TV? I'm very excited about it because for one week I'm not the dullest man on television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During Judge Alito's hearing, Senator Ted Kennedy accidentally referred to Alito as 'Ali-oto.' Yeah. Afterwards, Kennedy said, 'You'll have to forgive me, I'm sober.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush was asked about Judge Alito. The President said, this is a quote, 'He is eminently qualified.' Yeah. Then the President said, 'Unless the word &quot;eminently&quot; means &quot;not.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney was rushed to the hospital after complaining of shortness of breath. Yeah. Yeah, you could tell that Cheney's used to these trips because he told the ambulance driver, 'I know a shortcut.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a motorcycle accident and needed 15 stitches on his lip. Yeah. Yeah, you can tell the accident really messed Arnold's lip, 'cause now you can understand every word he's saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Schwarzenegger, back at work after he had that motorcycle accident. He had to have 15 stitches to his left upper lip. The whole left side of his face was numb, which is tough for a politician. Imagine only being able to speak out of one side of your mouth at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hamas terror organization has announced it now has its own TV station. Great! Now NBC will be the fifth-rated network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bed makers announced today, they've come out with something new -- the 'extreme ultra king-size bed.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Ted Kennedy has a dog named Splash, and they're writing this children's book. Now, that's the best name for Ted Kennedy's dog? Even the dog is going, 'No, no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please. Isn't that like that Jack Abramoff guy naming his dog 'Bribe?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's reports that that Abramoff guy -- you know the lobbyist involved in the corruption scandal? It was on the cover of Time, but now saying he's broke.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week in 1861 -- yesterday, actually, Florida seceded from the Union. Actually, it seceded in 1859, but it wasn't until 1861&quot; when &quot;all of the votes were finally tabulated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been watching the Alito Supreme Court nomination hearings? And it's exciting. And the Democrats are already set.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hearings are so dull that that woman in Cincinnati who was dead in front of her TV for two years, she got up and turned them off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new survey by the AMA, and according to the survey, 15% of all Americans in the American workforce are on the job drunk. ... 15% of Americans drunk on the job. Hmmm, I wonder if that's how we got into Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that President Bush calls Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito 'Sam.' That's what he calls him, yeah. Yeah, Alito says he's happy with his nickname, especially since the President calls Ruth Bader Ginsburg 'Gins-dog.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reports that former DC Mayor Marion Barry has once again tested positive for cocaine. Yeah, apparently, police suspected Marion Barry was using cocaine when they noticed that he was Marion Barry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors in Israel are now slowly withdrawing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon out of his coma to see what his remaining brain function is. Political experts say it's unlikely anyone could run a country with a severe loss of brain activity. I beg to differ!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pat Robertson has apologized to Sharon's son for the comments that he made about Ariel Sharon. I don't think he gets it. George, do you have the card? This is the actual card Pat Robertson sent to Ariel Sharon. He said, 'Sorry you're sick. God must hate you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you watched any of the confirmation hearings with Sam Alito? Fascinating to watch. I'm watching it. Senators are given 30 minutes to question the guy. They get 30 minutes. Senator Joe Biden's question took 23 1/2 minutes. And Alito is smart. Do you know what he said when Biden finished? He said, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy got pretty contentious after he pointed out that Alito once belonged to a club that didn't allow women. It was discovered Senator Kennedy also once belonged to a club that wouldn't allow women. Because with Kennedys, the rules are in place purely for the safety of the women. It's a different situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting. They asked the judge a lot of questions, to see if he's in touch with the average American. What is the price of a loaf of bread? How much is a gallon of milk? What is the cost to buy a congressman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the Abramoff guy. You know, the lobbyist involved in the corruption scandal? They're now saying he's completely out of money. Tapped out. In fact, they're making a movie about him called 'Broke Ass Mountain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest bird flu update. They actually said today on MSNBC, they said, 'Do not play with dead poultry.' Well, there goes my weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what they said, do not play with dead poultry. So if you have kids, hey, this weekend, just make sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new report says for the first time in 20 years, there's been a huge increase in the number of Mexican women sneaking over the border. Well, of course. This is where all the Mexican men are. What do you expect them to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy is publishing a book about Washington, DC, from the viewpoint of his dog. His dog's name is Splash. Which seems odd. I mentioned this last night. I'm not making it up. Ted Kennedy's dog's name is splash. It's like OJ naming his dog 'Slash,' isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy said he got the idea for a book about a dog's eye view about Washington late one night when he was crawling home on all fours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight's show turns out better than last night's show. Oh my God, halfway through last night's show, Judge Alito's wife ran out in tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching the Judge Alito confirmation hearings? They're so dull, they're so dull that CBS has ordered 13 more episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Alito guy, he's not very forthcoming and he is very tight-lipped. And finally, to loosen him up, Ted Kennedy sent over a couple of Bloody Marys.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Los Angeles police have decided not to press charges against California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, even though Arnold was involved in an accident with improper vehicle registration. Yeah, officials said it's punishment enough to hear Arnold say 'improper vehicle registration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During an odd moment at the [Alito] hearings yesterday, this is true -- Senator Arlen Specter announced out of nowhere that he goes to the same gym as Senator Ted Kennedy. Yeah, not surprisingly, it's the gym that's closed 364 days a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

And reports from the day they put together historical documents indicating that he was really depressed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Al Gore attacked the Bush Administration's use of wiretapping and torture to combat terrorism. Gore said Bush has created a police state. And here's the ironic part. Even in a police state, Al Gore could not get arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British scientists are now seeking permission to create a rabbit-human hybrid embryo for stem-cell research purposes. This is unbelievable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert Brooks' new movie is &quot;called 'Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World.' Don't confuse that with President Bush's movie, 'Looking for Oil in the Muslim World.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new tape from Osama bin Laden, did you hear about this? Kind of chilling, ugly thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People at the State Department think that Osama may be losing it. They think he may be getting wacky. Because in the tape he offers to sell his kidney stone for $25,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A tape was broadcast on al Jazeera that is reportedly the first message from Osama bin Laden in over a year. Yeah, experts think it may not be a new tape, because in the background you can hear, 'Who Let the Dogs Out?'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's the first tape he's released since December of 2004. This guy takes longer to put out his stuff than 'The Sopranos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the odd thing. Have you heard the tape? It's really weird. He has three duets with his new wife, June bin laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this new tape, it's interesting, bin Laden says he's willing to make a truce with the United States, but only through the new season of 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you notice bin Laden's now trying to soften his image. You see his latest picture? Show his latest picture. Look, he's got the Hello Kitty headband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in our most recent US air strike over there in Pakistan, we blew up Osama bin Laden's top bomb maker. Yeah, blew him up. And I guess Osama bin Laden's already written a book about it. It just came out today. It's called, 'A Million Little Pieces of Shiite.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States Supreme Court has upheld Oregon's law that helps doctors with assisted suicide. Now, don't think this is a California law that lets Robert Blake help with assisted suicide. That's totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is scary. The Bush Administration, asking Google -- you know the search engine Google? -- to turn over all its records in a porn investigation. They want to know who's been using Google to look up pornography. You know what that means? We're all going to jail!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today it is unacceptable for Iraqi security forces to be engaged in torture. This is my question. Why do we always refer to it as 'engaged in torture?' See, I guess guys normally associate torture with engagement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said in a speech this week that President Bush is one of the worst in history. President Bush is furious. Oh, man. You see what he said? He said, 'I was not the worst in history. I was the worst in math and science.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'National Enquirer' -- you know them. They check, recheck and check the facts again. They're reporting this week that Senator Ted Kennedy has a 21-year-old secret love child. Is that the most accurate description, 'love child?' Isn't it 'drunken fling child?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Senator Kennedy was not available for comment on the love child. He was overseeing a hearing on ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced this week that they are issuing new $50 border travel cards to make it easier to cross the border of Mexico. Could we make it any easier? Why don't we put a moving sidewalk in? How about mileage reward points? Free tote bags?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was gone -- maybe you didn't even know it was gone, but now it's back. I'm talking about the Miss America pageant, back. That's right. Tomorrow night -- and everybody has Miss America fever. As a matter of fact, earlier today, President Bush pledged to rebuild Miss Louisiana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush met with the Belgian prime minister, and things grew tense when the prime minister called for the US to leave Guantanamo Bay.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his latest audiotaped message, Osama bin Laden recommends a book that all Americans should read. Yeah. You can tell bin Laden is hungry for power, 'cause now he thinks he's Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's still analyzing Osama Bin Laden's latest tape. He called Bush a liar and said that he was just after oil. You know, it's the usual stuff we've heard before, like at the Golden Globes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Ted Kennedy said he plans to quit the Owl Club. It's a social club that bans women. Today, Hillary Clinton asked him if he knew of any other clubs that banned women that her husband could join.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Bush Administration is conducting a war on pornography. Well, it's about time. You thought we had no allies in Iraq. Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, what they're doing, they're asking the search engine Google to hand over a million porn sites that people have been -- they want to see who's going on the porn sites. But Google is refusing. See, I don't think Google should hand it over. You know something? Look, if the government wants to collect a million porn sites, what they should do, they should have to spend hours a day painstakingly searching the web like the rest of us have to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I remember the good old days. I'm old enough. Remember during Clinton when the White House was a porn site? What happened to that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh -- there's a report in the paper today that Florida Governor Jeb Bush reads three newspapers a day. Actually, he reads them to his brother George, that's what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC has canceled 'The West Wing.' NBC executives said today they wanted to cancel it now to preserve its dignity. Its dignity. These are the same people that came up with 'Fear Factor,' okay?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'Commander in Chief,' the ratings have been falling for that show, too. You know the show about the first female president? Its numbers are going down. And you think the star Geena Davis is worried, you should see Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see Hillary on 'Oprah' yesterday? Hillary was on 'Oprah.' Yeah, yeah. No jumping up and down on the couch about that marriage, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton was talking about President Bush's domestic spying program today, and she called President Bush's eavesdropping explanation strange and far-fetched. Now, let me tell you something. If anyone has heard of strange and far-fetched -- explanations from a President of the United States, it is Hillary, so she knows what she's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Attorney General of the United States made a big announcement this week in their latest victory in the war on terrorism. They announced the indictment of 11 animal rights activists for arson attacks in which no one was killed. Apparently, there were -- their targets were condos in Vail. They we were going to burn down condos in Vail. Well, you can see why they went after them. You want to hit the Republicans where it hurts, you attack their vacation homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush visited the NSA. You know, the super secret NSA headquarters, that's the big spy headquarters. One kind of embarrassing moment. He asked if he could see the cone of silence. ... They had to explain that they didn't really exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is kind of scary. At a press conference yesterday, NASA announced that the year 2005 was the hottest year on record. Yeah. It was so hot that the global warming was so bad that if the presidential elections were held today, Al Gore would still lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Al Gore is writing his second book on global warming. It just came out today. We have a copy, it's called 'The Earth is Warming, My Career is Cooling' by Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in the book, he discusses his personal story about how he became interested in temperature changes. Fascinating. See, when he was Vice President, he was put in charge of the White House thermostat. From constantly changing it every day, he got interested in the temperature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's big news from the world of broadcasting. How many of you folks know the WB? ... And what about the UPN? ... Well, guess what? They're now merging. They're merging into one network and they'll be called WC. That's right. Now President Bush was warned in advance and did nothing to stop this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Bush, he's talking to the National Security Agency to kind of boost morale. These are the people who do all the wiretapping for us. He's talking to them trying to boost their morale. You also can talk to the National Security Agency just by dialing any phone number in the country. Hello.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Kansas a couple of days ago and the kids at the college asked him if he had seen 'Brokeback Mountain.' He hadn't seen that. He said he doesn't like westerns where the cowboys ride into town for a day spa. He said he didn't care for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is an old-fashioned kind of guy. He leaves the room during Ben Gay commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listing things to keep people happy during the most depressing time of the year: &quot;If Hillary becomes president, it's a good bet Bill will do some crazy-ass things in the White House again. That will make you happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities found a drug tunnel from the Tijuana Airport to a building here in California. They said it was wide enough for a car. It had lighting, good ventilation, had a pump to remove water, and the whole thing was built in about six months, and it worked perfectly. How come my hometown of Boston, they spent the last 15 years, $14.5 billion, building this stupid tunnel? Let's get these guys to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Vice President Dick Cheney, or, as they call him in Washington, 'The Fresh Prince of Intensive Care.' He turned 65 years old today. So, for those of you that took the 'over,' you win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that Bill Clinton had become so close to his father, because they tour because of Katrina. He said Clinton is like a brother to him. Which is great, because it gives the first President Bush that smart son he never had.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight President Bush gave his state of the union address, or as they call it on ABC, 'dancing with the issues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's funny when you watch the state of the union, I love the reaction from the different parties. Like, Republicans applaud like they're on family feud. 'Good answer, good answer!' Democrats applaud like they're trying to sneak past a motion detector. Not quite making contact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, did you notice, a lot of Republican congressmen were not applauding President Bush. It's hard when you're wearing handcuffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to say I was a little disappointed by the speech. Not once did he apologize to Oprah for lying about weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in the speech tonight, President Bush talked about the need to work hard on the economy, to work hard on health care, and to fight nonstop against terrorism. Then he left to go on a long weekend at his ranch to watch the Super Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one of the big topics tonight of the speech was -- was all the new jobs that have been created. A lot of new jobs have been created. I mean, they're all in India, but still -- they're new jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush...was quite optimistic. He explained that this is a wonderful, prosperous time for the United States, that things are going very well for Americans -- with the possible exception of those few people who don't own an oil company, but it's going very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is now urging all nations to cut off aid to Hamas and Palestine, including the $234 million we were gonna send them. In fact, to make sure the money never gets there, he's putting FEMA in charge just to make sure that that money never gets there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And al Qaeda's number two man, Ayman al Zawahiri. ... Well, he released a new video this week where he called President Bush a war monger, a failure, and a man who has brought catastrophe to the United -- oh, I'm sorry, that was Howard Dean. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, in Palestine the terror group Hamas won by a landslide -- huge, huge margin. How does this make Democrats feel? I mean, they can't win anything, and terrorists are winning by a landslide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Judge Samuel Alito was confirmed to the Supreme Court today. President Bush said that Sam's got the intellect necessary to bring a lot of class to the court. That's what he said. Yeah, like the rest of the judges are sitting around in their underpants eating cheetos, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard -- Al Gore writing a second book on global warming. It just came out today. It's probably called 'you're probably not gonna buy this one either.' Yeah, it's the new Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is an interesting story. Because of their work together on Hurricane Katrina, George Bush says that Bill Clinton has become so close to his father --- you know, the first President Bush -- that Bill Clinton has become like a member of their family. That's what he said, yeah. Like, do you know Bush calls his father 41 because he was the 41st president. And his dad calls him 43. And, of course, they both call Clinton 69. So, it's an interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you didn't see it, in his State of the Union address, President Bush said the United States must move beyond a petroleum-based economy. And then Dick Cheney clutched his heart and said, 'No!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he vowed to fund research into cutting-edge technology to produce fuel from wood. He wants to make fuel from wood. This is part of the Republicans' 'No Tree Left Behind' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, did you see Dick Cheney sitting behind the President? Is it me? Doesn't Cheney always look like the 'before' guy in the erectile dysfunction ads?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And could Hillary Clinton have looked more bored, or what? Did you see her sitting there? She looked like she was listening to another Clinton alibi. 'Mm-hmm, yeah, okay. Yeah, the car broke down again, okay, great. Yeah, I believe you, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite part is when the politicians all applaud the president. See, this is the only time you hear their hands aren't in someone else's pocket. So you can see them, you know.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the new Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito was confirmed and sworn in by the Senate yesterday. You know, he replaces Sandra Day O'Connor, who you know is leaving to be a regular on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in Cirque de Saddam. Have you been watching that trial?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first confirmed case of bird flu has just been discovered in Iraq -- bird flu in Iraq. You know, this kind of thing could destroy their tourism industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many saw President Bush's State of the Union address last night? It was interrupted 72 times by applause, and 30 times for subpoenas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One stirring moment during President Bush's speech when he got a standing ovation from the cricket lobbyists, that was good, and then the groundhog came out...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, President Bush came out of the White House and saw his shadow -- Cindy Sheehan. Yeah, got a little scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched the President's State of the Union address, the other night. You know, that President Bush promised to cut 140 programs that are performing poorly. Or as NBC calls it, our fall schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said the American people are addicted to oil. To which Dick Cheney said, 'Not that there's anything wrong with that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you believe we're addicted to oil? So, basically, when we invaded Iraq, we didn't mean anything, it was just the oil talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're under the influence of oil. We need a 12-step program to get out of Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as many of you know, President Bush was in the energy business for years. The only person ever to lose money in the oil business. When he talks about alternative fuels, he knows what he's talking about. And today, he listed a number of alternative fuels. He said there was regular, unleaded, premium, premium unleaded, diesel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representatives from the major US oil companies are meeting with Cuban officials to discuss a recently discovered oil reserve off the coast of Cuba. Cuba has oil. It is estimated the oil there could suddenly be Cuba's number two export, right behind Major League Baseball players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba says they have the oil. They lack the experienced personnel to drill for it. Don't we have thousands of Arabs on Guantanamo Bay? They're not doing anything. You see what I'm saying? These problems work themselves out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said this week she doesn't agree with either the people who say we should be in Iraq, or her friends who say we should be out. Thanks for clearing that up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think she's running for president? Hello! Even John Kerry's going, 'Pick a position!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also spoke this week about his guest worker program. Or as we call it, Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in what's being called a huge upset for the West, in the Palestinian elections last week, the terror group Hamas -- Hamas won by a landslide. This is probably the only election in the world where people said, 'If you don't vote, that means the terrorists have lost.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein boycotted his trial in Baghdad today, refused to come to the courthouse. Who cares, as long as he shows up for the execution, that's all I care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Post, one of President Bush's biggest pet peeves is when a cell phone goes off during a meeting. He hates that, yeah. Apparently his second-biggest pet peeve is when his Pez dispenser gets jammed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, earlier this week, in other news, an oil tanker ran aground up in Alaska. Did you see that oil tanker? And you know something? Everybody pitched in. Everybody got involved. The environmentalists were saying, 'Save the sea lions,' and the Coast Guard was saying, 'Save the crew,' and the White House was going, 'Save the oil! For the love of God.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just 24 hours after President Bush promised to reduce America's dependence on oil on Tuesday -- 24 hours later, his energy secretary and national economic adviser said the President did not really mean it. That's what he said. He didn't really mean that. They're blaming it on his new speech writer, 'A Million Little Pieces' author James Frey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the President said we must continue to find new sources of oil. The only place he doesn't want any drilling ? 'Brokeback Mountain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush says that Bill Clinton's become so close to his dad -- you know, the first President Bush -- that Clinton has become like a member of his family. Which is pretty amazing, because even Hillary doesn't consider Bill a member of the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1690 that the first paper money in America was issued, which, of course, then led to the creation of the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was also on this day in 1913 that Congress was granted the right to levy taxes on your income, which, of course, led to the creation of the Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Super Bowl is this Sunday. It's in Detroit this year, yeah. And security measures will include gunboats, armed helicopters and bomb-defusing robots. That's true. So in other words, it's a typical Sunday in Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign is several hundred thousand dollars in debt. Yeah. So in other words, there will be a 'Terminator 4.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico announced plans today to cut pollution by 50% by the year 2020. They're not going to do anything special. They figure, by then, only 50% will be left in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Justice Department official has determined that the president of the United States has the legal authority to have someone killed if they want to. That's what they've determined. It's amazing. You're the President, you can legally order the killing of someone. Well, this has got Bill Clinton thinking twice about supporting Hillary now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton wore a giant three-carat diamond ring that Bill gave her. Did see that? Yeah, you know what that means. Yeah, she caught him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the paper, they described the ring as iceberg-like. That's what they said, 'Iceberg-like.' No, I'm sorry. That was the description of Hillary. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzalez, he testified before the Senate about this domestic spying program. But first, before he testified, there was a big fight about whether or not to place him under oath. And ultimately, they decided he did not need to be placed under oath. Baseball players, yes. They have to be under oath. Attorney general? Nah, go ahead!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government has deported a former Playboy playmate from Argentina for being an illegal alien. Do you believe this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ken Mehlman, you ever heard of this guy? He was head of the Republican National Party. He said over the weekend -- you can see the campaign is starting.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a kind of big deal down in Washington last night at the White House. There was a tribute to the Dance Theater of Harlem down there in Washington at the White House, and after the dinner, the President and his wife got up and danced for the crowd.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton today blasted, blasted President Bush in a speech for not catching Osama bin Laden. Is she in a position to criticize, not catching bin Laden? She couldn't even catch Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's latest budget proposal slashes funding for public television by $157 million over the next couple of years. A lot of changes on Sesame Street. The Cookie Monster will be known as the 'Government Cheese Monster.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The weather back East has just been atrocious. Unbelievable. There was so much snow in Washington, DC, Dick Cheney actually shot a fat guy figuring it was a polar bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend on a quail hunting trip in Texas, vice president of the United States Dick Cheney accidentally shot a fellow hunter. A 78-year-old lawyer. In fact, when people found out he shot a lawyer, his popularity now 92%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the guy is gonna be okay. But when the ambulance got there, out of force of habit they put Cheney on the stretcher. 'No, no, the other guy, the other guy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know something, I think Cheney's starting to lose it. You know, after he shot the guy he screamed, 'Anyone else want to call domestic wiretapping illegal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I just found out today about the incident. You didn't know this. Turns out, Cheney tortured the guy for half an hour before he shot him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's defense is that he was aiming at a quail when he shot the guy. Which means Cheney now has the worst aim of anyone in the White House since Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy Cheney shot was wearing a bright orange hat and orange jacket, and Cheney said he thought it was a gay quail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Cheney said to his aide after he shot the guy? 'Save his heart, grab his heart!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Dick Cheney, always a capitalist. He's already capitalizing on this. He just came out with this Valentine's Day, this is new Dick Cheney cologne, it's called 'Duck.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, on Friday night at the opening ceremonies, all the Olympic athletes marched into the stadium. Did you see it? It was pretty good, yeah. When the French team saw all those people marching in, they immediately surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, a first grader in Massachusetts was suspended from school for sexual harassment. 6 years old, suspended for sexual harassment. Boy, those Kennedy kids start early, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, ladies and gentlemen. We have finally located weapons of mass destruction. It's Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, over the weekend, the Vice President wants to go bird hunting. He's going quail hunting or duck hunting or something like that. You know, horseplay. You know how that breaks out when you're out there hunting. One thing leads to another. He shoots his buddy. But here is the sad part. Before the trip, Donald Rumsfeld had denied the guy's request for body armor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about. What's more American than shooting your hunting buddy in the ass?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't get bin Laden, but we nailed a 78-year-old attorney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who got gunned down, this buddy of Cheney's...he is a Republican lawyer and a big Republican donor. Fortunately, the buck shot was deflected by wads of laundered cash. So he's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in. The global warming rally has been canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Top Ten Dick Cheney Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Heart palpitation caused trigger finger to spasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Wanted to get the Iraq mess off the front page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Not enough Jim Beam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Trying to stop the spread of bird flu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. I love to shoot people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Guy was making cracks about my lesbian daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I thought the guy was trying to go 'gay cowboy' on me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Excuse? I hit him didn't I?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Until Democrats approve Medicare reform, we have to make some tough choices for the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Made a bet with Gretzky's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't know, Dick Cheney was on a hunting trip this weekend. He 'accidentally' shot his 78-year-old lawyer buddy in the face. Now, look, this type of thing is what we call in the late-night comedy world, we call this thing a 'lob.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Making jokes about something like this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Bad analogy. It's like dressing up your friend in an orange jump suit and shooting him in a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney has been -- he's been talking to people. Apparently the guy is OK. But Cheney's had four heart attacks. Cheney's standards of health are different from our standards of health. The guy's just been shot! He's a long way from OK!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know in Cheney's condition, Cheney's had four heart attacks, should he be around guns?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's friend, the lawyer fellow, get well soon and all that. He is a lawyer. But he got shot in the face. But he's a lawyer, he can use his other face, he'll be all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big scandal is apparently is they didn't release the news for 18 hours. I don't think that's a scandal at all. Finally there's a secret that the Vice President's office can keep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the reason he didn't release the information right away is he said, we had to get the facts right. It's never stopped them in the past!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who will go hunting with Cheney now? 'Oh, hey, Dick, I'm not doing much this weekend, why? Hunting? No, I can't. Go fishing. I'm going fishing with Rumsfeld. I can't quit him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Valentine's Day, or as Dick Cheney calls it, guns and roses, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man, I dreamed I was at a Washington party, I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home. It was a nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush says you can spy on people without warrants, right? If you can torture people, hold people without trial, Cheney's thinking, 'Oh, what the hell, I can shoot a few folks, can't I?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was shooting at quail. And hit a six foot guy. In fact, Dick Cheney's shooting is so bad, today he was asked to join the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I'm surprised Dick Cheney loves to hunt so much. I mean, the five times the government tried to give him a gun, he got a deferment. What happened there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, you know, the guy that Cheney shot is a lawyer. A Texas lawyer. Yeah. In fact, while he was lying on the ground, he actually handed himself his own business card. That's how bad -- a force of habit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was reported today that the guy he shot, Whittington I think, had a mild heart attack. To which Cheney said, 'Oh, you big baby, I get those all the time, come on, walk it off!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, luckily since this guy was Cheney's buddy, he had on one of those high grade military flak jackets. You know, the kind we haven't been able to get to our troops in Iraq.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite part of this whole incident. After Cheney shot the guy, the police later showed up at the ranch where Cheney was staying and wanted to talk to him, but was told to come back the next morning. And that's what they did, they came back the next morning. Kev, that ever happen in the hood?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's say a brother shoots somebody. The cops go, 'Hey, is Jamal around?' 'No, Jamal's busy, he can't come out.' 'We'll come back tomorrow; don't worry about it, no problem! We'll come back, no problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is all over the Internet. The rumor is that Cheney may have been drinking and he wanted to wait until he sobered up. So, he may have been drinking and he shot a guy. You know what's really scary about this? Oh my God, what if it turns out all this time Bush was the smart one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did something dumb this weekend. I made a big mistake. I walked into a Muslim bakery, ordered a Danish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, this violence involving cartoons in the Middle East, it's getting scary, it's getting out of hand. You hear what happened? Just a few months ago, they announced Nemo is missing again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a fiery speech this week, Hillary Clinton, who's running for president -- no. She said she can't understand why President Bush can't find the tallest man in Afghanistan. For the same reason she couldn't find the fattest intern under the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, good news, good news today: So far Dick Cheney has not shot anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney over the weekend, him and a couple of buddies go down there and they're hunting, and horse play, they're goofing around, and the next thing you know he guns down a buddy of his. And I'm thinking to myself, if this story gets any bigger, pretty soon they're going to have to tell the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out now that Dick Cheney did not have a license to hunt, did not have a license to hunt. And coincidentally, it turns out we didn't have a license to go into Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the real question now is, is this a one-time thing or will the Vice President try to kill again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's Valentine's Day, and I hope you folks are having a lovely Valentine's Day, and everybody is in the Valentine's mood. For example, early today, Dick Cheney shot his buddy in the ass with an arrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure I buy Cheney's excuse. Did you hear why -- did you hear why it happened, why he did it? He explained today, this whole thing started years ago when he received a heart transplant from a convicted killer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush says he is standing behind the Vice President. Way behind him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got to admit, I did turn away from the Olympics, yesterday. Fox had a far more exciting sports program on. 'Softball with Dick Cheney and Brit Hume.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Dick Cheney gave an interview with Fox News. I don't wanna say Fox News is lenient. But the first question they asked him, 'Who do you like on &quot;American Idol&quot;'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the interview did get off to a bad start, when Brit Hume said, 'Mr. Vice President, I have some questions.' And Cheney said, 'Okay, shoot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you all know, over the weekend, while on a hunting trip in Texas, Vice President Cheney accidentally shot a member of his hunting party. In fact he told Brit Hume, he was actually trying to hit Cindy Sheehan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Cheney says this is the worst thing to happen to him since oil went under $60 a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Cheney now says he can't blame the shooting on the guy who got shot. He said, 'We tried for three days, it didn't work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton blasted the Vice President today for failing to disclose all of the facts. She said she wants Dick Cheney to give exact details. You know, like how do you shoot someone and make it look like an accident?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political experts are now saying that God forbid, hope nothing ever happens this lawyer. God forbid, if he takes a turn for the worst, it could force Dick Cheney to resign. You know what that would mean? You know what that means? That means George Bush is a heartbeat away from being President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is pretty upset about the way the press handled the incident. They said the press only focused on the negative side. Like, how come no one talked about the other hunting companions that didn't get shot?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Republicans went so far today, to say that what Dick Cheney did in his cover-up is no different than what Bill Clinton did in his cover-up, with his affair. In fact, you know the difference between Bill Clinton and Dick Cheney? See, with Dick Cheney, that really is a gun in his pocket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Olympic news, the United States leads in gold medals. We have six gold medals, but we are behind in bronze medals. And see, this is why I don't think President Bush quite understands it. You know, like today, you hear what he said? He said, 'Why don't we take some of these gold medals and get them bronzed?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the program, ladies and gentlemen. I just want to say something about last night's show. Last night's show was my fault. I was the guy who pulled the trigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you folks hear about this? You know, now al Qaeda says that to join al Qaeda, to become a member in al Qaeda, you must have a high school diploma to join al Qaeda. Well, that ought to keep out the losers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the comic book people have announced that Batman, Batman now will go after Osama bin Laden. So you see, Bush does have a plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg has announced he will not seek the presidency of the US. It turns out he does not meet the height requirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God. Did you guys see Dick Cheney on TV last night talking about how he gunned down that guy? Oh, boy. It was on television, and -- but I think in Cheney's favor, he won everybody over as soon as he flashed that warm, Cheney sneer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he said at the ranch down there in Texas where he shot the guy, after the shooting they had a huge roast beef dinner. A huge roast beef dinner. This guy's had five heart attacks. Why is he eating prime rib? That's what all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were suspicious when Cheney said he was going to go on Fox. And they said, well, is the Vice President -- this is the question you heard -- is the Vice President going on Fox just because they're going to ask him softball questions? That's what everybody thought. Is he just going on Fox because of the softball questions? And my answer to that was, well, does a Vice President shoot in the woods?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy President's Day, or as Hillary calls it, 'One of these days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know this is President's Day? The day we celebrate presidents from Washington to Clinton to Bush. They've gone from one who couldn't speak a lie, to one who couldn't speak the truth, to one who just couldn't speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one awkward moment there. You see this on the news in Washington? During the 21-gun salute, Dick Cheney returned fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a story I do not understand. I don't know how this happened. The United States has made a deal that will put a company based in the United Arab Emirates in control of our largest ports. They're going to be doing security. Apparently, this is called 'Operation Let's Make It As Easy As We Can For The Terrorists.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, these people barely outbid al Qaeda to get this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush said, 'Don't worry about it, don't worry, we are tapping their phones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a newly released tape, Osama bin Laden says he will not be captured alive and he is not afraid of President Bush. Oh, he's terrified of Dick Cheney. He's just not afraid of Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things not looking good for Vice President Cheney. His approval rating now 29%. If it drops any more, he may have to shoot his press secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, at one point, his approval rating was higher, but it turned out the lawyer he shot lived, and it went back down again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was, like, a one week story. It won't die. Hand me this. Here's the major magazines. Look at this, today, it's on the cover of Time. This is today's Time. Newsweek, it's on Newsweek. It's on Guns and Ammo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Harry Whittington, the man he shot, has been released from the hospital. He's 78 years old. He looked good for a man of 78. I haven't seen a 78-year-old man look that good in front of a microphone, I guess, what, since Mick Jagger at the Super Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Dick Cheney has come out with a book today about the incident. He said this will clear up all the problems. It just was released today. It's called 'A Million Little Pieces In Harry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that stare the Italian ice dancer gave her partner&quot; after they fell during the competition? &quot;Oh, my -- I haven't seen an icy stare like that since Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the strangest story yet from the Olympics, officials raided the Austrian Olympic team headquarters, found 100 syringes and 30 packs of drugs. They said it looked like it was backstage of the Grammys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are calling this the most embarrassing thing to happen to Austria since Arnold Schwarzenegger made 'Jingle All The Way,' I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, believe me, Arnold is very embarrassed for his home country. He says, now, -- he wants to go back in time and prevent this from happening. That's what he's going to do now. He would go back in time and stop the Austrians from doing things such as that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Canadian woman who was dancing in a nightclub in Ontario, Canada, did not even notice that she had been shot in the chest until she was back home in bed. Man, that Dick Cheney is everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is on vacation. Yeah, he's out in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and so far he has shot two skiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found more of this new tape from Osama bin Laden, the new audiotape. But this is a very, very important tape because in this tape he announces his Oscar picks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the tape, Osama bin Laden is very defiant and he says the United States will never get me alive, never get me alive. Yeah, I think that is probably true, he's going to die of old age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madame Tussaud's wax museum &quot;unveiled a brand-new statue of Hillary Clinton. She has a statue down there. I want to remind you I also have a statue there, everybody thinks it is the guy Cheney shot, but it's not, it's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, today was a big White House President's Day clearing sale. All our ports must go. No offer refused. No enemy turned down. Crazy George is insane, come on down!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand this. Did you know about this? The White House has given permission for a company owned by the government of Dubai to run six US ports, including the port of New York. Now, Dubai was accused of helping fund the September 11th attacks. And was one of only three countries to support the Taliban. Now, they're gonna run the port in New York. What's next, put Mexico in charge of immigration? How about Dick Cheney in charge of gun safety?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, people are always saying we can't find bin Laden. You know where I think he is? I think he's working in the basement of the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, if you heard the latest tape, you know Osama bin Laden has vowed never to be captured alive. Well, finally we found some common ground with this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has been talking about Medicare and Social Security a lot lately. He even gave a toll free number last week. 1-800-Medicare. That's the number. 1-800-Medicare. Now, if you want to find out how much Social Security money will be available to you by the time you retire, you call 1-800-You're[bleep]. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney said today, he is not sure if he'll ever go hunting again. If he does decide to go hunting again, good luck finding somebody to go with him, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's good news. Vice President Dick Cheney is on vacation in Wyoming. He needs some time to unwind and reload.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is crazy, President Bush now is apparently giving an Arab country control of US ports. Does that seem like a good idea? He's going to give control of American ports to an Arab country. If he keeps this stuff up, people are going to start questioning his judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you think about it, an Arab company running a US port, that's like putting FEMA in charge of disaster relief.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my gosh. What a crowd here. You know, you sound like al Qaeda when they heard Dubai was buying all our US ports, yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on at the White House, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Arab Emirates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has okayed a deal to let the government of Dubai control six of our major ports. First, Dick Cheney shoots a guy in the face. Now, President Bush shoots himself in the foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're turning our ports over to the Arabs. We can't even turn Iraq over to the Arabs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can see the subtle changes already. Like, in New York harbor, have you seen the Statue of Liberty? Like, now it says, 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, but no Jews!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today President Bush once again defended the move. He said America needs help at our ports to handle all the jobs we're shipping to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think that's a good idea, letting these Arab countries take over our ports? You know, this is like putting Bill Clinton in charge as manager at a Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Administration said today, that this Arab country is the best qualified one for the job. Oh, yeah. Who better to manage a sea port than people who live in the desert?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let them take over Death Valley. Keep an eye on that. Wouldn't that be more normal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, in President Bush's defense, as part of this deal, we will get back control of our 7-Elevens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? An execution was postponed here in California after a group of doctors refused to participate in the lethal injection. They couldn't go ahead because there was no doctor present. Which is a good thing. I mean, God forbid, if something went wrong and the man died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Bush now wants to end our dependency on foreign oil. Nice to see him nipping that in the bud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard this before I came out here. The United Arab Emirates says we will get our ports back if we take Michael Jackson back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Arab company is now controlling all of the ports, and George W. Bush says he had no idea that this Arab company would now be in charge of all the United States ports. I said to myself, 'Well, it's business as usual at the White House.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having an Arab company running the American ports that's like asking Courtney Love to keep an eye on your medicine cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's like hiring Britnee Spears to car pool your kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' Let's go to Washington and see what's happening with George Dubai -- I mean W. -- Bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are very upset about this port security thing. You know the story, right? We're allowing this Arab country to run our port. Why can't we get American security? Where is Gary Coleman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now says he didn't know about the Dubai port deal until after it was approved. Apparently this is part of the White House's 'Don't ask him, don't tell him' policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I believe him. Let's face it, any time President Bush tells you he didn't know what was goin' on, you gotta believe him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the sad part. Do you know how President Bush found out about it? Did you hear about this? He saw a breaking news scroll at the bottom of the 'Spongebob Squarepants' cartoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush commented today on Hurricane Katrina, so apparently he just found out about that, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they're gonna wait a week or two before they tell him about Dick Cheney shooting that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of, Vice President Dick Cheney is currently vacationing in Wyoming this week. I understand today he shot an elk. He also shot two Shriners and a Moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The media will not let go of this Dick Cheney hunting story. It was on the cover of 'Time' and 'Newsweek.' Now it's coming out on some of the outdoor magazines. I saw this one today. This is 'Quail Monthly,' and it's got a big story. There's the actual quail. The story is called, 'Nah-Nah, You Missed Me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this, President Bush is letting an Arab company run American ports. That's like letting Robert Blake take your wife to dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush said that the port deal is not a security threat. That's what he said, it's not a security threat. And remember this is the same guy who said, 'Mission accomplished,' so there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's in charge of all the US ports? Neither does President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he made this deal to give the ports to the Arabs for whatever reason. Well, now Bush is saying he was not aware that we signed a deal to give Arab countries control of our Eastern sea ports. Yeah. In fact, today President Bush began tapping his own phones so he could find out what's going on.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, he is getting so much bad publicity because of it. Today, Vice President Dick Cheney offered to shoot another guy just to take the heat off him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a speech outlining his energy program, President Bush said the United States is on the verge of a technological breakthrough that will startle most Americans. I think most Americans would be startled to hear President Bush even has an energy program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, terrorists attempted to attack the biggest oil refinery in Saudi Arabia but they were stopped at the gate. Exxon immediately announced that since the attack was completely unsuccessful and caused absolutely no damage, the price of gas would only go up 50 cents a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here was something surprising. Al Qaeda, now, if you want to be a member of al Qaeda, you must have a high school diploma. And it also helps if you've been in student council or glee club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to be a member of al Qaeda, you have to take a physical. They want to make sure you're in shape to blow yourself up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say it's total chaos over there. People walking around with guns shooting people. It's like everybody is Dick Cheney there, now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, another embarrassing moment for President Bush. On his energy tour, they asked him about alternative fuels he said, 'What? Oil is gay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Wednesday, President Bush will fly to India. See, last week, he met with American workers. This week, he'll go to India and visit their old jobs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Arab company, you know, that we are giving control of our ports -- we're giving everything to the Arabs. They're gonna control our ports. Well, they have agreed to allow a formal investigation into the deal. They agreed to it. Oh, that's big of them, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know they were running our ports. I didn't realize they were running our government, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They agreed not to exercise control for a while. See, legally, they will be in charge, but they won't be involved in the day-to-day activities. You know, kind of like President Bush is here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton says she has mixed feelings with Dubai. On one hand, they don't recognize Israel. On the other hand, they do stone adulterers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love watching all these congressmen on the Sunday morning news shows acting shocked that our government could make such a huge blunder, to which the people of New Orleans are going, 'Welcome to our world.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A New Jersey state assemblyman is introducing a bill that would give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants in New Jersey. The idea is, they say, it would take away some of the stigma of being an illegal immigrant. Of course, they'd still suffer the embarrassment of living in New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people against it. They say this is the worst idea to come out of New Jersey since the mullet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Bill Clinton is looking for 25 interns to work at his library. What could go wrong here, huh?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that great? I mean, you'd think you'd at least call them something else. But, no, he's looking for interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC's new hit show, 'Deal or No Deal,' is back on the air tonight. This is a show where contestants are surrounded with beautiful women and can walk away with suitcases full of cash. You know, this is the closest an ordinary person can get to being a member of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so cold down in Washington DC, earlier today, Dick Cheney shot the weatherman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said when President Bush arrives in India, which should be any minute now actually, he's supposed to land any minute now -- he'll have 5,000 security personnel protecting him. 5,000. I wonder if any of them work for that Arab government that Bush says we're going to trust with our ports?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, also going to visit Pakistan. I think he wants to put them in charge of our airport security.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to hold off on that Dubai port deal for 45 days, while Congress reviews the details. 45 days. Well, that should do it. I mean, those problems in the Middle East clear up pretty quickly, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this port deal, a lot of Republican congressmen announcing, 'Let's not rush to judgment.' They're saying, 'Let's investigate it, let's be sure of our facts. Too bad we didn't try that in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all this port security stuff going on, the White House is now looking back at the Cheney shooting as the good old days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new CBS News poll, Dick Cheney's approval rating has dropped to a record low 18. Not 18 percent, 18 people!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton -- did you hear about this? It's absolutely true -- took out an ad. He wants to hire interns for his presidential library. He's looking for 25 interns to fill 75 positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you want to respond to his ad, you just go to the Lane Bryant Website, and click on the link.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One girl who was interviewed for the job was so impressed -- this is unbelievable. She was so impressed with President Clinton, she sat there during the whole interview with her mouth wide open. She was hired immediately!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anna Nicole Smith was in the United States Supreme Court today. There you go, huh? The highest IQ in the land, and the lowest IQ in the land, all pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Court observers say this thing appears to be going in Anna Nicole's favor. Yeah, they said five of the justices were asking questions sympathetic that were to her argument, and the other four got lap dances from her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so cold, down at Madam Tussaud's, the wax statue of Hillary Clinton is wearing two pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bode Miller, the American skier, the big downhill guy who was supposed to have a big, big Olympics did not do very well. ... And I thought this was nice. After the Olympics, President Bush called him up and said, 'Heck of a job, Bode!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush right now is in India. He's in India. Yeah, so it's comforting to know that quick-draw Cheney has his finger on the nuclear button, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Approval ratings for President Bush -- this is staggering -- his approval rating is 38%. President Bush is so unpopular now, as a matter of fact, Dick Cheney, Dick Cheney has a higher approval rating among quail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Nicole Smith, &quot;hot babe, hot babe marries a guy who is about 100, worth $1 billion, and guess what, he drops dead. ... And it went all the way to Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court, Anna Nicole Smith. It's crazy. It's the first time in the Supreme Court that Ruth Bader Ginsberg has not been the hottest chick there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But give her credit. Anna Nicole Smith made a compelling case, so good, as a matter of fact, Clarence Thomas couldn't keep his eyes off of exhibits A and B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today at the White House, President Bush met with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Isn't that nice? Yeah. There was an awkward moment when Bush asked Berlusconi, 'How much longer till the new season of The Sopranos?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Saddam Hussein announced he has ended his month-long hunger strike. Yeah. Yeah, Saddam explained, 'I had to do something, I was starting to look like Nicole Richie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton hired a former advisor to President Clinton. Yeah. Apparently, Hillary is taking his advice because today she hit on three waitresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush continuing to talk about this port deal. He says we Americans have nothing to fear from the Dubai government.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made a surprise stop in Afghanistan today on his way to India. He didn't want to stop, but he bought his ticket on priceline.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was only in Afghanistan four hours. That might not sound like much time, but that's actually more time than he spent in the Texas National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush said the economy is great, unemployment is down, and the future looks bright and rosy. Of course, he was talking to the people of India at the time. But...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if people are watching the Saddam Hussein trial, but documents were introduced in court today that linked Saddam Hussein to a 1982 massacre. Hussein is claiming it was just a hunting accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The forecast this week, it's a high of 34 and a low of 18. But enough about the White House approval ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Bush approval rating falling to an all-time low of 34%. In fact, his ratings are so low, his new Secret Service code name is 'NBC.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insight magazine, which is a pretty conservative publication, they report Dick Cheney will resign by 2007. Well, I mean, sure. Oil is $60, Halliburton has Iraqi contracts, Dubai has all our seaports. His work is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney himself said today he just wants to kick back and spend more time shooting lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for in all this? Harriet Miers. Remember Harriet Miers? The woman studied law her whole life, yet Anna Nicole Smith makes it to the Supreme Court before she does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Heinz Ketchup Company has announced profits are down 24% in the last quarter. If this keeps up, John Kerry may leave his wife for another condiment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One tense moment when President Bush greeted by a huge crowd chanting, 'Bush, go home.' Yeah, the bad news, these were Americans at our embassy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another video has surfaced of President Bush being briefed by Hurricane Katrina. And it clearly shows he ignored warnings and didn't even ask any questions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating is now at 34%, the lowest it's ever been. ... Now, the White House is talking about bringing in a guy from Dubai to run the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Tom DeLay is saying this port deal is a big mistake. He said, if people in Dubai want to be involved in our government, they should do it through proper channels and write me a big giant campaign check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton is not only for this port deal, he's been advising the United Arab Emirates on how to go through with it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Website called Herobuilder.com is now selling a Dick Cheney action figure. And the nice thing is, the Cheney action figure fits right in your back pocket, so you can walk around, pretend you're an oil company executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney's approval rating is also dropping. Now down to 18%. In fact, the only ones who like Cheney now are the quail he didn't shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor on the Internet about this Dick Cheney shooting accident.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A White House task force is recommending to the House and the Senate that they build a memorial to the slaves who built the Capitol building in the late 1700s.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Times magazine is reporting Dick Cheney will resign in the year 2007. That's what they're saying. In fact, Cheney himself said he's going to leave when shooting guys in the face just isn't fun anymore.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Internet -- this is a rumor that was floating around. They say that Cheney was having an affair with the woman he was hunting and that she fired the shot that hit the lawyer. And Cheney took the blame to protect her.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government announced today that they are fully prepared for when the bird flu hits. The government says they are fully prepared. Do you know what that means? 'Run for your lives! We're all going to die!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book just out this week, President Bush says Osama bin Laden actually helped him defeat John Kerry in the election. Yeah. Yeah. Too bad Bush can't find bin Laden to thank him personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today his plan to fight terrorism is simple and straightforward. Go after the evil doers. Track them down. Find out where they're hiding. And then sell them our seaports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported in the papers this week even as Hillary Clinton is working to try and stop this Dubai port deal, her husband Bill Clinton was advising Dubai on how to get the deal through. She's trying to stop it, he's trying to get the deal. Forget women. Now he's cheating on her with other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Monahan, the founder of Domino's pizza, very staunch Catholic. He wants to spend at least $250 million to build a new town in Florida governed strictly by Catholic religious rules. No democratic laws. Catholic laws. Didn't we just have a government like this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that America has caused an incredible transformation in Afghanistan. He said everything's being rebuilt, people are getting jobs, kids are going back to school. In fact, the President said it worked so well over there, he's now thinking of trying it in New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was also in Pakistan, which is a little scary. Did you see that on the news? He landed there in the dark with lights off and the shades pulled down. So if you count the Dubai deal, that's the second time President Bush has been operating in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton now says she didn't know that her husband Bill Clinton was giving Dubai advice on the port deal while she was ruling against it. Hillary not knowing what her husband's doing? Has that ever happened before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton says he's looking to hire 25 interns to work in his presidential library. I was thinking about that. Could you fit 25 Clinton interns in a library?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now believed Iran has the capability to make nuclear weapons, but hasn't done it yet, which could be big trouble.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Post, President Bush has a fixation with the Oval Office rug. He likes to tell every visitor coming to the Oval Office, the story behind the rug, which Laura Bush designed herself. Now, I don't know what the story is, but I'm sure it can't be anywhere near as good as the story behind the Clinton Oval Office rug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book called 'Vital Statistics,' there are now more than 1 million lawyers in the United States. See, that's what Dick Cheney was doing -- he was thinning the herd, that's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush flew to New Orleans. Yeah, there was an awkward moment when the President looked around, and said, 'Oh, my God, what the hell happened here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Vice President Dick Cheney is donating more than $2 million to the cardiology center that treats him. Yeah. Well, actually, in Cheney's case, it's not really a donation, it's more of an advance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Post, newly retired Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been offered $8 million to write a book. Yeah. Yeah, finally, a book that captures the romance and excitement of an old man talking about interest rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I must admit, I think Congress went a little too far. Not only do they want Dubai out of our ports, listen to this. They also want the Aladdin and the Sahara out of Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in New Orleans yesterday helping out with the reconstruction. He was hammering and sawing on a construction site. Dick Cheney tried to help out and accidentally shot a guy with a nail gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the current issue of Vanity Fair, Washington lobbyist and convicted felon Jack Abramoff said he is good friends with indicted Congressman Tom DeLay, and sometimes they sit down and they discuss the Bible together.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush flew back to the White House from New Orleans. When asked about New Orleans, the President said, 'I had to get the hell out of there. Those levees don't look very safe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claude Allen, he's one of President Bush's top policy advisors, he resigned last month. You may have heard about this. Arrested for swindling Target and Hecht's department stores in refund a scam. This guy works in the White House. He would steal stuff from the store and then go to the refund department and try to get cash back. Unbelievable. And he's like real conservative. He said he's anti-gay and he supports abstinence only programs. Well, he's going to hate prison. Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not looking good. Tom DeLay is indicted. Scooter Libby is indicted. Duke Cunningham is in prison. Now this Claude Allen guy gets arrested. GOP is starting to stand for 'Grand Old Prisoners.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Russ Feingold, who I believe is running for president, he's from Wisconsin. He said, over the weekend, he's pushing the Senate to censure President Bush for spying. And Bush said, he's not worried about it. He knew it was coming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dubai said they only made the deal&quot; to buy the firm managing six US ports &quot;because it was a good financial investment. That's why they did it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know President Clinton was actually advising Dubai on the port deal? He was for it and ironically, you know when Dubai pulled out? Even they saw Hillary coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;LA and San Diego have been designated as places where officials will stop, catch and lock up the bird flu virus before it crosses our borders. Yes, siree, bob.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a remarkable speech over the weekend, Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt recommended that Americans store canned tuna and powdered milk under their beds for when the bird flu hits. Boy, that's right up there with duck and cover during a nuclear attack!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Powdered milk and tuna? How many would rather get the bird flu?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news tonight that US spy satellites are being used to track infected birds for the bird flu. Well, they worked so well in our hunt for Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a big story in the New York Times, about three months before the Iraq war, Saddam Hussein called a special meeting with his top generals to tell them he did not have weapons of mass destruction. But he did have some good news. Show the tape of the meeting.&quot; Tape of &quot;Saddam&quot;: &quot;I must report that there are no weapons of mass destruction. But I do have good news. I just saved a bundle on my car insurance by switching to Geico!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the next few months, the US will close the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. I understand they are going to sell the whole operation, lock, stock, and barrel to the Motel Six Corporation. The new slogan, 'We'll leave the leash on for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An analyst says that killing this port deal has hurt standing in the Muslim world. Oh my God! I'd hate to see anything take away from our current title of the 'Great Satan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A former White House domestic policy adviser ? and that's a big job, a guy named Claude Allen, arrested and charged with theft. He works right under the President in the White House. He was shoplifting at a Target store. And of course, President Bush was shocked. He said, 'What? Republicans don't shop at Target! What are you talking about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In front of a crowd in Florida this past weekend, Al Gore said the people of the US are going to stand up and take our country back. And then the manager of the karaoke bar took the microphone away from Al.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: The first episode of the Sopranos on Sunday was &quot;pretty shocking, Tony was shot by Uncle Junior. Of course, they said it was an accident because he was senile and didn't know it was Tony. An old bald guy accidentally shoots his friend. Where do they get these wacky stories?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you all excited about March Madness, the big NCAA college basketball tournament? Here's how it works. It starts at 65, then 64, then 32, then 16. It's just like Bush's approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a guy who used to be Bush's domestic policy adviser, Claude Allen...he is now charged with defrauding a department store. And when Bush heard about this, he was stunned, he was shocked. He had no idea he had a domestic policy adviser.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt is recommending that Americans keep canned tuna and powdered milk under their beds for when the bird flu hits. Well, that should silence critics who say the Administration doesn't have a plan to deal with the bird flu, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canned tuna and powdered milk under the bed? Where did they get this, from the witches and warlock handbook?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, if all you're using to fight the bird flu is tuna, you can starkist your ass goodbye. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also using US spy satellites to track infected birds with the bird flu. So far, they haven't caught any birds with the bird flu, but they did get two pigeons that had seasonal allergies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll by CBS News, President Bush's approval rating at an all-time low, 35%. Oh, my God. The only way Bush's popularity could go any lower is if he had a show on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know Bush's No Child Left Behind program? Now, even the children left behind are going, 'You go ahead, we're fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A newly released document shows that the FBI is now investigating Americans just for opposing the war. Maybe when we're done establishing a democracy in Iraq we should try it over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein took the witness stand for the first time in his trial this week. He spent most of his testimony ignoring the evidence, insisting that he was the real president of Iraq. Legal experts call this the 'Al Gore' strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the Dubai port deal is dead, it's coming out that former President Bill Clinton was advising Dubai on how to get it past. He was doing it on an informal basis. There wasn't anything written down. This is not the first time that Clinton has had an oral agreement that went awry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexican President Vicente Fox announced they have discovered oil under the Gulf of Mexico. In a related story, President Bush accused Mexico of having weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former White House adviser Claude Allen said &quot;it was his belief in the Ten Commandments that took him from the poor house to the White House. Unfortunately, forgetting two of those commandments could take him from the White House to the big house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's niece -- I think her name is name is Wafah...she wants her own TV show. She's an actress. She's also a singer. She went to school here in the United States and she's vocal about how much she loves our country. Isn't that ironic? The one person show business not badmouthing President Bush is Osama bin Laden's niece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton is telling people, telling America that his gut is saying that America is ready for a woman president. And I would say to Bill Clinton, that's not your gut talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview that just came out, First Lady Laura Bush says that she started exercising when she married President Bush because it was already part of his lifestyle.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today in Baghdad, Saddam Hussein called his trial 'a comedy.' Yeah, he said his trial was a comedy, yeah. After hearing this, NBC called Saddam and asked, 'What are you doing Thursday night?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did something stupid last night. One of those things you just regret after you do it. You know, I got hungry and I didn't feel like going up -- getting up and going downstairs to the kitchen, so I just ate all the canned tuna and powdered milk that was under my bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt is recommending that Americans keep canned tuna and powdered milk under their beds for when the bird flu hits. Except in LA. Here, they want us to stock up on dolphin-free tuna and fat free powdered soy milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't that sound awful? Canned tuna and powdered milk, or as they call that at the Red Lobster, clam chowder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. Okay, say you stock up on this stuff. Why under the bed? Why would you keep it under the bed? What, a bird's busting into the houses and going through the cabinet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know we actually have spy satellites tracing these incoming birds? We're now fighting the birds with our military, which is -- that's quite a comedown if you're a top gun pilot, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear the latest plans for fighting the bird flu? See what the government is going to do now? They're going to turn the Statue of Liberty into a giant scarecrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems today for the Department of Agriculture. They confirmed a case of mad cow disease in Alabama. Yeah, this is pretty sad. I mean, you know, I don't think President Bush understands this. Like, today, he urged the cow to contact all of its sexual partners and inform them immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Pentagon launched the biggest air attack in Iraq since 2003. The White House said the attack will continue until President Bush's approval rating goes above 40%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we're coming up to the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq? I'm not sure how Bush is going to mark the occasion. I think we can rule out landing on an aircraft carrier and declaring mission accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know former President James Garfield could write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other at the same time? Isn't that pretty amazing? That was Garfield. In fact, when President Bush heard about it, he said, 'What? You mean we had a talking cat for president?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes &quot;said he's stepping aside because his hearing and eye sight isn't what it used to be -- which at CBS News means, of course, he could be a fact checker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jessica Simpson turned down an invitation to meet with President Bush at a Republican fundraiser. Turned him down, yeah. Yeah, President Bush says he invited Simpson to the fundraiser 'cause he likes to be around people who challenge him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today -- big story earlier today -- the United States announced that it would withdraw most of its forces from Iceland. Yeah, so -- so welcome home, Bob and Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I tell you this bird flu is scary. Are you frightened by this? Man, I spent an hour last night rubbing Vick's Vaporub on my parakeet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for President Bush. His approval rating now dropped again. Now it's 33%. 33%? Oh, man. When he was in college, his blood alcohol was higher than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given today how low Bush's approval rating is, today he got turned down by DiTech. That's bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, this is what he said. He said he's not worried about his approval rating at 33% because he said he promises to reverse those numbers. Now I'm not mathematician, but if you take 33 and reverse it, isn't it still 33?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Jessica Simpson was supposed to speak at a Republican fundraiser where President Bush was at. But then at the last minute, she changed her mind and didn't go. She snubbed the President. You'd think maybe she'd be like her sister and pretape something. But no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm surprised that Jessica's distancing herself from the President. I mean, they have a lot in common. They're both from Texas. They're both under constant press scrutiny. And both of them have no clue about what's going on in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey by the Pew Research Center, Republicans are happier than the Democrats. Well, of course they are, they own everything!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, if you're a Republican, you get wined and dined by the oil companies, bankers, foreign investors. If you're a Democrat, you've got to go to rallies for the illegal migrant workers. Then you got to meet with the angry lesbians for animal rights. You know, that's gonna happen. You're not gonna be as happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today at the White House, true story, President Bush met with the prime minister of Ireland, who gave him the traditional bowl of shamrocks.

And he said that he's vowed that this year his...the rest of his term, he's committed to one thing. He's going to do this. He's going to disarm Iran.

And listen to this, they had offered the job to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Honest to God. They offered it to Condoleezza Rice and she turned the job now.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, we're now down to the Final Four. Not college basketball. The number of people who still think President Bush is doing a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney, his approval rating is now at 18%. In fact, he's so desperate to get his approval rating up, he's now thinking of shooting an IRS agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a survey in this week's Time magazine, just came out today, 85% of Americans think global warming is happening. The other 15% work for the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House press secretary, Scott McClellan -- announced that the economy has grown another 3%. Which sounds great, until you realize Barry Bonds has grown 30%.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A leak in the Alaska pipeline last week spilled 265,000 gallons of crude oil into the Arctic tundra. But British Petroleum, the company that runs the operation, said the spill is too small to be detected by their maintenance equipment, but just large enough to raise the price of gas 15 cents a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you bought gas this week? Isn't it unbelievable? You now have three choices -- regular, super unleaded and Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more than 500,000 people marching downtown Los Angeles this weekend to protest Congress' proposed immigration laws. And it got a little scary, I tell you. In fact, for a few hours in Beverly Hills, kids actually had to spend time with their real moms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ever see kids in Beverly Hills when their father comes home? 'Senor Papa!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart is now hiring 150,000 people to work in their stores in China. Boy, illegal immigrants thought the Rio Grand was tough to swim across, wait until they try the Pacific Ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists believe they may have located the actual Noah's Ark from the Bible in eastern Turkey. This is true. And, of course, you all know Noah, the biblical figure said to have built the giant vessel to try and save people and animals from the great flood. Or as FEMA calls him, 'Show-off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week when Jessica Simpson declined to meet President Bush at that Republican fundraiser? That was a big story about ten days ago? Well, she now says they have plans to sit down together and talk face to face. President Bush talking with Jessica Simpson, wow. That should be a real no-brainer, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands and thousands of undocumented workers protested yesterday. That was unbelievable, wasn't it? Almost a million people. And President Bush was really surprised by the large number of protestors. And you know what, I'm not surprised he was surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he travels, Dick Cheney has certain things that he needs. What he calls a downtime suite. A downtime suite it a suite in a hotel room where he can relax and take it easy, you know, when he is on the road. Coincidentally, George W. Bush also has a downtime suite, it's called the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now, a list of requirements for Dick Cheney's downtime suite. He wants bottled water. He wants decaffeinated coffee. He wants an ice bucket. He wants ammo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney wants bottled water, he wants lights on, temperature at 68, TVs tuned to Fox News. And I was thinking my God, I wish they would put this much preparation into the Iraqi war, you know, for heaven's sake!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you here. Thank you very much. It is so refreshing to see a crowd gathered in LA that's not an immigration protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, a half million illegal immigrants on the streets of Los Angeles, and that was before the protest march. That was Friday. It looked like career day at Wal-Mart. It was unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, proponents of this amnesty program for illegal immigrants say they are willing to take on jobs Americans are not willing to do. You know, like come up with an immigration policy. So far, no Americans have been willing to come up with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday, Democrats are not competent to fight the war in Iraq. This is from a guy who shot at a bird and hit a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card resigned. Finally, a Republican leaving Washington not in handcuffs. I believe that's a first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Andrew Card has spent the last five years managing the Bush White House as the ratings have steadily declined. Given that experience, today he was hired by NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is unusual for Bush staffers to leave. The President does not like change in personnel. He likes to keep the same people. I think he got this from having the same third grade teacher year after year after year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cover story of this week's Time magazine is about global warming. Pretty frightening story. You should read it. They say, if the current warming trend continues, by the year 2015, Hillary Clinton may actually thaw out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past two weeks, gas prices across the country have gone up 15 cents a gallon. So even if you're not on spring break, apparently, you can get screwed too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists say they may have located the actual Noah's Ark from the Bible in eastern Turkey. Pretty amazing. President Bush, of course, very excited about this. He said this could lead to even bigger discoveries, like finding the SS Minnow from Gilligan's Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Barbra Streisand is in talks for a concert tour this fall, where seats when will go for $1,500 apiece. Which is kind of ironic, isn't it? The country's most famous Democrat performing, and the only people who can afford to see her are Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've been watching the Senate debating the immigration bill? It's great. Every time somebody says undocumented worker, Ted Kennedy does a tequila shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Weather Service says it will be another very, very busy hurricane season. President Bush is already stock piling excuses. So he's ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Andrew Card is, the White House Chief of Staff. Andrew Card. Had the job for like five years. Well, he resigned. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Well, my God, who would leave a dream job like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yep, Andrew Card, Chief of Staff has resigned. Finally somebody in the White House has an exit strategy, so that was good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Card &quot;was talking to the President and he found himself in kind of a difficult position. Bush gave him two choices. One, he could resign or, two, go hunting with Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush surprised 30 immigrants by showing up and personally swearing them in as US citizens. Isn't that nice? ... Yeah, there was an awkward moment when President Bush said, 'You may now kiss the bride.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In France, hundreds of thousands of protesters are marching the streets. And to restore order, police have been forced to use water cannons. Yeah. On the bright side, thousands of Frenchmen can go another year without showering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, announced he will be stepping down after serving five terms. When asked why, the Mayor of Newark said, 'I've paid my debt to society.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas prices continue to go up. $3.10 a gallon today in Los Angeles. In fact, you know those 500,000 people marching in downtown LA this past weekend? They were not protesting. Just commuters.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush watched the protests on TV. I don't think he got it. He said he thought it was Cinco de Mayo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush gave a big speech about immigration reform. I don't know. Is President Bush really the best guy to talk about entering another country illegally?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news is Congress is cracking down on illegal immigration. The bad news, a head of lettuce will now cost $300.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This problem of illegal immigration is nothing new. We've had this for a long time. In fact, the Indians had a special name for it. They called it, 'White people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know both Jack Abramoff and Monica Lewinski went to Beverly Hills High School? Did you know that? And ironically, they both went on to embarrass presidents with scandals about the same thing, getting something under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest from Iraq. The government there has ceased to function. There's factional fighting everywhere. The religious fundamentalists. So it's kind of like the White House, but with more oil, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is headed down to Cancun, Mexico. Do you have the same thought I had? Huh? Sounds like he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'd think if any president would be going to Cancun during spring break, it'd be Clinton. I'm surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In St. Paul, Minnesota, city hall there removed a display of the Easter bunny with the eggs and everything, and they took down the sign that said 'Happy Easter' 'cause they thought it might offend non-Christians. It's a good thing, yeah. You wouldn't want anything Christian tainting a city called 'St. Paul.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How come people want to take God out of Easter? Nobody wants to take Satan out of Halloween. Why is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today in parts of the world there was a total eclipse of the sun. ... President Bush says the eclipse of the sun proves the unreliability of solar power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, speaking of President Bush, right now he's in Cancun, Mexico. He's down there looking for tequila of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, resigned. You aware of that? He's been replaced by a guy named Josh Bolten. There's also still an opening for a guy on Condoleezza Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Mexico this week, and while he's there, he's going to visit the ancient Mayan ruins. Yeah, apparently Bush is trying to learn from his mistakes because today he promised that FEMA will help the Mayans rebuild.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest statistics, there are now 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Yeah. Here's the part that surprised me. Over half of them are on the Yankee pitching staff.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is down in Mexico right now. Again, you know, I don't think President Bush gets it. You know? Like, as soon as he stepped off Air Force One, he looked around and he said, 'Wow, you've got a big problem with Mexican immigrants down here, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush is down there to meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox. And they get along well, 'cause they have a lot in common. They're both ranchers. They both love the outdoors. And they both speak English as a second language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about France? Big riots in France. Over there, rioters were looting stores. Actually, you have to be politically correct, you can't call them looters anymore, they're now 'undocumented shoppers,' I believe is the term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats said they have a plan to find the leader of al Qaeda. Find the leader of al Qaeda? They don't even have a plan to find the leader of the Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, it's time for the people of Iraq to put together a functioning government. This is what he said. He said it's time to 'Shut 'er down and get governing.' That's what he said. 'Get governin'!' You know, our other presidents will quote Lincoln and Roosevelt. Bush is the only one to quote Larry the Cable Guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Time magazine, global warming is 33% worse than we thought. Do you know what that means? Al Gore is one-third more annoying than we thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff sentenced to nearly six years in prison. Well, see, I'll tell you, that shows you the unpredictable life of a Washington lobbyist. One day you get $1 million from the tobacco lobby. The next day, being traded for a couple of cigarettes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news. After a three-year run, Hooters Airlines announced it's calling it quits, closing its doors. Yeah. And today, President Clinton said, 'The terrorists have won.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Cancun. The only President I know that takes spring break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's down in Mexico he's holding a meeting about illegal immigration. Well, glad to see he's nipping that in the bud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday -- this is true -- President Bush told the Iraqi people to, this is a quote, 'Get governing.' Then, the President introduced his new speech writer, Larry the Cable Guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush attended a summit in Mexico and thousands of Mexicans attended a rally to protest his immigration policies. Yeah. The protest was cut short because the Mexicans had to get back to their jobs in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow is April Fool's Day. Or as a lot of people are calling it, President's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Bush is back from his Mexican trip, and while he was in Mexico, the people were very nice to him. In fact, a lot of the people greeted him with the only English phrases they knew, 'Welcome to Wal-Mart. Can I help you?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment when President Bush was sight-seeing and they took him to see the ancient Mayan ruins. And when he saw them, he turned to the President of the Mexico and said, 'We'll get the scum that did this.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was down there, President Bush spoke about the immigration problem. You know how out of hand immigration is, there were 800 more people on Air Force One coming back than when he flew down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was revealed today that a one-time driver for President Clinton -- the guy who was driving President Clinton around was in the country illegally. President Clinton. I mean, I never thought I'd see the day when Clinton would be involved with someone who is illegal. Now someone barely legal, yes. But illegal, shocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in the Senate they passed a bill, a limited ethics bill, which is something Congress knows a lot about. Limited ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new reality show on WB tonight called 'Survival of the Richest.' Each week someone gets eliminated while on a hunting trip with Vice President Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And two movies open tonight, 'Basic Instinct 2' and 'Ice Age 2,' which is perfect -- a movie for Bill and a movie for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, turning our attention to the world of television, Joe Pantoleno is getting a new series right here on CBS. The interesting thing about this, President Bush knew about it and did nothing to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in Mexico yesterday, this was the latest, President Bush was greeted by protestors wearing President Bush masks. Yeah, the President was overheard saying, 'I don't know who those people are, but their faces look familiar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The immigration bill before the Senate has sparked a huge immigration debate in this country. One of the biggest facts, of course, is health care. Treating illegal aliens in hospitals is enormously expensive. I have a solution. They should come to me. Here's what we do. Okay? You treat illegal Mexicans with cheap Canadian prescription drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush supports a guest worker program, but opponents of the guest worker program claim it takes jobs away from Americans that people in India could be taking away from Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police and Senate officials said the US Capitol evacuated today. The Capitol was evacuated after the electric power went out. People said it was the quickest loss of power in Washington -- well, since Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, happy birthday to Al Gore. Al gore turned 58 over the weekend, 58 years old. I don't want to say Al Gore is boring, but his party broke up before they finished singing the song, 'Happy Birthday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study involving 1800 patients and six major hospitals failed to prove the healing power of prayer. They said prayer does not work in healing, no. There goes the Republican healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A British terror cell was caught trying to smuggle bomb ingredients inside shampoo bottles in Great Britain. Yeah. It wasn't the X-ray machines that gave them away. It was the actual bottle -- hand me that, would you? See, this is it here. 'Your hair smells terror-rific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, was opening day, and President Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds-Chicago Cubs game. Like Bush, it was high and to the far right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see what happened after Bush threw the first pitch? Dick Cheney shot an old guy in the upper deck.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, UCLA, they haven't won a championship since the mid-90s. Like the Democrats, nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Florida, the Gators got a congratulatory phone call from President Bush. And the UCLA shot so badly they got a phone call from Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the huge rainstorms here in California. It is unbelievable. We have so much rain, President Bush declared LA a seaport today and handed management over to the city of Dubai.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush threw out the first pitch in Cincinnati. President Bush is a huge baseball fan, did you know that? Did you know? He once wanted to be a professional baseball player, but he, you know, just didn't have the qualifications. Luckily that's not a requirement to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An incident last night at the Padres-Giants game, when Barry Bonds was walking off the field in San Diego, someone threw a syringe at him. Did you see that? Threw a syringe at him and landed right at his feet. Luckily, it turned out it was just his trainer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, indicted former Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay announced he is resigning from Congress and will not run for re-election. People were shocked. A Republican with an exit plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, they say this will be the first time Tom DeLay actually takes a vacation he pays for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book that's coming out about First Lady Laura Bush -- this is interesting. I guess Laura was reportedly very critical of how Hillary decorated the White House when the Clintons lived there. According to the book, Laura said she was appalled -- appalled when she saw the garish colors in the Oval Office. Yeah. Wow, it's a good thing she didn't have one of those black lights, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beautiful Jennifer Anniston on the show tonight. She's got a new movie out called 'Friends with Money.' I understand it was written by Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Basic Instinct II' came in tenth on its opening weekend. It came in tenth! That's unbelievable. Oh, man, they're saying it was the worst idea for a sequel since the Iraq war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at opening day in Cincinnati, President Bush threw out the first pitch. Yeah, then the President started crying because the manager took him out of the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this one of those you want to just take a shower stories.

I think the terror alert has been raised to creepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why Republicans can't have sex scandals, you know? They're just too creepy. The Democrats -- the hookers, the mistresses, the interns. Not girl scouts!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom DeLay announced he's quitting Congress and giving up his seat. Actually, he's not giving up his seat, he's selling it to the highest bidder on eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he said he wants to spend more time taking illegal campaign contributions from his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, you know what bothers me the most about DeLay, it's not the scandal, it's not the golf trips or the money laundering. You know what it is? Show that picture. Look at this. It's the hair. Ok that the hair, okay? This guy is older than I am. You know what -- you know what he's been using? This is what they all use, 'cause they know they're going to be on TV. This is new, 'Just Indicted for Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book about Laura Bush claims that Laura was very critical of how Hillary Clinton decorated the White House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A second Homeland Security official has been arrested, a 49-year-old guy named Frank Figueora.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. Who is going to protect us from the Department of Homeland Security? You know, maybe these guys should start tapping each other's phones instead of ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to try and make the Bush environmental record look good, Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced today that under the Bush Administration there are now more wetlands than in any time since 1954. Yeah, if you count New Orleans!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom DeLay said he made this decision to resign himself. See, I don't know about that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kev, I gotta tell you, I had a horrible nightmare last night. I dreamed it was take your daughter to work day at Homeland Security. It was horrible.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security -- one of the head guys, the Deputy Press Secretary, a guy named Brian Doyle, arrested for trying to pick up 14-year-old girls online. Ooh. Now, it turns out another Homeland Security official was arrested for exposing himself to a teenage girl at a mall. You know what's really creepy? These are the same people in charge of patting us down at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Middle-aged men trying to pick up underage girls? You know how these two guys could have avoided all these problems? Just e-mail each other and pretend to be teenage girls. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And their lawyer -- ah, their lawyer, just as sleazy. Did you hear the defense he came up with? Did you hear about this? He said all the men were trying to do was lure terrorists into a trap by assembling a team of 72 virgins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom DeLay announced he will not seek re-election, is giving up his seat in Congress. He said he wants to concentrate now on not having to give up his seat in prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know Tom DeLay will still get to collect over $1 million in congressional pension money? That's what's great about Congress. The only place in the world where the robbers get to keep the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this past weekend, the Miss Iraqi beauty pageant was held in downtown Baghdad. The winner received a bouquet of roses and the title of Miss Iraq. Then, the other contestants joined her on stage, where they were all stoned to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And hurricane season less than two months away. There's no joke here. I just want to give FEMA a heads up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A prostitute said in 'The New York Times' this week that she keeps track of all her earnings and fills out a tax form each year and sends it in. She says she wants to do the right thing and be a tax paying member of society. Is that amazing? I mean, how ironic is that? The only person in the world who refuses to screw the IRS and it's a hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is having a hard time lately. ... Yeah, yesterday -- this is the latest. In a speech, he was giving a speech, President Bush accidentally referred to the Senate immigration bill as the 'Senate energy bill.' Afterwards, the President apologized for his mistake, and reminded everyone to support our brave troops in Norway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't get about this -- I mean, they've got oil, these citizens love the United States, they want to come here. Forget Iraq, we should have invaded Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, the Senate decided they couldn't make any progress on this immigration reform bill, so they closed up shop and went on vacation for two weeks. Hey, try that at your job, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know all those people who come across the border, willing to work hard? I say make them senators. They couldn't do any worse job than these guys are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bill they were trying to pass, basically, the bill they were trying to come up with would allow illegals who have been here more than two years to work towards becoming American citizens. Now does this work? I mean, if your argument is illegals do the work Americans won't do, when you become Americans, does that mean they won't want to do that work anymore, either?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a lot of huge marches around the country yesterday to protest the immigration laws. These marches had quite an impact on businesses. Restaurants had to close. Construction sites had to close down. The Yankees had to forfeit a game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You realize Americans are now doing the job immigrants won't do, because they're out protesting. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this new bill that's tied up in the Senate, illegal immigrants who can prove they've been here two years, would be allowed to stay. So, follow the logic. If you can prove you broke the current law for two years, you're protected under the new law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know our cowardly idiot Congress left on a two-week spring break. This is the biggest bunch of do-nothings. They didn't do anything! They just left and went on vacation. So apparently, Congress also on a temporary worker program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard something big's going down in Washington today. But enough about President Bush's poll numbers. Not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that guy in the news that got arrested for jumping the fence and running towards the White House? Pretty scary. Luckily, pretty easy for the cops to catch him. The guy stood out like a sore thumb. Right now, everybody's running away from President Bush.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Washington Nationals' baseball game today. Talk about irony. He threw the ball, hit a quail, and killed it. What are the odds?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alec Baldwin told Elle magazine he is so desperate for a Democrat to be the next president he would go a month without sex if it meant having a democrat in the White House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney, excited about baseball. As a matter of fact down in Washington, he was there to throw out first pitch for the Washington Nationals' game. It was a nice day.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Bush's childhood home in Midland, Texas, will be officially turned into a museum. Yeah. Yeah, so -- so it turns out that the President has been to a museum.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Activists are talking about organizing a 'Day Without Immigrants' day on May 1st in which all illegal immigrants would stay home from work. Or as it they call it in Beverly Hills -- the 'day I have to watch my own kids day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of people in Beverly Hills worried about this day without immigrants. You know, they have no idea where the lemon Pledge is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Demonstrators around the country sang, 'We shall overcome.' And in Mexico, millions of demonstrators sang, 'We shall come over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember what the government did to help find terrorists who are on the loose in Iraq? Do you remember they had come out with playing cards with the photo? Well, now they're doing the same thing. The government's coming out with these -- these are the immigrant trading cards. You guys will see this, they've got all different faces.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know the story, Moses crossed the border with thousands of people. He was chased by the army, he wandered the desert for 40 years. No, I'm sorry, that's the Republican plan for illegal immigrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm coming to work today. I pass three guys walking down the middle of the street, shouting and waving signs. Turns out it was a demonstration of all the legal immigrants in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say there are something like 12 million illegal immigrants in the country right now, another 500,000 coming every year. Remember last election, when the Democrats claimed there were two Americas? Turns out one of them was Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Bush left the White House to begin a long weekend at Camp David. It's only Thursday. But Dick Cheney told Bush, 'Look, you've done enough damage. Go ahead. You're fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House said today that the Administration plans to become increasingly vocal about the high oil prices.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Cheney, still getting a lot of flak for throwing that first pitch into the dirt at the baseball game on Tuesday. It just kinda went like that, and it went in the dirt. Whereas when President Bush threw out the first pitch in Cincinnati last week, his was a perfect strike. But then, on the other hand, Dick Cheney can read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that George Bush's childhood home in Texas has been turned into a museum. Unfortunately, once you get inside, you can't find your way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a huge controversy here in California over a state Senate bill that would require all students to study gay history. Or, you could just watch the Tony awards and get extra credit. I'm not sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's being called the largest drug bust ever, authorities in Mexico seized an airplane with $100 million worth of cocaine in it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another one of those chilling videotape messages from al Qaeda. This one was from their number two guy, the number two guy in al Qaeda.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is tax time, and President Bush is saving a lot on taxes this year. Where you aware of this? Oh, yeah, he is doing quite well, President Bush. As a matter of fact, he is writing off his entire second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran has announced, here is the quote, 'We are a nuclear country. We are a nuclear country.' You know what is scary about that? The president of Iran knows how to pronounce nuclear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqis are going to court to change their names so they won't be identified as either Shiite or Sunni Muslims. That's right. Yeah, reporters got the story from Iraq's spokesman, Mohammed O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon admitted that it's been spying on gay groups. ... The government said they didn't find any terrorist cells, but they did learn that this fall, Prada is bringing back round-toed pumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, April 15th -- tomorrow is tax day. The day when legal Americans wish they were all illegal Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also its Easter. So while people are hiding Easter eggs from the kids, they're also trying to hide their nest egg from the IRS.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Did you know the average American works until lunchtime every day just to pay his Federal state and local taxes. All the work you do up to lunchtime goes to the government. So if you're going to fool around at work, do it in the morning on the government's time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the government now allows you to write off some weight loss plans on your taxes because the Bush Administration considers obesity a disease, as opposed to the Clinton Administration, which considered obesity sexy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a UCLA study, 7% of people still believe in the Easter bunny. I believe these are the same people that believe President Bush is doing a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A total of six, first it was six, then the seventh one today, retired generals -- generals, big guys, have called for the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld. Yeah. But not all the generals are against him. Not all of them are against him, he still has the support of a lot of generals -- General Electric, General Dynamics, General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was on this day in 1865 that President Abraham Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theater by actor John Wilkes Booth. It was also the beginning of a feud between Republican presidents and actors that continues to this day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A professor at USC wrote the story on Kobe Bryant. He said that Kobe is not very popular with his fans. ... He said, 'Kobe has about as much street cred as Dick Cheney.' Actually, Cheney has more street cred. He actually shot a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it's tax season. Earlier today, Dick Cheney shot up an H&amp;R Block.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way tomorrow, the anniversary of the sinking of the 'Titanic.' That's too bad, very sad. It sunk after it struck an iceberg, and we'll never see a disaster like that in our lifetime because all of the icebergs have melted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House annual Easter Egg Hunt. Oh, my God, it's this weekend. And, you know, the kids this year have some extra help because President Bush came out on the lawn and leaked the location of the eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush issued an Easter proclamation. ... This is a quote, 'This is a season of renewal, and for remembering that hope overcomes despair.' Nice, yeah. Then he said, 'Let's not forget those delicious marshmallow peeps.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Presidents, earlier this week, former President Clinton was giving a speech in Washington, DC, and someone in the crowd yelled out, 'We miss you.' Yeah, I should mention that Clinton was giving the speech in the Champagne Room at Crazy Girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' What a crowd. You sound like you're all getting tax refunds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is tax day, which is kind of a change of pace, you skip one day getting screwed at the gas pump, you get screwed by the IRS.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney getting a tax refund of $1.9 million. How do you get a $1.9 million refund when your salary is $205,000 a year? Apparently he was writing off the guns and ammo as business expenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, kind of an embarrassing moment during his taxes while he was doing them. On the dependents, he listed Scooter Libby, Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff. Then he caught himself, 'Dependents, oh, I thought they said defendants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continued to be those seven retired generals that have come forward and called for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to step down. In response to that, President Bush said he fully supports Rumsfeld. Sounds like somebody's going on a hunting trip with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That shows you the difference between the Administrations, you know. Bush can't control his generals, whereas Clinton could never control his privates. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the -- today was the big Easter egg roll on the White House lawn. They didn't call it a hunt this year, 'cause, you know, in case Cheney showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom DeLay, did you see him? He was busy dyeing his eggs with the same stuff he uses on his hair. I thought that was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time, a large number of gay families were involved this year. In fact, these are the first same sex couples at the White House, I guess, since Charles and Camilla.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I seem a little up set to you people tonight, it's because something ugly happened to me earlier today. Six former generals called for my resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this, former generals are calling for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation. And I thought this was odd, they also want to get rid of that Ace Young from American Idol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld is defiant. He says he is not backing down and says he will stick around and let people criticize his handling of the Iranian invasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Washington DC, today is the annual White House front lawn Easter egg hunt. It is a big, big annual event. The kids found so many eggs it was unbelievable. I'm thinking, 'Maybe they should send the kids to look for Osama bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was a lovely day and a festive occasion. The kids found quite a few eggs and hundreds and hundreds of Cheney's shell casings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the White House sponsored the annual Easter egg hunt on the South Lawn. The winning child found 6 eggs and 14 lobbyists hiding in the bushes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday's celebration was marred when three of the kids tested positive for steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, President Bush welcomed some gay couples to the White House Easter egg roll. In fact, he recognized one couple and said, 'Didn't you used to be Governor of New Jersey?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is asking for an extension on his taxes. He's still trying to decide whether to write off Donald Rumsfeld or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Rumsfeld is in trouble, but this morning, they found him hiding in a spider hole. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On CNN today, a retired Air Force colonel said that US military operations are already under way in Iran. You know what that means. Time to break out the old 'Mission Accomplished' banner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to ESPN magazine, the president of Iran may attend this year's world cup soccer game. They say his visit will be kept secret because of security reasons. Apparently, the only people who know are the people who read ESPN magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of China, President Hu Jintao, he arrived in the United States today. His first stop was Seattle. He went into a store to buy some souvenirs to bring home, got a little frustrated. He said, 'You guys have anything that's not made in China?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security announced they will be ready for dealing with hurricanes in the future. Like today, they called their cable company and ordered the weather channel. So, they're on the right track.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Magician David Blaine announced his latest stunt. He's gonna live underwater for seven days and seven night in a human aquarium in front of New York's Lincoln's Plaza. Live underwater for seven days -- yeah, the people in New Orleans are going, 'Great. Well, good luck to you. Let us know how that works out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the name of this trick is called 'Waiting for FEMA.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. In the words of the new White House Chief of Staff, if you're thinking of leaving, now is the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House, the Bush Administration, says that they want to declare all golf course water hazards as federally protected wetlands. It's part of their effort to save restricted country clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I don't understand. Earlier today, six retired Army generals called for the retirement of Regis Philbin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These retired generals have another demand. They also want Sizzlers' Early Bird Special to start at 4:00.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize this, 100th answer anniversary of the devastating San Francisco earthquake. 100 years ago. 1906, 100 years ago. San Francisco, devastating earthquake. FEMA is on the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in the news. We're about to go to war with Iran. A woman in Los Angeles has the bubonic plague. Iraq is still a mess. But the big story, Tom and Katie had their baby, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more good news, President Bush creating thousands of new jobs. The bad news, they're all in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, staff members have been leaving the White House in droves. Today, press secretary Scott McClellan stepped down. Said he wanted to spend more time lying to his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Scott McClellan quits. The chief of staff Andy Card quits. Domestic policy adviser Claude Allen, he quits. You realize the only one in the Bush White House without an exit strategy is President Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now I know why Donald Rumsfeld doesn't want to resign. The line's too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a Pentagon briefing, Donald Rumsfeld said, 'We are making progress, and we're very close to capturing some high-ranking officials.' Unfortunately, they're all retired US generals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese President, President Hu Jintao visiting the United States. He arrived like most foreign visitors to the US -- through Mexico, snuck across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in the United States, the President of China plans to make the rounds of Wal-Mart stores doing inventory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So China's president meets America's president. It's like President Hu meeting President Huh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have discovered more oil in Mexico. See, this could solve our immigration problems right there. Make every illegal alien carry one barrel across, okay? We'd be bringing in 3, 4, 5 million barrels a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NBA playoffs start this weekend. The Knicks not in the playoffs. I don't want to say the Knicks are playing badly, but today, President Bush announced they have his full support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people, they get on the tramway, and they're going to Roosevelt Island, and some people are coming back and both trams get stuck and they are up there like six hours dangling above the river.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the arrival ceremony was interrupted by a protester who said, 'Stop the persecution, stop the torture.' President Bush had to ask, 'Which one of us are you talking to?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice, the President of China gave President Bush a traditional Chinese gift, a pirated bootleg copy of 'Mission: Impossible III' two weeks before it opens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after lunch the Chinese President had some harsh words for President Bush.&quot; &quot;President Hu,&quot; via translator: &quot;Someone please tell President Bush that Panda Express is not real Chinese food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush tried to put together some entertainment for President Hu. But you know Bush, he's not too popular with performers. The only guy they could get was William Hung.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Gates told the Chinese President if he has any problems ever with his Windows on his computer, he can call him personally. Well, that's nice, isn't it? The world's top communist has a problem, he gets to call Gates directly. Americans can't get the Windows to work, we have to talk to Apu in India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday press secretary Scott McClellan resigned. I'll tell ya, people in the White House are dropping faster than old guys hunting with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McClellan said he knew he was getting burned out on the job the other day when he accidentally told the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is kind of ironic, isn't it? I mean, either Iraq is having trouble forming a government, while President Bush is having trouble keeping the government he formed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger meeting here in California tomorrow. Their goal? To butcher the English language in a way that could never be duplicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Record temperatures in Texas. Over 100 degrees in Texas. So hot, 3,000 people without power today. Actually 3,001, if you count Tom DeLay, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore coming out with his first movie. It's called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' It's described as a detailed scientific view of global warming. President Bush said he also saw a film on global warming, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown.' So much better than that boring Al Gore movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To help President Bush get ready, his staff printed up a book where President Bush could learn about the Chinese president. He was up all night reading it. Do we have it here? Here's the book here. It's called, 'Horton hears a Hu.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, in his speech welcoming the Chinese president to the White House, President Bush said the two nations are divided by a vast ocean and connected by Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, during the big meeting, Vice President Cheney fell asleep. Although the White House said he was just reading his notes. ... Look, look. He's reading his notes with his eyes closed. That is the same way he hunts, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Chinese President Hu said that our two countries are growing closer. Growing closer. In his speech, President Hu said that China is providing more democracy and freedom for its people. And President Bush said our government is moving closer to China's system of spying on people without warrants and holding people in jail without trials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, we're talking about building a great wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this when a Chinese woman started yelling and protesting at President Hu? And President Bush tried to cover it up. Did you see this? 'Ladies and gentlemen, Connie Chung! Ladies and gentlemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Caracas, Venezuela, you know how much a gallon of gas costs there? 12 cents. See, I feel sorry for senior citizens on fixed income. They have to drive to Venezuela to fill up the tank to drive so they drive up to Canada to get cheap prescription drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an interesting Senate race going on in the state of Montana. It's between the incumbent Conrad Burns, who is being investigated from getting gifts from Jack Abramoff, and a Democrat named John Morrison, who held a press conference with his wife to announce that he cheated on her. Nice to see both parties getting back to their roots. The Republicans are still stealing. The Democrats are still cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's have some good news. The good news is the stock market is the highest it's been in five years. In fact, Heinz Ketchup stock went up so much this week, John Kerry fell in love with his wife all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome. What a crowd. You sound like Dick Cheney when oil hits $74 a barrel. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, how quickly things change, huh? Easter was, what, a week ago? We were bending over hunting eggs. Now we're hunting gas and bending over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced his plan to increase the number of barrels produced. You hear his plan? He wants to make smaller barrels.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching that movie 'Mad Max' on cable. Remember that movie? Remember that movie where gas is so precious, that people are killing each other over a few gallons? It was set in the future. I believe it was August!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To counteract the bad publicity that they're getting, the oil companies plan to introduce full-page ads explaining where your gas dollars go. Yeah. Explain that. Explain where you get gas for a dollar. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, there was an incident at the White House when the Chinese president, President Hu, was giving a speech and the woman started heckling him, yelling at him. Finally, President Bush had to say, 'Hillary, not now!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton is &quot;advocating what she calls a smart wall along the Mexican border. It'll keep track of people using infrared cameras, remote control airplanes and electronic devices. Yeah, that will work, right? She couldn't keep track of Bill in the White House, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one embarrassing moment last week when Vice President Dick Cheney apparently fell asleep at a White House meeting between President Bush and the Chinese president. You see that? Wouldn't have been so bad, except Cheney likes to sleep in the nude, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan, has resigned. See, Vice President Cheney does not have a press secretary. He says he likes to let his guns do his talking for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, Kenny Rogers tried to go hunting with Dick Cheney just so he could get some free work done on his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush met with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Both of them left the meting with the same comment ? 'What'd he say?' 'What'd he say? I don't know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Orange County -- the President is still here -- he was talking about immigration. President Bush said that massive deportation is unrealistic. He says you can't just move 12 million people to another country. I don't know. Mexico did it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Mexico, Governor Bill Richardson -- this is unbelievable -- Governor Bill Richardson said he is still undecided about cock fighting, which is not banned in New Mexico. It's still legal. This is what he said, he said there are arguments on both sides. Really? What is the good argument for cock fighting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Camden, New Jersey, are warning people to be on the lookout for what they call 'killer heroin.' They say it's being sold by people who don't care about the quality of it and they're putting poison in it. So please, only buy your heroin from a reputable dealer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in New Jersey, health officials announced they can't account for two vials of missing anthrax. The good news, if you live New Jersey, you probably are already immune.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday, Queen Elizabeth of England turned 80 years old over the weekend. The Queen, want to wish her the best. She is of course a figurehead who holds no political power. In this country, we'd call that a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Congress are demanding that President Bush investigate whether the oil companies are gouging consumers on these gas prices. That's a good idea: Republicans asking Republicans to investigate other Republicans. And you know who they're going to blame? The Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is furious. They want to know how come these oil company profits are so high, but the money they get under the table has remained the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a sign at a gas station near my house that says, 'We take Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express.' After I filled up my car, they took my Visa, my MasterCard...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor in Washington is that President Bush is about to hire Fox News anchor Tony Snow to be the new White House press secretary. His job will be to defend everything President Bush does. It's basically a lateral move from Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger over the weekend. Arnold asked the President about disaster relief, immigration reform, and more federal dollars to California to fix the levees. President Bush asked Arnold if Danny DeVito really was his twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a speech in Orange County on immigration. As he spoke, the crowd grew larger and larger. That was just from more people illegally immigrating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new White House Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten, has put together a five-point recovery plan to help put President Bush up in the opinion polls. How about five-point plan for getting out of Iraq? Wouldn't that push the opinion polls?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new al-Zarqawi video. He's the number-two man [in al Qaeda]. I believe we've now killed the number-two man 380 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his latest audiotape, Osama bin Laden says the Bush Administration is evil, it's made excuses to attack Iraq, and is obsessed with Middle Eastern oil. If Osama bin Laden keeps talking like that, he could wind up the Democratic front-runner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said this week he's thinking about running for president again, but he hasn't made up his mind as of yet. That should put an end to the rumors about him being indecisive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Houston, professional sleazeball and former Enron executive Kenneth Lay took the stand. He also took the pens, the stationery, the chains, a couple of old ladies' 401(k)s...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech this week, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said that America needs to work together to conserve oil. Then Arnold lit a cigar and drove over the crowd in his Hummer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new issue of 'Rolling Stone' magazine features a cover story about President Bush titled, 'The Worst President in History.' President Bush said, 'That's not fair -- I'm also the worst President in math, English, and geography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources close to President Bush say that the next White House press secretary is going to be Tony Snow. The Fox News anchor said, 'It'll be great to have a job where I can be less pro-Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said this week to help with the gas prices, he will temporarily ease environmental regulations. Well, that's great, huh? So not only will we not be able to drive, now you won't be able to breathe either.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Congress are now demanding President Bush investigates whether the oil companies are engaged in price gouging. Putting the White House in charge of investigating the oil companies? That's like putting Dick Cheney in charge of gun safety, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in a town hall meeting, President Bush told a 14-year-old boy that one day, people will drive hydrogen-powered cars. When the young boy asked President Bush how he knew that, Bush said he saw it on 'The Jetsons.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was in Orange County the other day, President Bush said he wants more temporary guest workers, you know, like he has at the White House now pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has picked former Fox Newsman Tony Snow to be the new White House press secretary. In a newspaper column -- this is true -- the guy he picked, Snow once said about Bush that he was an embarrassment, a leader who has lost control of the Federal budget and the architect of a listless domestic policy. Good thing for Snow Bush doesn't read the newspaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The immigration debate goes on. Senator Hillary Clinton says she wants a smart wall at the Mexican border. The only thing that could defeat a smart wall, smart Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, new portraits were unveiled of former President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, and the Smithsonian said the portraits of Bill and Hillary will not hang in the same room. Talk about art imitating life, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I'm surprised they did a portrait of Hillary. I thought maybe an ice sculpture would be more appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Enron President Ken Lay said the company collapse was due to a witch hunt. It's a witch hunt. That's what he called it, a witch hunt. It is a witch hunt. I want to know 'which' one of these bastards stole all the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush introduced his new press secretary, Tony Snow, and the President said, this is a quote, 'His job is to help explain my decisions to the American people.' Yeah. Then Bush turned to Snow and said, 'Good luck, you poor bastard.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton said she is in favor of building a wall between and Mexico and the United States. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'She means a metaphorical wall of silence and resentment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little commotion in the White House today. Did you hear about this? Dick Cheney was firing a shotgun in the air to celebrate Exxon's announcement that it made $8.4 billion in profit last quarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exxon made $93 million in profit a day last quarter. A day. They've now screwed more people than Bill Clinton and Paris Hilton combined.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now wants Congress to eliminate the $2 billion worth of tax breaks they gave to the big oil companies. $2 billion. Do you realize that equals the retirement benefits of five Exxon oil executives?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new White House press spokesman is Fox News channel's Tony Snow. This is the White House's third new face in two weeks, which breaks Kenny Rogers' record, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made a surprise visit to Iraq yesterday. The surprise visit. He's still Secretary of Defense, I guess. I guess he went to Iraq to get away from all the hostilities beginning in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been announced that White House adviser Karl Rove will not be creating the day day-to-day policies for the President now. They call him Bush's brain. No, that's what they call him, Bush's brain. Now he's only going to be working part of the time. You know, just like Bush's brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Senate panel has recommended getting rid of FEMA. They want to close FEMA down. I tell you, in six or eight weeks when FEMA hears about this they're going to be furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A St. Louis woman who crashed a car after suffering a heart attack while at the wheel was saved by two nurses and a defibrillator salesman who happened to be passing by.

Well, who else has -- well, except Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite record profits and sky-high gasoline prices, today, Exxon Mobil denied that they've engaged in price gouging. They denied it, yeah. ... A spokesperson for Exxon Mobil said, 'We prefer the term, 'Kicking America in the nuts.''&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, gas prices are so high, today Governor Schwarzenegger had his Hummer towed. Oh, he had plenty of gas in it. Just the tow truck got better mileage.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arnold Schwarzenegger is blaming man for global warming. And today, Al Gore agreed with him. That's so typical. Two cyborgs, 'Oh, let's blame the humans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush say he's wants to find alternative sources of energy. He says they're looking towards solar power. In fact, he and Rumsfeld are planning an invasion of the sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week, President Bush introduced former Fox broadcaster Tony Snow as the new White House press secretary. See, this is a great example of wasteful government spending. I mean, why is the President paying someone to join his staff and toe the party line when he was doing it on Fox for free?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big controversy over the fact that a version of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' has been released in Spanish. President Bush said today that the national anthem should be sung in English. And then he repeated his statement in Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said today, 'It's bad enough the song starts with the words, &quot;Jose, can you see?&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you ready for the big immigration walkout on Monday? Or as Wal-Mart is calling it, self-service day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest videotape of Osama Bin Laden says that the Bush Administration is evil. It has made excuses to attack Iraq, and it is obsessed with Mid-East oil. So basically, Osama has the same platform as Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new Senate report just released advises that FEMA should be abolished. That sounds a little drastic, doesn't it? What are we going to do without FEMA? I guess we could ask the folks in New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take-Your-Daughter-To-Work Day &quot;is a holiday invented by a quick-thinking Ted Kennedy when he was seen leaving his office with a 19-year-old girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Saddam Hussein's 69th birthday, how about that, 69th birthday, Saddam Hussein. He is in a room alone cut off from his wife and relatives, and that's punishment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam says that he doesn't want any gifts for his birthday. What Saddam really wants is a California jury, that's what he wants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that Spanish-speaking immigrants should learn to sing the national anthem in English. That's what he said, yeah. The President said that's only fair, since he learned all the words to 'The Macarena.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very busy, though, the President. Earlier today, at a press conference, this is true, President Bush said that when it comes to hurricane preparedness, step number one is to 'pray that there's no hurricane.' ... Later, Bush admitted, 'actually, that's our entire plan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a poll, and they said Condoleezza Rice is the most popular member of the Bush Administration. Yeah, experts say that claiming to be the most popular member of the Bush Administration is like claiming you got 'the good kind of herpes.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, today was 'Don't take your illegal immigrant to work day' here in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All across the nation, today is what they call 'A day without immigrants.' That's what they were calling it. Or as Native Americans call it, 'The good old days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illegal immigrants -- well, they walked off their jobs -- skipped school today. And to teach America a further lesson, people now leaving Mexico refuse to sneak across the border until tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what they called it, 'A day without immigrants.' Here's my question -- did Governor Schwarzenegger go to work today?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, businesses were closed, streets were closed, everything was closed except that big hole in the fence down by the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal today, they say Mexico has changing demographics. For example, in 1968, the average woman in Mexico had seven children. Today, the average woman has two children in Mexico. The other five, she has in the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all know about the big controversy over the new version of the national anthem being sung in Spanish? A lot of people are not happy about it. But the good news -- now at Major League ballparks all around the country, for the first time, the players can understand the song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is oil always controlled by people we don't like? Have you noticed this? Saddam Hussein, the Ayatollah of Iran, the dictator of Venezuela. Do you realize the last oil guy we liked was Jed Clampett?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Bush was in New Orleans, he said, 'We pray there is no hurricane this coming year.' This is what's called 'faith-based disaster management.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a US Senate probe, a recommendation made that FEMA be abolished and replaced with a totally new agency. However, they said many of the FEMA employees -- the former employees, can join and work for the new agency. So apparently, it was the name that was the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush impersonator, Steve Bridges...was with the President, he did a great job&quot; at the White House correspondents dinner. &quot;In fact, when Steve Bridges walked in, Bush said, 'Oh, my God. This cloning thing is amazing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steve Bridges looks so much like the real President Bush, two White House staffers handed him their resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big drink of the Correspondents dinner this year was something called the 'Cheney Shot.' ... The bartender pours a shot of Wild Turkey and then throws it in your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said that with Rush Limbaugh, the charges will be dropped if he stays off drugs for 18 months. Or as Courtney Love calls it, 'A death sentence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Orleans saints drafted Reggie Bush this past weekend. People in New Orleans are hoping maybe this Bush will actually do something to help the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so beautiful today in New York City, here's what I did. I pretended I was an immigrant and took the day off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State is the most popular member of the Bush Administration. Most popular member of the Bush Administration. That's like being MVP of the Knicks, thank you very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Anna Nicole Smith. And I'm telling you, I guess that lap dance for Clarence Thomas paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended the NFL owner's meeting today -- and told them he wants two NFL teams in Los Angeles. Not one, he wants two teams. That way we can have a legal team and an illegal team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was a big May Day immigration strike. Or as we call it in LA ? 'Sicko de Worko.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people called in Mexican yesterday? I'm curious. 'My grandmother was Mexican. I'm not coming in. I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the big May Day demonstration. Or as Wal-Mart calls it ? 'Mayday, we have no cashiers!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To show solidarity, Britney Spears' husband, Kevin Federline, he said if he had had a job, he would have stayed home also.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a strange day all across the country. Immigrants took to the streets. About a half a million here in Los Angeles. Hundreds of thousands in New York, Chicago, Houston. In Salt Lake City, three guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I don't understand? I asked this question. They're making all these demands. If we don't meet the illegal immigrants' demands, what do they do? Leave?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokesman for the immigrants said today that they made their point yesterday. And they will never have to stay home from work in huge numbers like this again -- until Friday for Cinco de Mayo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Friday is 'Cinco de Mayo.' You know what that means? That means, 'We outnumber you 5 to 1.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cinco de Mayo celebrates the Mexicans driving the French out of Mexico in 1862. Well, thank God they won. Imagine if the French had won? Oh, my God. Imagine having 12 million illegal French immigrants in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again, I don't think President Bush fully understands this immigration thing. Today, when they asked about amnesty, he said, 'Well, it's horrible when anyone loses their memory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To stir things up even more, a British music composer has come out with a Spanish language version of our national anthem. Which is great for Americans. Now, we have two versions we don't know the words to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times today said Senator Joe Biden wants Iraq divided into three regions -- Sunni, Kurd and Shiite. And the Republicans want it divided into Exxon, Mobil and Texaco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a National Geographic study, one-third responding to the survey could not find Louisiana on a map. And those are just people that worked at FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House announced this week they will not spend $1.6 billion to upgrade the levees in New Orleans. You know what we should do? The people of New Orleans should elect Saddam Hussein as their next Mayor. Between the oil they already have and Saddam as the Mayor, the White House will send troops down to there to get rid of him and then spend billions fixing the place up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House correspondent's dinner the other night -- Vice President Dick Cheney did not attend. The Secret Service said it was unsafe to have both of them in the same place. Actually, they consider it unsafe to have anybody and Dick Cheney in the same place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said her childhood dream was to be an Olympic athlete. But she was not athletic enough. She said she wanted to be an astronaut. But at the time, they didn't take women. And she wanted to go into medicine -- but hospitals made her woozy. Should she be telling people this story? She's basically saying she wants to be president because she can't do anything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We already have that guy. We have that guy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously for Anna Nicole Smith. How about this? The nation's smartest helping the nation's dumbest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agricultural officials announce they have found bird flu in New Jersey. But not to worry. They say if any of the birds get out, New Jersey's natural toxic waste will kill them on the spot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA came in and tested the New York City drinking water. It's cloudy. We're being fined. I want to tell you something, if you don't know this, New York City water is cloudy. It's cloudier than a Rush Limbaugh drug test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Signs Gas Is Expensive: 10. It's so expensive, Batman is patrolling the streets on a Schwinn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's so expensive, Starbucks is selling Gasaccino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It's so expensive, it's negatively influencing our foreign policy, hurting millions of hardworking Americans and threatening to throw our economy into absolute chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It's so expensive, Anna Nicole Smith married the night manager of a Texaco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of legal and illegal aliens staged what they called 'A day without immigrants.' Yeah, or as it's known in Utah ? 'Monday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York, tens of thousands of immigrants gathered for the protest, tens of thousands. Yeah, reportedly it was the most immigrants gathered together since baseball's spring training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A mild form of bird flu has been detected in New Jersey. Yeah, health officials said the bird flu was hard to detect because in New Jersey, every bird coughs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you saw this on the news here in Los Angeles. Over 100,000 people walking in the streets today. Nothing to do with immigration, just SUV owners going to work, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw one guy today say that Monday's march was part of a national coming-out strategy. That's what he said. And he compared being Latino to being gay. I think it's easier to tell your parents you're Latino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the leaders of the immigration groups...said that our country's immigration laws show that we're a racist country. We exploit minorities where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And then the reporter said, 'What does he want? US citizenship.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, Mexico moved forward on a plan to decriminalize small amounts of drugs. Drugs like cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy may soon be legal in Mexico. How about that? Well, I just hope it doesn't corrupt a place like Tijuana, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new geographic literacy study claims that less than four out of ten American students can find Iraq on a map. Yeah. And of course President Bush has the opposite problem. He can't find his way out of Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Capitol Hill, the head of Exxon met with the Republican Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert. Big day for the Speaker. You know, you always want to be on your best behavior when the boss shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC is reporting that Secret Service records show that convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff visited the White House over 200 times in a 10-month period. 200 times -- that's more times than President Bush was in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton told a crowd of college students that she was speaking to that when she was younger, she wanted to be an astronaut. That's what she wanted to be. Imagine if Hillary had become an astronaut. I mean, what would Bill be saying to women then, you know? 'But Mr. Clinton, aren't you married?' 'Yes, but my wife is no longer on this earth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anna Nicole Smith won her case in the Supreme Court, ladies and gentlemen. Yes. I believe this is the first time a bunch of old guys have given her something and lived to tell about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled -- I was stunned by this -- that Anna Nicole's argument made sense. See, that's how you can tell that the current Supreme Court has been reshaped into the George Bush mindset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the heaviest person in the world is a man in Mexico who weighs 1,200 pounds. In fact, he once tried to cross the border but was stopped by authorities in California, Arizona, and Texas.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was talking to a friend of my in Washington at the weather bureau. He was saying don't kid yourself, this global warming is deadly serious.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, President Bush participated in a Cinco de Mayo celebration at the White House. Again, I think he gets confused. He spoke to the Spanish people today. Well, here. Take a look.&quot; President Bush: &quot;Thank you for giving me the chance to come by and say -- mozoltov!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Patrick Kennedy celebrated Cinco de Mayo a little bit differently. Used his car as a Pinata.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Capitol Hill Police said Thursday, 2:45 in the morning, a quarter to three, Congressman Pat Kennedy almost hit them with his car, and crashed into a barricade. They said he was driving on the wrong side of the road with his lights off. His speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot. And when he got out of the car after the crash, he appeared to be staggering. They said they notified their superiors and were told, 'we'll handle it.' So, apparently, the case is now being investigated by the Department of Rich White Guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear his excuse for hitting the barrier? He said he had to swerve to avoid Ted Kennedy, who was crawling home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Well, I guess the apple doesn't stagger too far from the tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Kennedy blamed his seemingly intoxicated state on a sleeping medication. I believe it was called 'Jagermeister.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what we should do, the next time a Kennedy gets in a car in late at night, wake up Dick Cheney, have him shoot out the tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are now blaming their problems on sleep medication. Yeah. Like today, President Bush said he took Ambien right before he invaded Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC News reported that CIA Director Porter Goss did not resign. ... They now say he was fired, and apparently didn't know it was coming. Which is pretty bad, when you're head of the CIA and you don't know what's coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that he's not...going to replace him just yet. He's going to start a guest worker CIA Director program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Vice President Cheney's daughter's new book, she says that when she told her father she was gay, he said, 'I just want you to be happy.' Which is the same thing he told the oil companies when we invaded Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new Mission Impossible movie, Tom Cruise &quot;is Ethan Hunt, and in this Mission Impossible movie, it is the most impossible mission so far. He has got to try and get the President to pull his numbers up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are celebrating Cinco de Mayo &quot;down in Washington, DC. At the White House, a confused George Bush lit a menorah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;69 years ago today ladies and gentlemen, the Hindenburg crashed and burned 69 years ago. At the time, the Hindenburg was the biggest thing to go down until, well, Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the White House today, President Bush gave a Cinco de Mayo speech to an audience of Mexican Americans. That's right, yeah. There was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'Isn't it amazing that Cinco de Mayo always falls on May 5th?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Ted Kennedy's son, Congressman Patrick Kennedy, crashed his car but got out of a breathalyzer test by claiming he was on his way to the Capitol to vote. Yeah, apparently Kennedy was gonna vote on whether Miller Lite is less filling or tastes great.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice, warm California. I tell ya, it was so hot today I was sweating like Patrick Kennedy trying to get car insurance, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Geico said to Kennedy, 'We can't save you any money. Don't even think about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you stop a Kennedy from driving? Concrete barrier!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police report said -- luckily nobody was injured, that's why you can joke about these things. But they said Kennedy's eyes were red and watery. His speech was slurred. And his balance was unsure. Yeah, see, that's how they identified him as a Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the Fraternal Order of Police said it took Patrick Kennedy 19 hours to come up with his explanation of what happened. It still beats his dad's old record by two hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who do you think had more excuses this past weekend? Kennedy or the Lakers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's tip for Laker fans. You might want to take some of Kennedy's Ambien, it will help you forget what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now that Patrick Kennedy blamed the whole incident on sleep medication that he was taking. That's what he said. He said he couldn't remember getting out of bed in the middle of the night and leaving his home. Today Bill Clinton said, 'Good answer, good answer!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kennedy checked himself into a drug rehab clinic this weekend. And you know, he gets that 25% Kennedy family discount.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a commencement speech at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday, President Bush told graduates the job market is the best it's been in years. Well, sure, look at all the openings just in his Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen this video the Pentagon released last week of the number two al Qaeda leader, what's his name, al Zarqawi? Fumbling with the guns -- he's got the guns? The number two guy is fumbling with the guns. What is it about the number two guy and guns? They can't seem to shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story that kind of got lost with the Kennedy thing. CIA Director Porter Goss has resigned. He said he wants to spend more time spying on his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has nominated Air Force General Michael Hayden to be the new head of the CIA. Hayden is a controversial choice 'cause he's the guy who was in charge of the wiretapping program that spied on American citizens without warrants, you know? And he said he understands the concerns of those who would oppose his nomination. He also has their names, addresses and exactly what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told a German newspaper in an interview over the weekend that his best moment since he became president was when he caught a 7 1/2 pound fish in his own lake. See, sometimes these Bush fishing expeditions they can pay off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said catching a 7 1/2 pound fish was his best moment since becoming president. You know the sad thing? A lot of historians would agree with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actress Michelle Rodriguez's character &quot;gets shot on last week's episode of 'Lost,' but the week before, days in jail after pleading guilty to a DUI. She went to jail for drunk driving. See, that's what happens when your last name is Rodriguez and not Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The director of the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency, Porter Goss resigned, surprisingly, I guess on Friday he resigned. He says he wants to spend more time giving bad intelligence to his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they named a replacement for Porter Goss, big surprise, Rosie O'Donnell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the Kentucky Derby on Saturday? A horse named Barbaro won. And what a thrilling race. But there was trouble. Did you see it near the finish line? Barbaro, the winning horse had to swerve to miss Patrick Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw something very disturbing, coming to work this morning on the freeway. A van coming from Mexico -- 45 people crammed inside it. They weren't illegal. It's just that gas is so expensive, they were carpooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, OPEC has lowered the price at just under $70 a barrel. Bad news -- that's just for the barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people working at the gas stations are getting so cocky now. I'm getting gas this morning, the attendant says to me ? 'It's $3.89 a gallon. Deal or no deal?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas is getting so high, this morning I saw Patrick Kennedy and Rush Limbaugh car-pooling to rehab together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for Congressman Patrick Kennedy after the car accident the other night. According to police reports, he acted disoriented and his speech was slurred. Today, he was charged with impersonating Paula Abdul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And although Kennedy denies he was drinking -- you know, you can't lie about this stuff. It just makes it worse. The hostess at bar called the Hawk and the Dove said he was in the bar and he was drinking. That has the name of the bar. The Hawk and the Dove. Sounds like some place John Kerry would hang out. 'I'm against the war, I'm for the war.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, President Bush's approval rating has dropped to a new low: 31%. In fact, his ratings were so low, today he was named an honorary member of the NBC family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In recent memory, only four presidents have had lower approval ratings ? the president of Exxon, president of Chevron...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave an interview to the German newspapers. He told the interviewer that the German people do not like war. You can't say Bush doesn't know his history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran has written a letter to President Bush. Among other things, the Iranian president attacked President Bush's policies and says democracy is a failure and claims America is hated all over the world. He ended the letter by calling America the great Satan. But other than that, it was a nice letter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the letter right off. Donald Rumsfeld said he's investigating the letter. And the CIA said, 'We got a letter from Iran?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That convicted terrorist, Zacarias Moussaoui now says he lied about his involvement in 9/11. He said, 'I was just kidding!' He wants to change his plea now to not guilty after he was convicted. See, apparently he expected the death penalty, where he would have died and received 72 virgins -- as opposed to life in prison and placed in prison with 72 guys looking at him like he's the virgin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush understands how&quot; bird flu &quot;is spread. Like, today in Florida, he urged seniors who eat dinner before 4:30 to be careful of the 'early bird flu special.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ABC movie &quot;Fatal Contact,&quot; &quot;The bird flu movie, here's what it is. Government officials, the bird flu is coming. Government officials are slow to react to the growing disaster. Seriously, where do they come up with this stuff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After holding his breathe for seven minutes, illusionist David Blaine &quot;was shaky. He was disoriented but he was able to walk on his own. Oh, no, no, no. That was Patrick Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he could only do seven minutes so I guess the old record still belongs to Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are very upset that Congressman Patrick Kennedy was not given a blood alcohol test after his but, you know something?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Iran has written a letter to President Bush. I tell you, this Iranian president is very smart. To make sure Bush read the letter, he wrote it on Exxon stationery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pentagon experts say there may be no defense against flying robot bombs. Did you read about this in the paper this week? These are small remote control airplanes that can carry bombs. The Pentagon says they're too small to show up on our radar. And they're especially dangerous when experts at the Pentagon go on TV and tell terrorists these are too small to show up on our radar!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russia still very upset about recent comments Dick Cheney made about that country.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy, the president of Iran, sent George Bush an 18-page letter from the president of Iran, to George Bush, 18 pages. Yeah, like he's going to read that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mother's Day also the busiest long distance phone calling day of the year. Over 300 million long distance calls. And those are just the ones being monitored by the White House.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the last few years, the NSA has been collecting the records of tens of millions of phone calls made by Americans. In fact, when he heard they had records of all the calls, today 'American Idol's' Chris Daughtry asked to see them. 'I want to check. I think there's a mistake.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on Florida television, President Bush said he'd like to see his brother Jeb become president. Hey, great campaign slogan, 'Jeb Bush, couldn't do any worse!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush's approval rating, all-time low, 31%. You don't know how bad it is. If Bush could run again in the next presidential election, he would get beaten by the bird flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran wrote a letter to President Bush. Do you know about this? And it seems now that's caused some problems. Turns out it's a chain letter. Now Bush has to send it to ten other world leaders...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FEMA has closed their office in New Orleans. I guess they want to get out of there before hurricane season starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States is losing billions of tourist dollars from overseas because foreigners from countries that don't support the war don't want to come here. See, this is why you've got to admire Mexico. Mexico didn't support the war, but that hasn't stopped them from coming here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study released this week, in the last ten years oral sex among teenagers has doubled. So who says there's no Clinton legacy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Cruise did all his own stunts in the film&quot; Mission Impossible III. &quot;Did you know that? Except for the car crashes, those were done by Congressman Patrick Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you can tell summer is just around the corner, ladies and gentlemen. Earlier today Dick Cheney injured an old guy in a fishing accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government is now monitoring telephone calls of millions and millions and millions of Americans. ... Honest to God, if the governments had been monitoring my phone conversations, by God they should be paying half of my phone sex bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed the $70 billion tax cut capital gains and it's all part of President Bush's no millionaire left behind program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a guy in Washington, DC, just a guy, and he is searching through garbage and he finds, you know what he finds, he finds a copy of President Bush's travel plans. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I signed up for a new calling plan today. The NSA friends and family plan. You know about this? 100 bucks a month, they listen to all my friends and all my family.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, the National Security Agency has been collecting phone records on millions, millions and millions of ordinary Americans. So this Sunday when you call your mom to wish her Happy Mother's day, don't forget to take a moment to say hello to President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is denying all this. He says this secret plan is strictly targeting terrorists. Hey, forget terrorists -- how about targeting telemarketers, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that Americans now believe that Bill Clinton is more honest than President Bush. At least when Clinton screwed the nation, he did it one person at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to address the nation Monday night on the immigration issue. Bush said he would have given the address tonight, but they couldn't get the 'mission accomplished' sign finished in Spanish soon enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is asking the networks to make room Monday night during prime-time for a speech. Well, that should be no problem for NBC, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an exclusive interview this week with NBC's Kelly O'Donnell, Vice President Dick Cheney says he does expect go hunting again. Of course, no guarantee he'll bag another lawyer, but hey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times reported that despite all the dire predictions that migrating birds will bring back the bird flu, has not happened. In fact, all the swallows that returned to Capistrano this spring were healthy, except for two birds that stopped on the way in Tijuana and got Chlamydia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you. All right. Settle down. This is starting to sound like an Exxon shareholders' meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I look a little frenzied, if I look a little harried, if I look a little rattled, if I look like somebody has just taken me and shaken me, if I look that way it's because today coming to work I got a lift from Patrick Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mission Impossible III &quot;is Tom cruise's most impossible mission yet. His mission now is to keep the Kennedys out of trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the idea of the movie. It's the USS Poseidon. It's a huge luxury liner cruise ship. There's some kind of problem. Isn't there always some kind of problem? And the big huge Poseidon thing goes belly up. It's just like President Bush's second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush talked to the nation tonight in a primetime address earlier this evening. Which is a refreshing change, Americans listening to the President as opposed to the President listening to Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, he outlined a plan to start patrolling the US/Mexican border using members of the National Guard. He said that this will give us the most secure border in the world. One weekend a month and two full weeks each summer.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, this will replace our old method of border security, the honor system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He also said if the guards meet with any resistance, they have orders to shoot on the spot, any Wal-Mart executives that interfere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Thursday, the President will follow up his speech by going to the Arizona border, which will be historic. It will be the first time he's ever actually showed up with a National Guard unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest Harris Poll, President Bush's approval rating now at 29%. In fact, it is so bad, yesterday on Mother's Day, Barbara Bush refused to take his call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, here's the part I don't understand. The day before, his approval rating was 31%. Now, it's 29%. What happened overnight? People don't like the way he slept?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And since when is 29% considered an approval rating? Isn't that more of a disapproval rating?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he should at some point just stop doing the job all together and see if it goes up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what phone number you dial to reach the NSA? Any number at all. They're right there. You pick up, they're right on the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government now has this secret program to track every single phone call being made in the United States. So guys, next time you dial something like 1-800-hot girls, that heavy breathing you hear on the line could be Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, earlier tonight, President Bush announced a new program that combines the NSA and illegal aliens in a guest listener program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the only reason they're listening to our phone calls is for security reasons. Okay, okay. Let's say it is security, well, what if the Amish are planning something, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of gas was so high, &quot;Today, Congressman Patrick Kennedy walked into a concrete barrier.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very scary moment for Senator Ted Kennedy. He's flying back to Boston after giving a commencement speech at a college, when his eight-seater airplane struck by lightning. He's fine, but the lightning hit the plane so hard, it spilled all 15 of his drinks, bam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC aired their last episode of 'The West Wing.' 'The West Wing is over. Yeah, last night. Well, we're not worried. See, we have another show I think is much closer to the real president. 'My Name is Earl.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the season finale of 'West Wing.' It's gone, did you realize that, that's it for 'West Wing,' and ABC has cancelled 'Commander in Chief,' so now the only fictional president is Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush addressed the United States about immigration. And this is odd, during the speech he laid out his proposal and then he tried to hold his breath for nine minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is sending National Guard members to the Mexican border. I'm telling you, between Iraq and the Mexican border, the National Guard is stretched tighter than Joan Rivers' face.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush announced a big change in immigration policy. He's gonna get one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is proposing sending 6,000 National Guard troops to bolster patrols along the US/Mexican border. Or, as he's calling it, 'No Juan left behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said last night, 'You can't take millions of people with deep roots in the country and send them across the border.' Really? Mexico did it. What's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said these troops will be at the border temporarily, you know, until Mexico is ready to govern itself. Sound familiar?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush also said last night, 'We do not yet have full control of the border.' Full control? If we had any less control, there'd be an E-Z pass lane, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said in his speech that immigrants have to learn English. The immigrants said, 'Hey, you first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watching the President's speech last night. You notice, there was nothing on his desk, show the picture. If you're the leader of the free world, you know, shouldn't you at least have a stapler?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A British scientist has built a car he claims gets 8,000 miles on a gallon of gas. And today, Dick Cheney invited the guy to go hunting with him and a couple of buddies from Exxon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Men's Health magazine, it costs men an average of $10,000 to have an affair. $10,000 or as Bill Clinton calls it, 'Deal!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a &quot;great episode of '24' last night. More intrigue, lying, cover-up, electronic eavesdropping, or as the White House calls it, 'Reality TV.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush thinks it's time we do something special about illegal immigration. I'm thinking, 'My gosh, he nipped that in the bud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says, before immigrants can become citizens of the United States, they should be able to speak proper English. Be able to speak proper English, except for the word 'nuclear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what they're going to do now at the Mexican border, according to President Bush. The Mexican border will now have surveillance cameras and motion detectors. Our borders will be as secure as the Gap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's everybody's nightmare. Ted Kennedy is flying somewhere up in New England over the weekend, and the aircraft was struck by lightning.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush announced a plan to send 6,000 members of the National Guard to patrol the US/Mexico border. That's his plan, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech the other night, President Bush called for the National Guard to patrol the US/Mexican border. The guards will track down and find illegals, which -- that's not their job. I mean, they're trained to defend our country, right? Not track down and find people. Let's be honest. The Guard couldn't even track down and find President Bush when he was in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says we'll have 6,000 troops on the border for one year, preferably an election year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, conservative republicans are very worried that there's no way to keep track of all of the illegal immigrants. We can't keep track of them unless of course they start making phone calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The film actually features Al Gore and explores his journey on how he first got interested in temperature change. Like, it started back when he was Vice President. He would notice how the temperature would change. Like, whenever Bill would walk into the room, it would get warm. And then when Hillary walked into the room, it would get cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forbes magazine just came out with a list of the richest people in the world. And 80-year-old Fidel Castro, Mr. Communism, near the top of the list. They say he's worth over $900 million. In fact today, when she heard that, Anna Nicole Smith hopped in an inner tube and starting going to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very proud to say everyone in our audience tonight is a member of the United States military. What they didn't tell you -- right from here, you're going down to guard the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me welcome you to NBC. I must say the only place in the world with more bombs than Iraq, ladies and gentlemen. Right here, NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to you men and women across -- the world is a safer place. Unless, of course, you're an old guy and hunting with Dick Cheney, then it gets a little tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I finally saw 'Mission: Impossible' the other night, or as we call it, the President's plan to stop immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In regard to the immigration policy, President Bush said the other night, we have to remember that every human being has dignity and value. Apparently he doesn't watch a lot of daytime television, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of these illegal immigrants come to the United States to do the jobs Americans are unwilling to do. Like today, a guy named Esteban from Guatemala married Liza Minnelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian prime minister asked President Bush, 'When was the last time you were down under?' And Bush said 'Oh, you must be thinking of the other US President, President Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the British newspaper, The Independent, in an interview, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said one of her favorite all-time songs is Rocket Man by Elton John. That's what she says. She said the song reminds her of her first boyfriend in college. 'Rocket Man,' so either the guy is very fast or very gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, Americans say they now trust Democrats more than Republicans to deal with Iraq, the economy, immigration. In fact, if the election were held today, John Kerry would still lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out now that they think FBI is now looking, they got a tip and the FBI are looking right now for Jimmy Hoffa. Everywhere. The FBI, looking, and I'm thinking that's great. But what about Osama bin Laden?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI, in their defense, claiming they have a lead on where the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa. They said he was last seen on a duck hunting trip with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is writing another book. And this one is going to be -- the first one was an enormous book. And it was his life story. And then the next one is going to be a fascinating book. In the book Clinton describes one time when an intern held her breath for nine minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today -- this is big news -- the Senate voted to build a 370-mile fence along the Mexican border. Yeah. 370-mile fence. Yeah. Experts say a 370-mile fence is the perfect way to protect a border that is 1,900 miles long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says he is not sure whether his grandparents entered the United States legally. Yeah. As a result, President Bush has sent the entire Gonzales family back to Ireland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Russ Feingold got into a shouting match over the issue of gay marriage. They were screaming at each other, yeah. As a result, Specter and Feingold have cancelled their wedding in the Florida Keys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon announced today the Iraq's border is 90% under control, which is pretty impressive when you realize San Diego's border is only 20% under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is insisting that it would be cruel to take a hard-working person reaching for the American dream and just send them home. Hey, 'American Idol' does it every week, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Guard stands by, ready to go into action any time the President of the United States feels it's a big enough disaster, like a major earthquake, a huge flood, a 29% approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is pretty serious about this enforcement thing. In fact, before he left the border, he put up a scarecrow of Dick Cheney with a shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the White House Spokesman, Tony Snow, said it was not just a photo opportunity, no sirree bob. Apparently, President Bush was down there looking for some guys to do landscaping around the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, he has nothing but respect for Mexico and its people and he will always speak the truth to them. Here's my question -- when can we get that deal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate voted to make English the national language. More bad news for President Bush. Now he's got to learn that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate voted 63-34 to make English the official language of the United States, but they say it is a largely symbolic amendment with no real effect, you know, kind of like the ethics bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in India, the India stock market plunged 600 points, the largest crash in its history. Economists predict as a result, Indians could lose thousands of former American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A realtor in Ogden, Utah, inspecting a townhouse found 70,000 empty beer cans left by a former tenant. Isn't that unbelievable? I didn't know the Kennedy's had a place in Utah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this now, President Bush is sending troops to the Mexican border. He's going to have them look for tequilas of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to get into the United States, you have to have legal documentation, or a 95-mile-per-hour fastball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hunting accident was really only bad for two people, for the Vice President, of course, and the guy who got shot. For us here it was tremendous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess everybody knows now about the NSA, the National Security Agency. They been assembling a database, millions and millions and millions of phone calls place placed by Americans last year, and they're recording them, and we're being wiretapped, they're listening in on our conversations. My line has been tapped since the 50s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I called a friend of mine, Doug, down there at the NSA, and I said, 'look, I know they've been tapping my phone, can you get me my phone records? He said, 'I'll see what I can do.' Take a look at this. They've got every call, every time. This is just page one. There have to be 100 pages here. Domino's Pizza, Elite Escort, Domino's Pizza. Let's skip ahead. Let's skip ahead again, you see it's Domino's Pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States border with Mexico is over 2,000 miles long. Were you aware of that? But only six inches wide.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty historic weekend. The lines to see the Da Vinci Code were actually longer than the lines to sneak across the border. That's the first time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA announced today they have a new lead on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. They think he might be hiding in a movie theater showing 'Poseidon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI, continuing their search for Jimmy Hoffa. They said today as soon as they find Hoffa, they're going to start looking for Justin Guarini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush has proposed sweeping immigration changes. This is pretty amazing, when you consider before he became President, Bush thought immigration was the sincerest form of flattery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Bush signed a huge tax cut bill. He's hoping this tax cut for the rich will attract a wealthier, more affluent group of illegal immigrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Border Patrol agents in Arizona today discovered 91 illegal aliens being smuggled in the back of a van. But here's the problem. Now, there's the van. That's the actual van. Now look at the sign. Can you go in close? See? 'Maximum capacity, 84 illegal aliens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has passed a resolution to make English the official language of the United States. When asked if they approve of the resolution, 75% of the people in Los Angeles said 'Si.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey has written a book where he says -- the former governor says he used to cruise highway truck stops looking to have sex with gay truckers. How many times have we seen this? Just another government official screwing the consumer at the gas pump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a TV show, Pat Robertson said -- and I quote, this is his quote. He said, 'If I heard the Lord right, the coast of America will be lashed by storms this year.' He actually said, 'If I heard the Lord right.' What? You weren't paying attention?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine Moses doing that. 'There was some commandment. I missed two of them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton has signed another book deal. We have an advance copy of his new book, it's right here. It's, 'The Five People You Meet Under My Desk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now believe they may be able to teach birds grammar. It is your tax dollars at work, by the way. And if they succeed, teaching grammar to the birds they are going to try the same thing with President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love this story. Louisiana Congressman William Jefferson -- wasn't he married to Wheezy? Is that the same guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, he was videotaped, got him on tape accepting a $100,000 bribe. He said he will not resign, even though the FBI agents found $90,000 of it in his freezer. In Washington, that's known as a bribesickle, apparently, when you put it in the freezer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has really unified both parties. In fact, House Speaker Dennis Hastert -- he's a Republican ? that guy's a Democrat -- has attacked the FBI for raiding the congressman's office, saying it was abuse of power. Imagine the nerve of the FBI treating members of Congress like they were regular Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's anything the people who make the laws hate, it's being treated like the people who have to follow the laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the Republicans said this raid may have violated protections for Congressmen that are spelled out in the Constitution. The Constitution! All of a sudden they found a copy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexican President Vicente Fox arrived in the US today. So it's official. He's the last one. Turn out the lights. They're all here now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has passed a resolution to make English the official language of the United States. In fact, today President Bush said this is the goodest news he's heard in a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to recent polls, 84% of Americans approve of making English the official language. You know, I'd be happy if they made English the official language of 7-Eleven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is here in California to try and boost the campaign for several Republican candidates out here. How low are you in the polls when you bring in Cheney to help you get your numbers up?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But see, Cheney loves California. See, out here, rich and famous people can shoot other people and get away with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new autobiography, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, who resigned because he was a crook -- this is the guy's story. He revealed that he used to cruise highway truck stops looking for gay sex. Say what you want about the guy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, we have a copy of his new book right here. It's called, 'My Search For a Mandate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a shocking statistic. One out of ever 136 Americans are currently behind bars. Even more shocking, one out of every three Kennedys is currently in a bar right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Egypt says they're going to excavate what appears to be a 2,000-year-old Roman city submerged in the Mediterranean. It's been underwater for over 2,000 years. They're going to dig it up now. You thought FEMA was slow. Boy, how bad was that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists said today that some of Christopher Columbus' remains are buried inside a Spanish cathedral. The rest of the remains are buried somewhere on a farm in Michigan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so nice today, Al Gore said, 'Hey, this global warming is not so bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this country, global warming is so bad, we are now actually starting to warm up to Barry Bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Trade Commission has ruled that the oil companies are not gouging customers. That's right. They have ruled that the oil companies are not gouging customers. They say technically, they're screwing customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vicente Fox, the president of Mexico, arrived in the United States today for a state visit. Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately, Fox was caught at the border and sent back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told reporters that he won't see Al Gore's documentary about the threat of global warming. He will not see it. Yeah. On the other hand, Dick Cheney said he's seen the global warming film five times, and it still cracks him up.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's President Vicente Fox is visiting the United States. He's a great guy, this guy. He's one in a million. Well, 1 in 12 million, really, if you want to count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Vicente Fox wanted to get here before we tighten the immigration law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though President Fox has only been in the United States two days, today the INS said we have no way to find him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As many as 26.5 million veterans reported risk recently for identity theft after someone stole a computer disk containing the names, birthdates and Social Security numbers. See, here's my question, why aren't these files put somewhere where no one can find them? You know what I'm saying? Like the same place we put President Bush's National Guard record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Louisiana Congressman William Jefferson was caught on tape taking $100,000 bribe and then the FBI found $90,000 in cash in his freezer. Jefferson said he didn't do anything wrong, he said he just fell in with the wrong crowd. You know, other congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the FBI searched Ted Kennedy's freezer, found 90,000 frozen daiquiris.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Hillary Clinton called for Americans to save gas by returning to the 55 mile an hour speed limit. ... You know, I'm not going to believe she's serious about saving gas until I see her and Bill actually drive somewhere together in the same car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Trade Commission said today they did not find any sign, no signs, that the oil industry illegally manipulated gas prices. They also found no signs of steroid use in baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey has written a book where he said he used to cruise highway rest stops looking to have anonymous sex with gay truckers. Now, here's my question. At what point do you stop having anonymous sex at truck stops and say to yourself, 'You, know, I'm tired of this, I'd rather be governor?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McGreevey said he came out of the closet when he realized where this sort of lifestyle would lead -- marriage to Liza Minnelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has a brand new movie out and it paints a very bleak picture about global warming, apparently Ted Williams head is nearly defrosted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Mexico has arrived in the United States thanks to some nifty fence climbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He offered to take President Bush's job for $3 an hour, cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey has &quot;a new memoir, a gay people memoir that tells everything about his life as the gay governor of New Jersey. I believe it's called the Versace Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden, no getting around it, he's creepy and he sent over one of his videotapes. Chilling, chilling message. On the video tapes he boasts that we will never find him or Jimmy Hoffa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think Osama has gone around the bend. I think he is nuts. I think he is loopy. I think he is dopey. On the video tape, he attempts to hold his breath for nine minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &quot;told Bush that he intends to defend Israel's borders. Yeah, when he heard this, Bush said, 'You mean you have trouble with Mexicans, too?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush flew from Washington to New York. And instead of flying Air Force One, she took the Delta shuttle. The First Lady said she did this because, unlike Air Force One, commercial airlines are cheaper, they waste less gas, and she doesn't get stuck sitting next to a dumb guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a bright side to this for Ken Lay. You know, throughout the years, he's been a huge campaign contributor to the Republican Party. So now he'll be meet with those same people when he goes to prison. There'll be a reunion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald suggested that Dick Cheney could be called to testify in the perjury case of his former chief of staff, Scooter Libby.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the front page of the New York Times was a big story about the state of Hillary Clinton's marriage to Bill Clinton. Front page, New York Times.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former CEO, Ken Lay of Enron, you know the big Enron scandal, billions and billions of dollars defrauded, just a horrible story, he's going away.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what has become standard procedure in these kind of situations, police conducted a room by room search of the Capitol building. Just what Congressmen want to hear this week -- a knock as they were flushing bribe money down the toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, there was no gunfire. They now think it was just an elevator repairman using a pneumatic tool in the elevator. Well, you can see how these mistakes can be made. See, people in Washington are not used to the sound of actual work being done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was also Election Day in California, or, as we call it in Los Angeles, 'Tuesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election day in California is the start of the process where we elect the next leader of the Mexican people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US fighter jets intercepted a small plane that had breached restricted airspace around Washington. Did you hear about that? Apparently, the White House said not to shoot it down unless they had evidence that it contained two gay guys who wanted to get married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush calling for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage. He says he wants to put both al Qaeda and Ikea out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some were surprised that President Bush would back a gay marriage amendment, when it clearly doesn't have the votes to pass. But are you surprised by that? I mean, since when has a lack of votes held back President Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though President Bush is pressing for this gay marriage amendment, Vice President Dick Cheney says he doesn't think the Federal Government should be involved. Yeah. Cheney said the government shouldn't prevent men who are obviously in love with each other from having a relationship. For example, let's say the head of an oil company wants to get in bed with the leader of the Republican Party. They should be allowed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, the Secret Service arrested a guy for trying to jump the fence at the White House. Again! Think about this. They want to build a fence along the Mexican border? We can't even build a fence around the White House to keep people from jumping over!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Patrick Kennedy was released from rehab this week. In fact, they took precautions in Washington. They placed concrete barriers in front of the concrete barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Kennedy was not cured, the doctors made him leave. They said, 'Cure a Kennedy? Hey, we're doctors, not miracle workers!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After coming out of rehab, Congressman Patrick Kennedy said he wants to be treated 'just like a black man, if and when he gets charged for crashing his car into Capitol Hill.' That's what he said. He wants to be treated the same as a black man, yeah. He said that, six cops jumped him, beat the hell out of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'I want to be treated like a black guy,' and then every black guy said, 'Hey, forget that, how about treating us like a rich white guy?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Life and Style Weekly,' Britney Spears' marriage to Kevin has basically turned into a business deal. That's what they said. They said he pretends to be a good husband, and not embarrass her in public, and then he can go out on weekends and do whatever he wants. I'm sorry, that's Bill and Hillary's deal. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here in New York, city gun violence in New York city is up 12%. I knew we could turn this thing around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, quite a lot of gun play now in New York City, but I don't mind. It's a good workout dodging sporadic sniper fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big World Cup tournament kicks off in Germany and they start with a big parade. The giant parade of nations that hate America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, I guess it was a big scare down there in Washington DC, a small plane violated White House air space. And the incident was very upsetting to the President. He was really concerned because he's in the White House at the time and a plane...and here's the problem. He thought it was coming to take him on vacation so he was really upset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But thank God, the resolution to the thing had a happy outcome because at the last minute Dick Cheney picked it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Secret Service caught a man trying to climb over the White House fence. ... Yeah, when they caught the man, the Secret Service said, 'Not so fast. You have three more years, Mr. President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush gave his speech about illegal immigration. Yeah. In his speech, the President told the people of New Mexico, 'We'll never let you into our country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate is considering a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. That's right. Yeah. The amendment is expected to fall a few votes short because Senators Orrin Hatch and Trent Lott are antiquing in Vermont.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Congressman Patrick Kennedy left rehab and returned to Rhode Island. He left rehab and returned to Rhode Island. Unfortunately on his way back, he hit Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, 6/6/06, the devil did not show up yesterday, how about that. Unless, of course, you're a Democrat watching Ann Coulter on the Today show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was election day in California. A record-low turnout, 28%. See, that's what happens when the candidates are named Phil Angelides and Steve Westly, instead of Taylor Hicks and Katharine McPhee.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has rejected the gay marriage ban. If you think about it, you really want Congress defining marriage? That's like asking Charlie Sheen to define monogamy, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican leaders say that after illegal immigration and gay marriage, the next issue President Bush will tackle, flag burning. Flag burning. So, if you're an illegal immigrant who's crossing our border to burn the flag at your gay wedding, we got your number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney gave the commencement speech at his old high school in Casper, Wyoming, last weekend. He told graduating seniors to aim high, because if they didn't, they might shoot somebody in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Center for Public Integrity, in the last five years, Congress got $50 million worth of free trips. $50 million. Isn't that unbelievable? That's over 23,000 free trips. Paid for by somebody else. Yeah. That beats the old record set by Kevin Federline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the current record charts, Dixie Chicks now have the number one album in the country. More bad news for President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big vote in the Senate yesterday. They voted down the gay marriage ban. ... It was a very close vote, 43 voted yea, 44 voted nay, and three voted fabulous.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Vatican says that gay marriage actually is threatening family, threatening families. Really? More than priests?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Coulter &quot;goes around yakking, and she's got herself in a lot of trouble. She made some crazy statements about 9/11. And coincidentally -- and you wouldn't believe this, but coincidentally, Al Gore has now produced a new documentary all about Ann Coulter. It's crazy. Yeah. I believe it's called 'An Inconvenient Bitch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's what we know about Ann Coulter. She's blond, and she's single, and, well, well, maybe somebody will set her up with OJ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Yankees outfielder Melky Cabrera made a spectacular catch...against the left field fence to defeat the Red Sox. And he went up and over. It was incredible. Experts say it's the first time all year a Hispanic man's been cheered for leaping over a fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush went to Nebraska and gave a big speech about immigration. Yeah. Of course, to people in Nebraska, 'immigration' means 'moving to Iowa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, 88-year-old Senator Robert Byrd will become the longest-serving US senator in American history. Yeah, 88. That's crazy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, as you probably know, yesterday US forces killed terrorist al Zarqawi in an air strike. We didn't get the devil on 06/06/06, but we only missed it by one day. That's not bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was hit by two 500-pound bombs. Now, al Zarqawi's name is now Ow, Ow, Ow Zarqawi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what his last words were? Holy Shiite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea of how dangerous things are in Iraq, do you know where Zarqawi was when he was killed? In a safe house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Zarqawi knew what his fate was going to be. Like, today they just released his autobiography. Coincidentally, it's called, 'I'm in a million little pieces.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Discussing the incident today, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, 'Al Zarqawi was mean, vicious and hateful.' So, you know what that means? Ann Coulter could be next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Federal Air Marshal has been suspended from his job after appearing on the TV show 20/20 to complain that the government isn't doing enough job of protecting the identities of Air Marshals. He went on TV to complain that the government was not keeping his identity a secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot&quot; in California, &quot;Dick Cheney went to see al gore's movie, just for the air conditioning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, gay couples were standing next to President Bush, just to get the cold shoulder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush gave a big speech on immigration in Nebraska. And really, what better place to talk about border problems than Nebraska?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore on the show tonight, ladies and gentlemen. This just shows you how quickly things can change. I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger spends his days talking about his political agenda. Al Gore is out promoting his new movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know Al Gore was voted our second most popular guest ever? Actually he finished first, but the Supreme Court, they overturned...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people say Al Gore was the best vice president the country ever had. Now, not to take anything away from Al, but look at the competition. Okay? He replaced a guy who couldn't spell potato. And he was followed by a guy who shot someone in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's movie about global warming broke into the top ten this past weekend. And President Bush was not impressed. He said, 'My movie about me, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' did better than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he's not going to see the film. He's not going to go see it. He said he did go see Ice Age II: The Meltdown, so he has all of the facts about global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's movie, 'An Inconvenient Truth,' it made about $2 million this past weekend. Whereas 'X-Men' made about $150 million. That just goes to show you, we're more interested in fake people trying to save the fake earth, than real people trying to save the real earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, pretty sobering film. I saw it. The critics were calling it a wake-up call. Which is amazing. Whoever thought Al Gore would be giving people a wake-up call?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He makes some interesting points in the film. He says global warming is so bad, they have actually detected a thaw between Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also said if global warming continues tropical countries to the south will become too hot to live in and their desperate citizens will flee north. Which means millions of Mexicans could sneak into the United States. Oh, like that would ever happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been thinking about this. Do you think it is too soon to hit on Mrs. Zarqawi?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard go this, of course, Abu Musab al Zarqawi is dead. Nice shot, Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Abu Musab al Zarqawi was the world's most unhinged lunatic. He is now dead so, that moves Ann Coulter up to first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that the US military dropped a bomb that killed Iraq's number one terrorist, Abu Musab al Zarqawi. They got rid of Abu Musab al Zarqawi. Yeah. Afterwards, President Bush said, 'Oh, great, and I just learned how to pronounce his name.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got al Zarqawi while he was hiding in his safe house. Yeah. As a result, it's been renamed the 'Not-so-safe house.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, remember how President Bush promised to create jobs? You all remember that? Today they announced the latest job opening he created -- head of al Qaeda in Iraq. There is an opening.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the question I would ask now is, 'Who will be the next al Qaeda leader?' Which sounds like a bad reality show on al Jazeera television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how they pick the al Qaeda leaders? Do you know how it's done? Anybody know? This is fascinating. The job will go to the next guy with the most 'Z's' and 'Q's' in his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the last thing that went through Zarqawi's mind was? A 500-pound bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now his supporters in the Middle East are claiming there is more than one al Zarqawi, which is okay. We have more than one 500-pound bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces said they learned where Zarqawi was staying by tracking his spiritual advisor. He has a spiritual advisor. What a great job that guy was doing. I think the last spiritual advice he gave him was, 'start praying and kiss your ass good-bye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And discussing the incident, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld described him as 'dark, sadistic and medieval.' To which Dick Cheney said, 'you make that sound like a bad thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton furious at writer Ann Coulter for attacking the 9/11 widows. Man, this is the maddest Hillary's ever been at any woman not currently sleeping with her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I got to side with Hillary on this one. I'm on her side. I liked Ann Coulter better when she was fighting Sigourney Weaver in those 'Alien' movies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former House leader Tom DeLay officially left Congress this week. He stepped down. He said he's leaving Congress with no regrets, no shame, and no ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a recent study, my home state, our home state of Massachusetts has some of the worst drivers in the nation. But in fairness to Massachusetts, we do have the Kennedys. That throws the curve way off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush said that any attempt -- any attempt to deport 11 million illegal aliens 'ain't gonna work.' That's what he said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all heard, Alberto was in the Gulf of Mexico, moving north towards Florida. Not the hurricane. A guy on a raft from Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, there's a big storm named Alberto heading toward Florida, and CNN said that Florida residents should have a survival plan to take care of themselves in case, you know, FEMA shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the name of the hurricane, Alberto. See, I tell you something, even these hurricanes are getting smarter. They know a Hispanic hurricane has a better chance of getting into the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a weather report over al Zarqawi's safe house in Iraq. It's partly Sunni with widely scattered Shiites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine, two 500-pound bombs landed on your home. Boy, that would pretty much throw your feng shui out of alignment, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally nice to hear about two huge bombs that NBC was not responsible for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess over the weekend, they conducted an autopsy on this al Zarqawi guy. This is my question. Is that really necessary? I mean, all the people going, 'Gee, I wonder what he died from. He seemed so healthy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, analysts are all over this thing. They're now saying the real cause of Zarqawi's downfall, signing up on MySpace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that illegal immigrants who come to America should learn English. He said, 'Hey, if I was moving to Canada, I would learn Canadian.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He also said, 'From now on, all lawns will be mowed in English.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers in Oakland, California, found that drinking coffee can counteract the effects of alcohol on the liver. And today, Congressman Patrick Kennedy crashed his car into a Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In World Cup Soccer, Mexico beat Iran, 3-1. So it's a victory for the LA home team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mexicans went through Iran's defense like it was our border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the biggest victory for the Mexican people, I guess, since the guest worker program.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Zarqawi, they knocked him out over the weekend. And al Qaeda has chosen a new leader in Iraq. His name is Abu Hamza al-Muhajir. The new al Qaeda leader in Iraq. Big step for this guy because his last job he was in charge of corporate gifting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't waste any time, Zarqawi was killed and they named this Abu al-Muhajir, or as the Special Forces refer to him, next.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Secrets Found In Al Zarqawi's Safe House: 10. He occasionally liked to dress up in a frilly pink burqa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many had an al Zarqawi weekend this weekend? You know what that is? You know what an al Zarqawi weekend is? You ever had that? That's where you get bombed, can't find your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news coming out about the death of al Zarqawi. They say he died of complication of his lungs. That's what they said. They said he was smoking when they found him. Not cigarettes. He was actually smoking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said when investigators were going through the rubble, they found women's lingerie, a leopard teddy. That's what it said. So apparently al Zarqawi was not only a member of al Qaeda, he was a member of al Kinky as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made a surprise visit to Iraq today. It lasted five hours. Five hours -- that's longer than he stayed at any of the National Guard meetings. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the White House planned the whole trip in total secrecy. The prime minister of Iraq was not told. The press was not told. Even President Bush was not told. In fact, when he got off the plane in Baghdad he said, 'Whoo, boy, Arizona's hot. Phoenix is unbelievable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security very, very tight. Even had Dick Cheney riding shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went to Iraq to boost the new government. That shows you how rough the situation is in Iraq, when a guy with a 30% approval rating stops by to give you a boost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news for the White House. Today Federal prosecutors told Karl Rove he will not be charged, not be indicted in the CIA leak case. This is the best news for the White House since oil hit $70 a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the money from the oil in Iraq should be used for the benefit of the people of Iraq. Hey, I'm all for that, but how come the money from the oil in America can't be used for the benefit of the people of America? Why is it going to the oil company executives?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week the Senate voted to make English the official language of the United States. I don't know, have they thought this through? You know what that means? Bob Dylan may have to leave the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, Robert Byrd became the longest-serving senator in US history. He's been a Senator for 48 years. And Minority Leader Harry Reid called him a giant, and Anna Nicole Smith called him 'The Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's officially hurricane season again, or as FEMA calls it, 'Hiatus, vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Major League Baseball, they have suspended pitcher Jason Grimsley. What is he, the Diamondbacks? Arizona? For 50 games for using human growth hormones. 50 games, suspended. Yeah. But Grimsley said he was not deterred. He said he's going to come back bigger and stronger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so warm and beautiful here in New York City today, Al Gore said to hell with the glaciers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk Mayor Bloomberg may run for president. I thought there was a height requirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's interesting news from the Pentagon, ladies and gentlemen, according to autopsy results, al Zarqawi, cause of death: Choked on a ham sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Iraqi terror mastermind, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is dead. Yeah. Warm up the virgins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, his successor, Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, and if everything happens to that guy, Russell Crowe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq's prime minister has implemented -- he's got some things going on there in Iraq. He has a curfew, has tried a curfew now. There's a ban on personal weapons. And if that works, President Bush said he's going to try the same things on Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news of the day is President Bush made his second surprise visit to Baghdad. Flew in and out, a surprise, nobody knew he was coming. He sneaked in and out of Baghdad and it went so well, that they now have a secret plan to sneak a guy in and out of Condoleezza Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush made a surprise visit to Baghdad. Big story. Apparently, the President was confused by all the destruction because the first thing he said was, 'Hello, Detroit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, the US eliminated Iraq's number one terrorist, Abu Musab al Zarqawi. This week, al Qaeda announced his successor, Abu Hamza al Muhajir. Yeah. When asked why they chose him, an al Qaeda spokesperson said, 'We have a lot of leftover stationary that says 'From the desk of Abu.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Texas has put webcams -- webcams on the Mexican border so people can sit at their home computers and look for illegal aliens trying to cross into the US. Yeah, the Website is free, but it costs $5 if you want the illegal aliens to talk dirty to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Al Gore's wife Tipper said she would -- she would support her husband if he decided to run for president again. Yeah. And she said, 'But there's no way I'm sitting through his movie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda announced they've already named al Zarqawi's replacement. His name is Abu Hamza al Muhajer. The name 'Muhajer' in Arabic means 'immigrant.' And today out of force of habit, California gave him a driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muhajer said today he vowed 'to follow in the slain leader's path, but I'm not gonna be moving into his house anytime soon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats refuse to give President Bush any credit for killing al Zarqawi. Like today, Al Gore blamed it on global warming. He said a meteorite hit the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then John Kerry said of the two 500-pound bombs that hit the safe house, he voted for the first bomb, not the second.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More details coming about how President Bush planned his secret trip to Iraq yesterday. ... After dinner Bush excused himself by saying, 'I'm going up to read.' Is that the most believable excuse? Really, 'I'm going up to read.' Isn't that like Bill Clinton going, 'Excuse me, guys, I got to spend some time with Hillary. I'll be back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush sneaked into Iraq without any formal paperwork, which I guess technically made him an undocumented leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To make sure nobody paid any attention to Air Force One, on the side of the plane they painted, 'Kevin Federline World Tour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing President Bush asked the new Prime Minister of Iraq was, 'You guys aren't allowing any of them gay marriages, are you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sad part of President Bush's trip, he's so unpopular, he had to sneak back into this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prosecutors announced yesterday that Karl Rove will not be charged with any crimes in the investigation of that leak of the CIA agent Valerie Plame. The White House was pretty relieved. In fact, President Bush told Dick Cheney, 'You can cancel that hunting trip with Karl rove.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressional investigators say that FEMA was conned out of $1.4 billion in bogus claims including people paying for season football tickets, tropical vacations, golf outings. No, I'm sorry. That was Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over $1 billion of FEMA money went to things like strip clubs, hookers, pornography, 'Girls Gone Wild' videos, liquor, and $200 bottles of champagne at hooters. And the rest of the money? It was just wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representative Patrick Kennedy has agreed to plead guilty to driving under the influence of prescription drugs. He's gonna cop to a DUI, which not much you can do, really. They had plenty of concrete evidence. Like the fact that his car was wrapped around concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illegal border crossings along the US-Mexican border have dropped 23% in the first ten days of June. ... No, they think it's 'cause of the presence of National Guard troops or maybe the fact that everybody from Mexico is already here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a big speech yesterday , Bill Clinton said it is now recognized that he and Al Gore were right about global warming. You get the feeling right now Al Gore's going, 'Hey, what do you mean we?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Clinton talking about it at all? The only thing Clinton ever was thought was hot back in the '90s was Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest deal on the Hurricane Katrina FEMA situation. Apparently now, FEMA, the relief fund, $1.2 billion were spent on things like a divorce, a divorce a sex change -- does this make you angry? Are you angry? Are you angry because you had to pay for your own divorces and your own sex change?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; $1.4 billion in hurricane aid was spent on booze, was spent on vacations, spent on hookers...well, apparently, some of the folks down there got blown more than once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard about al Qaeda's new leader in Iraq, Abu Hamza al-Muhajer? Earlier today he was on Iraq's big morning show, 'Live with Mohamed and Kelly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's Iraq trip was so top secret that before he left, he lied to his Cabinet members, told them he was going to bed early so he could read. Yeah, when the Secret Service heard this, they said, 'We've got to come up with a better story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After visiting Baghdad for five hours, five hours yesterday, President Bush told reporters that he is 'upbeat about Iraq.' Yeah. Right, Bush's exact were, 'Next time, I'm going to stay for six hours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, $1.4 billion of FEMA money for Hurricane Katrina victims was used to buy alcohol, vacations and pornography. Even worse, some of it was wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! Yeah! Oh, man. Thank you very much. Thank you. You sound like you've been out partying with those FEMA credit cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressional investigators now say FEMA was conned out of over $1.4 billion in bogus claims. And imagine how much worse it would have been if FEMA had gotten there on time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One man in New Orleans used his card for a sex change operation. And ironically, his name is now Katrina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress outraged by the bogus claims. Congress said if people want to break the law and steal taxpayer money, hey, get elected to Congress like everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Congress, the other day, very quietly -- nobody knows this, they don't report these things -- they voted themselves a $3,300 pay raise. Well, why not? Job well done. Huh, fellas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they -- a lot of added expense this year -- legal fees, criminal defense lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush returned safely from the surprise trip to Iraq. A lot of people criticized President Bush saying he was only in Iraq for five hours. Hey. Still, five hours longer than the French were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today in Iraq, the new prime minister instituted a ban on guns. Hey, good luck with that, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made another shocking surprise visit today that stunned everyone. He went to a bookstore. That's never happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the difference between al Zarqawi and Patrick Kennedy? Patrick Kennedy will get bombed again. That's about the only difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has not been a good day for Mrs. al Zarqawi. Yeah, they had the reading of the will today. She got the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq's national security adviser says that a treasure chest of information including documents, computer records and such were confiscated from Zarqawi's house after the bombing, which is good news. See, I want to know what brand of computer he had. Two 500-pound bombs dropped on his house -- his computer is still working. I knock a drink over my keyboard, I'm talking to Apu in India for an hour and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's number one speech writer, a man named Michael Gerson, resigned yesterday after seven years writing speeches for the President. It's already having an effect on Mr. Bush. Like, after turning in his resignation, Mr. Bush wished him the goodest of luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in the Senate have announced they are moving on from gay marriage -- that's over -- to a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. They want to ban flag burning, this so we can join the only other three countries in the world that ban flag burnings -- China, Cuba, and Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news from President Bush at a press conference yesterday. He was upbeat. He was cheerful. He was optimistic, that's right, he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week president Bush quietly sneaked into Iraq. Here is an idea. Why don't we quietly sneak out of Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comparatively, President Bush quietly sneaked it into Baghdad, nobody knew about it. ... Bill Clinton, on the other hand, sneaks into an intern, everybody knows about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush's chief speech writer announced he's leaving the White House. His exact words were, 'Me go now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has apologized today for scolding a member of the White House press corps for wearing sunglasses, 'cause he found out the reporter was legally blind. He yelled at the guy, the guy's legally blind, yeah. Bush also apologized for telling physicist Stephen Hawking to 'get off your lazy ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US Immigration service busy. You hear this? They deported 2,000 illegal immigrants this week in a program they're calling 'Operation Return to Sender,' or as the program is also known, 'Operation We're Taking Away Your Gardner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore getting more vocal lately. You heard his latest? He spoke out today about the US air strike.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About a week ago, they bombed al-Zarqawi, and now they're sifting through the remains of the house where he was bombed and they're finding unbelievable things. Earlier today, for example, they uncovered the body of Jimmy Hoffa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out a lot of people used their FEMA disaster money for things like liquor, pornography and prostitutes. But then again, people cope with tragedy in different ways. You know, who are we to judge?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're calling it one of the worst collapses in US Open history. On the last hole, Phil Mickelson shot into the hospitality tent. The next shot he hit a tree.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out al Qaeda had a plot to put poison gas in the New York City subway system, then abandoned the idea at the last minute. Well, sure, once it mixed with the toxic fumes and vile odors already in the subway, who would have noticed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is creating a marine sanctuary in the Pacific Ocean, off the northwest islands of Hawaii. You know what that means -- no oil there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea wants the United States to know they're about to test a long-range missile that they say may eventually have the capability of reaching the United States.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about a man and a woman who are having a relationship, but they never actually meet or see each other. They just communicate by leaving notes. Or as the Clintons call that, a marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton &quot;has made, making these speeches he has made $7.5 million, $7.5 million. It's amazing, isn't it. And of course it was all reported. It's not like the old days when he did business under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>

See, I think that's because of global warming too. I think Al feels he has to eat all the ice cream before it melts, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you know, the United States is out of World Cup soccer. ... You know, the US loses this thing every four years. It's like the Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at Brigham Young University, a teacher there was fired for questioning the Mormon church's stand on gay marriage. As you know, in Utah they believe a marriage is between a man and a woman and a woman and a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Al Gore's movie, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth,&quot; he &quot;can explain and statistically verify that, yes, in fact, the ambient atmosphere of the earth is increasing. ... How many like me just couldn't care less?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see these huge rainstorms all the way from Minnesota to New York? Or as Al Gore is calling it, global leaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heavy rains caused so much flooding in Washington, DC today, they had to close down the National Archives. You know, where they keep the Constitution. They had to close it down. You know, luckily the Bush Administration is not using the Constitution anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also had flooding at the Internal Revenue Service and had to close that down. They said some records may have been lost. Good!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine trying to tell the IRS you lost your records in a rainstorm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The flooding was so bad in Washington, New Orleans' Mayor Ray Nagin called the President and said, 'You're on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 140-year-old tree on the White House grounds fell over. Luckily, Daryl Hannah, who was in the tree at the time, escaped injury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minute the tree fell over, President Bush wasted no time in blaming it on the 'New York Times.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush criticized the New York Times for revealing a government program to spy on people's bank accounts. And President Bush defended it. Bush said, 'If you want to figure out what bad people are doing, follow the money.' And you know, he was right. That's how we got Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continues to be those seven men arrested in Miami for terrorist activities. The FBI said the men thought they were dealing with a member of al Qaeda. Turns out it was actually an undercover police officer instead. Yeah. So let that be a lesson to everybody out there. Whenever you're approached by someone claiming to be al Qaeda, always ask for an ID.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said these men wore turbans and would walk around Miami with their faces covered. Well, that's a good way to avoid arousing suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Census Bureau revealed today that Las Vegas is about to pass Washington, DC in population. Of course, there's a big difference between Vegas and Washington. Of course, in Vegas people gamble with their own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Knicks coach Larry Brown has been fired. Yeah, Larry knew he was in trouble when team president Isiah Thomas took him aside and said, 'Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Warren Buffett announced he's giving away his multibillion-dollar fortune to charity rather than leaving it to his kids. That's what he said. ... He said he doesn't believe that somebody's son should inherit his father's position in society. And today, President Bush had him put under surveillance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the murder rate in New York city is up 9%. But think where it would be without Superman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The murder rate is up 9%, but the good news is more apartment vacancies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is mad at the New York Times because they broke the story that the White House is secretly tracking our banking transactions. You know about this? They're looking out for when people suddenly withdraw large amounts of cash. You know, either terrorists or people who need to fill up their SUV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is so angry at the New York Times he said today he's not even going to pretend to read it anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And terrible rains in Washington, DC, this week. In fact, Karl Rove's office was leaking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It rained so hard today President Bush ducked into to take shelter in a theater showing Al Gore's movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major flooding struck all parts of the Federal Government. You know the FEMA office had over three feet of water in it. And here's the sad part. They still don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, a 140-year-old tree fell on the White House lawn because of the storm. Well, actually, a combination of factors that brought the tree down. The weather, the age of the tree, and of course Patrick Kennedy's car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's Tuesday, or as Rush Limbaugh calls it, 'Hump Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was my favorite story. Rush 'Limpbaugh' was detained -- for more than three hours at the Palm Beach Airport after officials found a bottle of Viagra in his possession with someone else's name on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How ironic is that? The one Republican with a plan to get cheap prescription drugs and they try to arrest him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even he was joking about it today. But Rush Limbaugh's friends said that they are worried about him. Worried about him? How about the poor woman underneath him? Anybody thought about her? Come to think of it, anybody seen Ann Coulter in the last couple of days?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is it with Republicans and Viagra? First Bob Dole. He was doing the ads for Viagra. Now you've got Rush Limbaugh. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, but the man was always there to answer the call, ladies and gentlemen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got so busy this afternoon I skipped lunch, or as Saddam Hussein calls it, a hunger strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Saddam Hussein went on a hunger strike and ended it after one meal. Missed one meal and ended his hunger strike. I guess you know how hard it is to stay away from Iraqi prison food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just a week to go until the presidential election in Mexico. Once the results are in, the people of Los Angeles will have a new leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now says that the climate change is a serious problem. President Bush said this. Climate change is a serious problem especially when he's trying to plan a three-month vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said climate change is a serious problem. Then he said, 'sounds like a job for Superman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Superman returns. It's a two-hour film. ... I don't want to say it's dull but all it is for two hours Superman talks about global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A powerful storm in Washington DC knocked over a 100-year-old elm tree on the White House lawn. Yeah, President Bush was not hurt, because he was playing in a different tree at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine's cover story this week is on President Teddy Roosevelt, the man who said, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick.' I'm sorry, that's Rush Limbaugh.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always get those two confused, you know, because Teddy Roosevelt is on Mount Rushmore. Rush wanted to mount more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, Rush Limbaugh was detained for three hours at the Palm Beach airport for having a bottle of Viagra that was not prescribed to him. His lawyer said Limbaugh's doctor prescribed the Viagra for himself and then gave the pills to Limbaugh so no one would find out that Rush was doing Viagra. Well, that plan worked out well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news coming out about those seven men in Miami that the FBI arrested. They said they were planning to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago. Seems they pledged their allegiance to al Qaeda. And they were after virgins in the afterlife because they couldn't find any in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Military commanders in Iraq say the day is fast approaching when we will start withdrawing our troops. I believe that day is called 'Election Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech in Washington, DC, Delaware Senator Joe Biden said although he wants to be president -- you all know Joe Biden. He said he wants to be president, but he'd rather be at home making love to his wife. That's what he said. Ironically, Bill Clinton said the same thing. He said he'd rather be home making love to Joe Biden's wife, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Census Bureau announced today that this October, the United States will have its 300 millionth person. ... Based on the computer projection, they said there's a 10% chance he will arrive by cesarean birth, but a 90% chance he will arrive in the trunk of a Chevy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is criticizing the New York Times for revealing how we track terrorists' money. Yeah, he's also criticized the Times for not having a funny pages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That program to track terrorists' money was working. That's the sad thing. As a matter of fact, last month, we switched Osama bin Laden to a lower-interest account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hate to see something like this happen, but Rush Limbaugh is flying someplace and he lands and they're going through his luggage, and they found he had illegal Viagra. So chalk up another one for Homeland Security, ladies and gentlemen. Yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush urged the Senate to give him line-item veto power. He wants line-veto power. Yeah. Later, the President said that line-item veto power would be nice but what he really wants is X-ray vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Washington, DC, received a foot of rain and part of the IRS building was flooded. The bad news, part of the IRS building was not flooded.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Senator Hillary Clinton says she wants to block a plan to hold an extra caucus before the New Hampshire primary. Yeah, when he heard this, Bill Clinton said, 'I've always said that Hillary's a caucus blocker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants a tax on pimps and prostitutes. And then jail them if they don't pay it. Well, good to see Congress finally policing itself, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House has passed a bill to fund President Bush's plan to send a man to Mars. The man he's sending to Mars, the editor of the New York Times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is furious with the New York Times for publishing a secret CIA Treasury program that tracks the financial records of terrorist suspects.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Star Jones told the Daily News today that she was let go&quot; from the TV show The View &quot;because her approval ratings had gone down. And President Bush said, 'They can fire you for that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself, things are bad over there. Earlier today, Governor George Pataki toured the site of 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend, Rush Limbaugh was arrested at an airport because he had illegal Viagra. So apparently Dick Cheney is not the only Republican who is locked and loaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled that President Bush over stepped his authority by ordering military trials for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush took Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi...took him to Graceland. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To his credit, President Bush knew all the protocol when meeting a Japanese Prime Minister. You know, he's had a lot of practice bowing to the oil company executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate...held hearings on President Bush's use of signing statements. You know what those are, signing statements? That's a proclamation which lets the president sign a bill, he can sign a law, and then limit what part of that law actually applies to him. Of course, the Democrats are acting like this is something new. This is not new. Same thing Bill Clinton used when he signed his marriage license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has warned North Korea against test firing its new missile. President Bush said, 'Put your missile away, and stop threatening other people with it.' I'm sorry, that's what he said to Rush Limbaugh. You know, I'm confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new Osama bin Laden tape has been released. Very disturbing. And it's clear this tape was made fairly recently. Do we have that? Can we play the translation?&quot; Bin Laden, via translator: &quot;I come to you today with unanswered questions. When will the United States leave the Middle East? And what the heck was Star Jones thinking? After all Barbara Walters has done for her, quitting on the air without telling her is unforgivable!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Superman was really the first illegal alien we couldn't catch. Did you know that? I mean, he wasn't born here.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities in New York City have foiled a plot by terrorists to blow up the Holland Tunnel. There was one awkward moment when officials informed President Bush the Holland Tunnel was safe and Bush then thanked the Dutch authorities for all their help.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we finally found some weapons of mass destruction. The bad news, they're in North Korea. Boy, that Saddam is sneaky, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Japanese Prime Minister joined the United States in condemning North Korea's missile policy. In fact, the Japanese Prime Minister was really upset when he found out they had missiles that could reach Graceland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said these North Korean missiles had enough range to hit Seattle. Yeah. But residents of Seattle were not worried. In fact, today Bill Gates said Microsoft has enough missiles to destroy North Korea ten times over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico had a problem with their election last week. Very, very close. As I understand returns are still coming in from Van Nuys, Rancho Cucamonga, San Jose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Houston police and Transportation Security officials are finger-pointing over who was to blame for letting a man on a Delta flight. Listen to this. Guy gets on a Delta flight with a nine-volt battery taped to an alarm clock, a laptop, a copy of the Koran and hollowed-out shoes. He gets through security and they let him on the plane. How does this make Rush Limbaugh feel, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for Rush Limbaugh. Looks like he will not be charged with a crime after having that apparently illegal bottle of Viagra with him. But see, I think that's fair. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, what happens in Rush's pants stays in Rush's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, Enron's president, Ken Lay, passed away last week. So, I guess even God lost money on that Enron deal, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the official cause of death was listed as karma.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Volkswagen has unveiled a car that will drive itself. They say it can drive at speeds of up to 150 miles an hour without the driver ever touching the steering wheel or the brakes. That's not new. The Kennedys have been doing that for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just about now Ken Lay should be arriving in hell. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The All-Star game is in Pittsburgh tonight. And last night they had the home run derby. That was pretty exciting. In fact, most of the home runs went further than those North Korean missiles, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japan says they're now considering whether attacking North Korea's missile sites would violate their constitution. Imagine that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today we should be patient with North Korea and use diplomacy and not rush into any kind of military action. You know what that means. No oil over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Pete Hoekstra has charged the Bush Administration with keeping programs secret from Congress. Let me tell you something. If President Bush really wants to keep his programs a secret, talk to NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told People magazine this week that he's working on a solution for global warming. He said it will be ready in less than six months. Yeah. It's called winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Early last week the leftist candidate was declared the winner in Mexico in their presidential election. Then after a recount, the conservative candidate was named president. Apparently they had some problem with the ballots. They have what they call 'hanging Juans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The losing candidate, the liberal, is asking for a ballot recount of all 41 million votes. Wants all 41 million votes recounted. But conservatives say there aren't enough people to do the work. I've got an idea. Why don't we send them some of our temporary guest workers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week indicted Enron crook Ken Lay died of a heart attack. They announced they're going to cremate him. Where he's going, why bother?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot today here in New York City, isn't it? It was so hot up in Chappaqua, Bill Clinton got in bed with Hillary just for the chill.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any on-line gamblers here? Congress is looking into shutting that down. There's going to be a massive congressional investigation of on-line gambling. They're going to shut it down. That's right. When they get done with that, they're going to look into this North Korea thing. But right now they're going after the on-line gambling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is an historic day. Do you have any idea what today is? On this day in 1804 Vice President Aaron Burr shot Alexander Hamilton. A vice president shooting a guy. Luckily something like that couldn't happen today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the shuttle astronauts did a space walk and fixed a cable that powers the movable platform that carries the space station's robotic arm. They have a robotic arm. In fact, while they were up there, they fixed the arm. So it's now giving the finger to North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush said we should be patient with North Korea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Pete Hoekstra has charged the Bush Administration with keeping programs secret from congress. Apparently, nobody in Congress reads the New York Times, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Services were held today for Ken Lay, convicted thief and crook Ken Lay. They folded his arms across his chest and sewed his sleeves together so he couldn't put his hands in anybody's pockets when they walked by.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Fox News crew was shot out -- shot -- shot -- shot at -- on live TV. They were shot at on live TV after they revealed detailed information about Israeli troop movements. Now, we're not 100% sure who did the shooting, but here's the interesting part. The shooting stopped as soon as they found out Geraldo was not there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Russia, President Bush met with 15 pro-democracy activists who asked him to help them stop the Russian government from spying on their citizens and listening in on their phone calls.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, the Vatican weighed in on the crisis. The Vatican came out and condemned Israel's attacks on Lebanon. Yeah. Yeah, which is great, 'cause all day yesterday, the Jews and Muslims were asking, 'What do the Catholics think?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Bush was greeting crowds in Germany today, he grabbed a baby from its mother and the baby burst into tears. Yeah, President Bush says he doesn't care how much the baby cries, he's keeping the blankie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Russia announced that it is willing to store nuclear waste from other countries. They're willing to do it, yeah. A spokesperson for Russia said, 'Our goal is to be the New Jersey of Europe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's movie on global warming is correct, as you know, the ice caps are shrinking -- you all know about that. The glaciers are shrinking. The only thing not shrinking, Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heat, it puts people in a bad mood. In fact, coming to work today, people were swearing like President Bush over an open mic. It's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. President Bush being recorded using a four-letter word at the G-8 summit in Russia. Four-letter word. Yeah, yeah. At first everyone thought he just mispronounced the word 'Shiite.' But no, that wasn't it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, it's kind of ironic. President Bush listening in on everyone else's phone calls. Now he's the one getting caught for saying something he shouldn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the United States trying to evacuate 5,000 of our citizens from Lebanon, but the Pentagon says it's hard to move people across a border without, you know, moving quickly, without any paperwork. You know what we should do? Ask the Mexican government for help. They move 12 million people across the border with no paperwork.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was in Germany, President Bush praised the German people on their contributions that the country has made. President Bush said, 'If it wasn't for Germany there would be nothing to watch on the History Channel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Valerie Plame, you know who she is.

The head guy at Coors. See, I can't believe he didn't win the Senate race. I mean, he gets busted for drunk driving, he tried to cover it up. He's obviously qualified to be senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have arrested an 80-year-old man and charged him with selling crack. It's so sad to see what's happened to Dan Rather.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what President Bush said at the G8 summit. He was overheard using dirty language at the G-8 summit. Later he was ejected for head butting. Yeah. He's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is in Russia attending the G-8 summit. And he has an agenda. And a lot of people are stunned, he has an agenda?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he wants to talk about the hot spots in the world today. That's on his agenda. He wants to talk about the fighting in the Middle East, makes sense.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More rockets were fired into Israel today. Israel responded by bombing more targets inside Lebanon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, a lot of military experts are wondering how the US can stop Israel from getting bombed. Israel, we can't even stop Pete Coors from getting bombed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were offended by President Bush using a four-letter word at the G-8 summit the other day. Did you hear about this? Were you offended? See, I was more offended by the way he eats a buttered roll in front of company.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House press secretary Tony Snow says that when President Bush told him he was recorded saying a four-letter word, he rolled his eyes and laughed it off. Which is ironic. Bush is now reacting to himself the way everybody else does.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By a vote of 236 to 187, the House failed to pass a ban on gay marriages.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the big G-8 summit was not that successful. Only one good thing came out of the G-8 summit. They issued a desperate plea to Superman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made a number of gaffes at the G-8 summit. One of them, he gave a neck rub to the chancellor of Germany. So you know what that means, he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
