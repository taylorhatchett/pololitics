<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? Earlier today -- did you hear about this? Janet Jackson's right breast came out, saw its shadow, six more weeks of winter. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched the big Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday? Or as they're calling it now, America's Cup, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know who was really mad about that whole incident? President Bush. He was very upset. In fact, today, he accused Janet Jackson of having weapons of mass arousal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it turns out -- and I was shocked to hear this, Janet admitted it was a stunt. They did it on purpose. I thought it was a complete accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FCC Chairman, Michael Powell, you know, they're in charge of television, what goes over the airwaves, he said he gathered with his family to watch the show, but got a classless, crass and deplorable stunt. Or as we call it here at NBC, 'Fear Factor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS said they may bar Janet Jackson from the Grammies. They're going to bar her from the Grammies. Exactly. You know, that's just a case of tit for tat, that's all it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it was quite a Super Bowl show, when you think about it. There was the streaker. We saw the streaker, that guy. Then Janet's breasts were exposed. And Kid Rock wore an American flag as a poncho. I'm surprised John Ashcroft's head didn't explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, CBS said today that's why they put the three Xs in the title. Those weren't Roman numerals, that was the rating of the Super Bowl show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I'm so mad. I lost all my computer files today. Opened this email, mydoom. You know mydoom? I just thought it was another email from the Howard Dean campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday -- that's when Janet shows both breasts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know yet, because we taped a little earlier, we don't know the results yet. It doesn't look good for Dean. In fact, critics are saying it may all be over for Dean but the shouting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry appears to be the frontrunner. You know the name of Kerry's campaign bus? 'The Real Deal Express.' That's the name of his campaign bus. You know the name of Dennis Kucinich's campaign bus? Greyhound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kucinich not doing well. He's not doing well. In fact, today, even people in Florida said they wouldn't vote for Kucinich even by mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush admitted that his pre-war intelligence wasn't what it should have been. We knew that when we elected him. What are you talking about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a classic foot-in-mouth disease. Yesterday on MSNBC, televangelist Pat Robertson, you know, Pat, the conservative broadcaster? Pat Robertson said the reason Democrats are so competitive in national elections is that African-Americans -- and this is his quote - 'Don't cotton to the idea of voting for Republicans.' You know, maybe it's because Republicans like Pat Robertson keep using cotton as a verb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our old friend, California Governor Gray Davis -- you know Gray Davis? He's been out of work for a while. He's got a new job. He's going to guest star on the CBS sitcom 'Yes, Dear' next month. Let me tell you, this guy Gray Davis is very clever. See, I know what he's doing. He plans to become a famous actor, go back into politics, beat Arnold at his own game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what this is, around the country there are seven big primaries going on, seven presidential primary elections. Which means that at any minute, we may have to cut away for a screaming Howard Dean concession speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, part of Janet Jackson popped out and saw its shadow. Six more weeks of winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, is now investigating the Super Bowl half time show. And actually, President Bush has formed a Department of Wardrobe Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush missed the Super Bowl halftime show. He slept right through it. Typical CBS viewer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The official explanation is 'wardrobe malfunction.' She's blaming the whole thing on a wardrobe malfunction. Former President Clinton heard that and said, 'Why didn't I think of that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, seven primaries today. I hope you all went out and voted in each and every one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;True story -- Al Sharpton campaigned in South Carolina, and friends say that Sharpton got angry when he drove past the house and saw a jockey statue on the front lawn. He got mad. Yeah, then the statue moved, and he realized it was Dennis Kucinich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, on the campaign trail, former General Wesley Clark brought on stage a man who saved his life in Vietnam. Yeah. Yeah, the stunt may have backfired on Clark, because the man was John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, California first lady Maria Schriver announced that she has decided to quit her job as an NBC reporter. She's leaving. Yeah, Schriver said she quit her job so she can devote all her time to figuring out what the hell her husband is saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Senator John Kerry, the big winner in yesterday's primary. Won five out of seven, John Kerry. You know, I just hope all these victories don't give John Kerry a big head. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, John Edwards won his home state of South Carolina. It was interesting. He said again last night, he said, 'There are really two Americas.' And he wants to create just one America. And today, Republicans said, 'That's fine with us, as long as there's still a first-class section.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Lieberman has pulled out of the presidential race. Yeah. It's sad. Now, of course, comes the hard part -- telling his supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Howard Dean got under 10% in South Carolina, Missouri, and Oklahoma. So that Al Gore endorsement's really starting to kick in now. Shows you the power of that Al Gore endorsement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Howard Dean was talking about health care again today. Nothing to do with the campaign. I think he realized he was going to have to go back to being a doctor real soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, this past weekend was tough on a lot of candidates. Do you know this? John Edwards got caught trying to bring a penknife through airport security. They nailed him for that. Wesley Clark's motorcade got stopped for speeding in Oklahoma. This is true. And Dennis Kucinich's campaign was cited for loitering. So it was not a good week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has started a campaign on the accomplishments of his Administration. Bin Laden's been forced into hiding. Saddam Hussein is being interrogated. Janet Jackson is under investigation. He's doing it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush also released his new $2.4 trillion Federal budget. $2.4 trillion. It's a two-part budget. It's smoke and mirrors. It's a combination of the two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I think he's in trouble. For the first time since his Presidency, President Bush's approval rating has dropped below 50%. The last time Bush was below 50% was when he got his report card from Yale. That was the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they say Bush's popularity is falling so fast, his new Secret Service code name is Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something frightening. Yesterday in Washington, three of the Senate office buildings were shut down after a white powdery substance tested positive for ricin. You know, at first they thought it was another one of John Kerry's botox deliveries. They didn't realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the ricin was found in the office of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. Police now believe the person who sent it is someone who has a grudge against Senate Republicans. So now they're looking for a gay middle-class couple with no health care. That's who they're looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of this ricin poison scare yesterday, the US Senate postponed all voting. This has a ripple effect on the economy because when politicians can't vote, oil companies, drug companies, tobacco companies, they can't give them money, and that means that bartenders, hookers, they all suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS announced today they will be using a five-minute tape delay when they televise the Grammys next week so they can stop any artist who attempts to flash. This is just a booby trap. That's what they call it. A booby trap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dr. Phil, who's a guest on our show tonight -- Dr. Phil has launched his new project, his teen weight loss challenge. His goal is pretty ambitious. He hopes to do more for young, overweight women than Bill Clinton. That's his goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately after the Super Bowl how many of you saw big Survivor, the Super Bowl battle of the [Survivor all-stars]. It was very exciting the whole gang is back, they got the old guy, they got the naked fat guy. They got the ex-bartender. They have the former Green Beret. Oh, no, wait a minute, those are the Democratic candidates for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what this means exactly, but President Bush's approval rating is down below 50%. Yeah, that's too bad. So now he's going to have to let Saddam go and catch him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course last night was a big Democratic primary, they had like seven primaries, and caucuses all across the United States, and today presidential candidate Howard Dean was at a fish market in Seattle catching fish. And he did so well that next week he starts full-time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of poor results in the primaries last night, Senator Joe Lieberman is dropping out of the presidential race, did you hear that? Yes, yes. Earlier today he broke the news to his supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also bad news for Dennis Kucinich, he finished behind Punxsutawney Phil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're talking about a Federal investigation into that Janet Jackson thing I was telling you about, and she's claimed it's a wardrobe malfunction so, when this punk, this young hooligan leaps on stage and yanked her thing off, it a wardrobe malfunction. So now there's going to be a Federal investigation, as a matter of fact former President Clinton offered to look into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Things Never Before Said by a Presidential Candidate (as read by John Edwards): 10. Vote for me or I'll slash your tires. 9. Forget universal health care - I'm buying every American an XBox. 8. In a crisis, I ask myself, 'What would Tony Danza do?' 7. I'd give you my plan for economic recovery if I wasn't rip-stinkin' drunk. 6. 'If your last name begins with 'M' through 'Z,' sorry - your taxes are doubling. 5. We're gonna cut the deficit by selling North Dakota to Canada. 4. I have tons of experience from being president of the Burt Reynolds Fan Club. 3. Lady, that is one ugly baby. 2. When I'm president, I'm putting Regis on Mount Rushmore. 1. Read my lips: No new wardrobe malfunctions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, after performing poorly in all of the primaries, Senator Joe Lieberman decided to drop out of the race. He dropped out. Yeah. Yeah, when asked about it, Lieberman said, 'I knew I was in trouble when the Jewish guy in North Dakota didn't vote for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Carolina, John Edwards won handily, solidifying his status and helping him fulfill his promise to win every state information born in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the last sign of Joe-Mentum, Connecticut Senator Lieberman, who was banking everything on a strong showing in Delaware, took last night as a sign the game was finally J-Over!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So classy, even his harshest critics show their appreciation. 'Sore Loserman' to 'Good Loserman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They kicked Janet Jackson off the Grammys. You know she got kicked off the Grammys. Is that fair? See, Janet gets kicked off the Grammys, Justin Timberlake stays on the Grammys. See that? You flash your breast, you're in trouble. Reach for a breast, you get to be on the Grammys and you get to be Governor of California.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Joe Lieberman has dropped out of the presidential race after finishing 27 points behind Kerry in South Carolina. 27 points. It wasn't even John Kerry. It was Drew Carey. That's how bad he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cable news channel MSNBC has hired Howard Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, to be a political analyst. Is that a good idea, hiring Dean's former campaign manager? Wait two weeks. You can hire Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John Kerry won five of the seven big contests Tuesday night, bringing him closer to nomination. A number of political analysts say the nomination is John Kerry's to lose, and today Dean said, 'I can show you how to do that. You know, I did that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, one critic in the LA Times said the problem with John Kerry is he looks like he's thinking too much. Well, at least that's one place President Bush has got him beat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about the fight that's going on now between Kerry's people and Bush's people over the military service? Do you know about this? Kerry is saying that Bush never showed up for his National Guard duty. That's what they're saying. Yeah. And now Bush is on the attack. He's accusing John Kerry of ducking time in the National Guard by hiding out in the jungles of Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday, John Edwards won the South Carolina primary. You know his basic stump speech. This whole point is, John Edwards keeps saying there are really two Americas -- one where he tries to hide a Southern accent, and one where he tries to emphasize it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Dennis Kucinich vowed to stay in the presidential race. Stay in? How about getting in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now launching a investigation into prewar intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction. Here's my question. If we do find out we were wrong, does that mean we have to put Saddam back in the hole? How does that work?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week, actually, last night in 1789 that electors unanimously chose George Washington to be the first President of the United States. It was a lot easier to pick presidents quickly back then, because there was no Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they reopened the Senate office buildings that were closed earlier in the week because of that ricin scare, that poison scare. You know what ricin is? It's a toxic poison that's harmful when it's inhaled, or as we call it in LA, air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And lawmakers in Wisconsin have passed a bill that would give $10,000 in tax breaks to anyone who donates an organ. This is the government's new 'Your money or your life' tax plan, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, isn't Wisconsin the cheese state? You want a heart that's been impacted with cheese?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Fox News, Latinos find the term 'illegal immigrant' highly offensive, equating it with a racial slur. They now prefer the more politically correct term, 'Wal-Mart American.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you been watching the Martha Stewart trial? This thing is fascinating. I don't know what this means, but today at the Martha Stewart trial, Martha showed the jury that if you stuff and roast a canary, you can keep it from singing. Now, I don't know what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh's lawyer said today that Limbaugh's drug scandal started with a story in the tabloid newspapers. Really? I thought it started when he bought 40,000 pills from his housekeeper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former California Governor Gray Davis has made a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom 'Yes, Dear,' which has got to be nerve-wracking for him. I mean, knowing at any minute if he screws up, he could be replaced by an actor again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both John Kerry and Wesley Clark are making campaign appearances with the men who saved their lives in Vietnam. That's what they're doing. Meanwhile, President Bush is going to campaign with a man who once took a math test for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know today, George Tenet appeared in front of some kind of committee or held a press conference to explain the intelligence lapses, and it was remarkable. He explained it in a wonderful way. This stuff isn't right, all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of Janet's performance at the Super Bowl, the Grammys will now be on a five-minute delay, so they can take out any mistakes. In fact, Dick Cheney wants to use this technology in all of President Bush's speeches now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all the political gossip has started already. In the new issue of 'Esquire' magazine, they reveal that before he was married to Theresa Heinz, Senator John Kerry dated Morgan Fairchild, Michelle Phillips, Catherine Oxenberg, and Dana Delany. Finally, a Democratic presidential candidate with good taste in women. Thank God. Finally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And next week, the Bush Administration is going to start broadcasting an Arabic language satellite TV channel in the Middle East. President Bush said the channel would tell people the truth about what the United States is doing in the Middle East. Which is pretty good, considering Bush doesn't even tell us that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massachusetts is about to become the first state to allow gays and lesbians to marry. Now, here's the part I don't understand. Wait a minute. Why would a gay guy want to marry a lesbian? You see what I'm saying? What am I missing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another Osama bin Laden video tape that came to our office today. Honest to God this is the newest video tape from Osama Bin Laden.&quot; Bin Laden: &quot;Congratulations to the New England Patriots. You boys won me $500 in the Al Qaeda pool. By the way, did you see the rack on Janet Jackson? That's totally cool. Oh, and death to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, First Lady Laura Bush said that the Janet Jackson breast incident bothered her very much. Yeah, the First Lady said, 'I think it's unfortunate that children and the President had to see that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough week for the Democratic candidates, very tough this week. John Edwards got caught trying to bring a pocketknife through airport security, and Wesley Clark's motorcade got stopped for speeding in Oklahoma. That's true. Yeah, in a related story, Howard Dean can't get arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the key witness in the Martha Stewart trial testified that Martha is 'nasty, rude and arrogant.' Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, Martha's lawyer immediately jumped to his feet and shouted, 'Duh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a scorecard from last night's Grammy awards. Censors, 15, naked breasts, 0. Pretty much a wipeout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see who won a Grammy? President Clinton. Former President Bill Clinton won a Grammy in the children's category for his reading of the classic Peter and the Wolf. I believe Clinton played the wolf.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, the Grammys are not the only show yesterday with a five-minute delay. They had it on Meet the Press. Did you notice? Take a look when Bush was on. Take a look.&quot; Russert: &quot;Would you submit for questioning, though, to the 9/11 commission?' President Bush: &quot;I am...&quot; Leno: &quot;See, there's five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, on Meet the Press yesterday, President Bush was asked what he would do if he lost the election, and Bush said, 'You mean like last time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment when President Bush was asked by Tim Russert if his commission investigating in Iraq was bipartisan. And President Bush said, 'A person's sexuality should play no role.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a harsh critic of Russian President Putin, a man who is a tremendous critic of his, has been given the go-ahead to run against him in the Russian presidential election over there. However, his campaign staff reports he's mysteriously disappeared, he's dropped from sight and nobody can find him. Oh, I'm sorry. That was Howard Dean. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Embarrassing moment last week for Wesley Clark. His motorcade was pulled over by Oklahoma state troopers for speeding. He was speeding. Apparently charged with going nowhere fast, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate John Edwards keeps saying, 'There are two Americas, there are two Americas.' You know, President Bush used to believe there were two Americas. And then, of course, he stopped drinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats say they are now looking for someone to balance a John Kerry ticket. If he gets it, they need someone who can balance him. So I guess that would be someone who's short, bald and married to a poor woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an embarrassing moment today for Vice President Dick Cheney as he went through the White House metal detector this morning. Security made him empty his pockets, and, oops, out fell Justice Antonin Scalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable to me. Vice President Dick Cheney went duck hunting with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, private jet, you know, a hunting reserve up in the mountains. And Scalia went with him while the Supreme Court is still deciding a case involving Dick Cheney's energy task force. Cheney said today there is no conflict of interest. And just to be sure, he said as soon as Halliburton finishes construction of Justice Scalia's new home, he will look into it personally to make sure there is no problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Spirit rover drilled its first hole in the surface of Mars. And today, the Democrats accused President Bush of destroying the Martian environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, a pilot for American airlines, on the American airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York, he asked all the Christians on the plane to identify themselves by raising their hands and then suggested the non-Christians should use their flight time to talk to the Christians about their faith. That's a good idea. That's what you want on planes these days, people arguing about religion. Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, the majority of gun owners are senior citizens. Senior citizens are buying guns in record number. Yeah, yeah. So if Clint Eastwood says, 'I can't remember if I fired five shots or six,' he probably really can't remember.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey! Last night right here on CBS, how many of you watched the big Grammy awards show? Wow. Very, very exciting, three more wins for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are up in arms, apparently there was a pilot on American Airlines who is flying people cross country and began his flight by asking all these people on the plane who were Christians to raise their hands, and then saying to all the other people who weren't Christians, perhaps you can spend the rest of the flight talking to the Christians. Apparently this caused a bit of controversy. Let me just say this. Why? A religious zealot at the controls of an airplane? What could go wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same thing -- it's hard to get good intelligence in the Middle East.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush was on Meet the Press Sunday. A lot of his White House staffers thought it was a bad idea. Hey, it's better than him going on Jeopardy.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Did you watch it? Come on, hey, let's be honest. He didn't seem very well-prepared. Actually, there was a reason he wasn't. See, Bush thought he was just going to 'meet the press.' He didn't know.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;There was one kind of embarrassing moment when President Bush was asked if he was ever AWOL, and he said, 'Oh, no, no, I have Earthlink.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush also said Sunday he wants to lead the world to more peace. More peace -- I don't know, can we take any more of this peace? I mean, it worked so well in the Middle East -- let's spread the peace around a little bit. I can't afford this peace. It's too expensive.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And, of course, the big story now. Now President Bush is coming under attack over his service record in the National Guard. The White House said they have payroll records for President Bush when he served in the National Guard. But today, the commanding officers can't remember seeing President Bush between May and October of '72. Today, Bush said, 'Remember me? The drunk guy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember me?'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And the Democrats are going after him. In a speech over the weekend, Al Gore brutally attacked President Bush and his politics. You know something? If Al Gore really wants Bush to lose in 2004, instead of attacking Bush, he should endorse him. Look what it did to the Dean campaign. Oh, my gosh.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;I love this. In a radio interview over the weekend, Howard Dean says he is now willing to think about taking the vice president slot. Oh, yeah, nothing like losing 12 primaries in a row to give you a little humility, huh? Hey, that mayor of Barstow's looking pretty good now, isn't it?&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;And presidential candidate Wesley Clark said today -- he was getting a little nasty -- he said he's forgotten more about national security than George Bush ever knew. Is that something you want to brag about? I mean, wouldn't you want someone who could retain that kind of information? You want to elect a guy who's going to - 'You know, I had a great plan for the Middle East. I forgot it.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;On Sunday, Senator John Kerry said America needs to be able to trust their president, to which Hillary Clinton said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;You probably heard former President Bill Clinton won a Grammy in the spoken word category. Did you know that? Won a grammy. Isn't that amazing? If you told me a year ago that Bill Clinton would be a Grammy winner and Janet Jackson would be the subject of a government sex investigation, I would have thought you were nuts.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;During his interview on Meet the Press, President Bush said that Iraq could have had 'nucular' weapons. Nucular weapons. Or even worse, nuclear weapons.&quot; Conan O'Brien: &quot;This is true. During his recent interview on Meet the Press, I don't know if you saw this, but President Bush said -- this is a quote - 'I don't think America can stand by and hope for the best from a madman.' That's what he said. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The weird thing is, he was talking about Don Cherry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations once again to senator John Kerry. Won the primaries again last night. Yeah. Yeah. Did very well. Did well. Won Tennessee last night. Polls show he picked up support all across the state. They were worried, you know, he might not win the Southern states. But in fact, in the rural areas, he got over 67% of the mullet vote, which is pretty good.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a profile of John Kerry on the news today, and they said his first wife was worth around $300 million. And his second wife, his current wife, is now worth about $700 million. So when John Kerry said he was going after the wealthy in this country, that wasn't just talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, General Wesley Clark pulled out of the Democratic presidential race. Yeah, yeah. He said he's going to go back to his old job. Being a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he did win Oklahoma. He won the Oklahoma primary. So he ended up finishing 1 for 14, or as we call that in LA, Shaq's free throw shooting record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Howard Dean has a new campaign slogan - 'Hey, maybe you can lose 'em all.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is shocking. Even though Al Gore endorsed him, Howard Dean only got 4% of the vote in Al Gore's home state of Tennessee. He only got 4%. You know what that means? That means he didn't even get all the votes in the Gore family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dean is now saying he won't drop out. He was going to drop out if he didn't win Wisconsin. Now he said, 'No, that's wrong.' He's not going to drop out if he doesn't win Wisconsin on February 17th. He's got his work cut out for him. It's going to be tough to beat John Kerry in Wisconsin. Those Wisconsin people, they're in awe of Kerry. They're cheeseheads, okay? Up until John Kerry, they'd never seen anybody whose head is bigger than theirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not looking good for Howard Dean. In fact, the only way things could get worse for Howard Dean is if Diana Ross was driving the campaign bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all the politicians this week have been speaking out on what they feel is the greatest issue of our time. John Kerry says the economy is the most important issue. President Bush says homeland security, that's the issue. And today, President Clinton said, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, that's the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush stopped off at a bass pro fishing store, picked up a new fishing reel, got some line and some rubber worms. He said he's just going to disappear and go fishing, so he must think he's back in the National Guard again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is turning into a huge problem for President Bush. The Boston Globe is reporting that he got credit for attending National Guard drills in the fall of '72, in the spring of '73, even though his commanders say he never reported for duty. He got credit even though he never showed up. It's like he's an Ohio State football player.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, critics are now saying that his dad got him out of going to Vietnam. However, his dad did get him to go to Iraq. So -&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure if President Bush really understands how big an issue this is. Like today, a reporter asked him if he was a deserter, and Bush said, 'No, I skip the pie and the ice cream, and I go right for coffee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe this is the reason some of you folks are in town, the annual dog show, the Westminster Kennel Club. ... But you know it's not just all about beauty. These dog shows, these dogs are smart, these are very intelligent dogs. I'll give you an idea how smart these dogs are, for example, the Bloodhound who won in his class at the dog show is so smart he actually dug up President Bush's military record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Bush, you can tell that the campaign has now shifted into high gear because now President Bush, whenever he refers to John Kerry, he calls him the 'Senator from the gay wedding state.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The congressional hearings began today into the Janet Jackson's half time Super Bowl scandal, and it's interesting. Congress won't look into Iraq. They're not looking into Enron. But by God, Janet Jackson's bra, they're looking into that!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watching TV last night, I saw an interesting documentary on the ninja. You know, the Japanese soldier? According to legend, the ninjas were warriors who could make themselves invisible whenever there was a war. You know, kind of like Bush in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has now released military documents that they say prove -- prove George Bush met his requirements while in the National Guard. Hey, big deal. We've got documents that prove Al Gore won the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, there is this huge controversy over the fact that President Bush apparently received credit for National Guard service in Alabama in '72 and '73, even though his commanding officers said he never reported. See, I think it's even more disturbing he received enough credits to graduate from Yale. That's what bothers me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the White House did say today that, during the Vietnam War, President Bush was listed as MIA -- Missing In Alabama. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush did have an explanation. He said he did go to Alabama, but when he didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, he went back to Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess today the White House released another document. It was a record of a dental exam, which they say proves that President Bush fulfilled his National Guard service in Alabama. That's it? He went to the dentist? That's proof that he served? Boy, how stupid does Clinton feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He flew all the way to England to get away. He just could have gone to the dentist. You see what I'm saying? You see, that's all you had to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the Democrats, the Democrats are all over this now because they're big strategic guys, the Democratic planner guys, they feel that John Kerry's war record means he can beat Bush. They say when it comes right down to it, voters will always go for a war hero over someone who tried to get out of the war. Yeah, I'll tell that to Bob Dole when I see him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said today he wants to get rid of tax cuts for the rich, and his wife said, 'Hey, shut up! Shut up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday General Wesley Clark dropped out of the Democratic presidential race. Well, you know what? All those campaign stops, he'd give away Clark Bars as kind of a promotion. You know, Clark, he'd give away Clark Bars. See, that's when you know people don't like you. When you can't draw a bunch of Americans and you're giving away free candy, that's a bad sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate John Edwards keeps saying there are two Americas. Unfortunately, they're both voting for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Miami Herald one of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay -- did you hear about this -- turned out to be Osama bin Laden's personal driver. Not only that, the Bush Administration said today we're this close to capturing Ahmed, Osama's pool boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in Miami have detained three men who entered the United States by shipping themselves in a container on a cargo flight. They were in a box, sealed up the box, and they snuck in. Don't worry, they're not Al Qaeda. It turned out they were just Priceline.com. That's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this. At her trial in New York, Martha Stewart's personal assistant broke down on the witness stand yesterday when she recalled how Martha once gave her plum pudding as a Christmas gift. Well, of course, she broke down. Yeah, if your boss was worth over a billion dollars and all you got for Christmas was some crappy plum pudding, you'd be in tears, too, wouldn't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a legal challenge to California law, city authorities in San Francisco officiated at the marriage of a gay couple and they say they will now offer a gay marriage license. Well, some city opponents are against gay marriage. They're concerned that if they start issuing gay marriage licenses, well, then San Francisco could just become a haven for gays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were not aware of this, today is the birthday of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln's birthday. As you know, Abraham Lincoln was a giant man. He was six feet four inches tall and had a beard. If he were alive today he would be detained by Homeland Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, there was kind of an embarrassing moment at the White House earlier today. They were looking around while searching for George Bush's military records -- they actually found some old Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now have you been following this? Says he can't find any National Guard records from the 70s. They are questioning him about it. You were in the National Guard but did you actually show up. He said, 'I'll get the records.' He is having trouble finding the National Guard records from the 70s. Oh, sure but he has no finding photo of John Kerry with Jane Fonda from the 70s. That's easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know they got the Mars -- what do they call it -- the Mars Express orbiter up there. It's amazing. It has just photographed the largest canyon in the solar system. Think about that. It's enormous. Scientists believe it's even a deeper hole now than the one Martha Stewart is in.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy President's Day, everybody. This is the day, of course, we honor our American presidents. Of course, we honor Bill Clinton by having a mattress sale. And, because most people don't have to work today but they still got paid, we honor President Bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear the news? The White House has finally found one guy who says he kind of remembers serving with President Bush in the National Guard. Amazing. Now, just find someone who remembers Bush working on an economic plan. That's the guy I want to meet. Where's that guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found a guy who admits to knowing the President 30 years ago. You know, I think the White House spent more money looking for this guy than they did weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's interesting, the White House is starting to backtrack a little bit on this whole National Guard thing. Like, today, they said President Bush may not have actually attended the National Guard, but he did attend National Guard-related programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush attended the Daytona 500 over the weekend. He's courting the Nascar dads. That's the new thing, Nascar dads. Meanwhile, John Edwards was at the Staples Center for the NBA All- Star game. I guess he was courting the 'kids out of wedlock' dads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a great time at the race. He told reporters, 'I like speed. I like speed.' And, today, he got a call from Rush Limbaugh. 'You too? You know -'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, yesterday, keeps moving on there, Senator John Kerry won primaries in Nevada and Washington, DC. Won both of them. One, of course, a haven for hookers and gamblers, the other, the home of Las Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Boston Herald says Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney may be trying to become the national spokesperson against gay marriage. The national spokesperson against gay marriage. I'll bet that's one title Liza Minnelli's glad to lose, huh? 'Yeah, let him have it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest trend in medicine, now, is for doctors to try and save time by seeing patients in small groups. Have you heard about this? You know what you call a doctor talking to three people at once? A Howard Dean rally. Yeah, pretty much that's what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Dean says, or his people say, if he loses the Wisconsin primary, he'll go back to Vermont and reevaluate his campaign. Reevaluate? The man is a doctor. Can't he tell when something's dead? What are you doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Wesley Clark gave his wife some chocolate as an early Valentine present. ... Well, it was just a box of Clark Bars left over from the ones he had been giving away during his campaign, but it's the thought that counts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning announcement, the FBI and the Army have arrested a 26- year-old National Guard member at his base in Washington state for allegedly trying to pass secrets to Al Qaeda. President Bush was shocked. He said, 'What? You mean people actually show up for National Guard duty?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his annual economic report to Congress, President Bush said that the transfer of American jobs overseas is actually part of a positive transformation that will enrich the US economy over time. So basically, losing your job to someone else can be a good thing - of course we'll see how he feels about that in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a speech yesterday on the spread of Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction. These aren't the normal weapons of mass destruction, these actually exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting -- a former senior aide to Saddam Hussein claims that Hussein was heavily into drugs. So apparently, he and Rush Limbaugh had the same housekeeper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he did heroin and marijuana. In fact, today President Bush said the invasion wasn't really a preemption, it was an intervention. We were just trying to get Hussein into a 12-step program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, President Bush will be at the Daytona 500 for the start of Nascar season. President Bush is a big fan of Nascar. Bush says if it weren't for Nascar, man never would have stepped foot on the moon. Finally, somebody said, 'Uh, sir... hat's NASA.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry today released his plan to eliminate the deficit. He says all we have to do is find a really rich country like Switzerland and marry her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Edwards is on the show tonight, you know he's running for president. Apparently, this is their tradition in their family. On their first anniversary they went to Wendy's because they were in the middle of a move, and now they do it every year. Forget his two Americas speech, this should be John Edward's platform. If he can convince his wife to go to Wendy's for their anniversary, just think what he can convince other world leaders to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Bible translation committee at the Church of England, the three wise men may not have been men at all. So apparently they relied on the same intelligence in the Middle East as President Bush!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All week on NBC they've been running these promos for 'Friends' that say, 'There are only a few Friends left.' Which also describes Howard Dean's campaign: 'Only a few friends left.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you, thank God you folks are here tonight. You couldn't have come on a better night. The entire balcony at the Ed Sullivan Theatr...swear they were in the National Guard with George Bush. They're up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein, first smoked marijuana in '59. That explains his absence from for six months from the Iraqi national guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the big John Kerry juggernaut moves on. He won caucuses in Washington, DC, Nevada and I think in Canada. He is so confident that he's started nailing that intern again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors now about John Kerry being involved with an intern. Ah! You know, having an affair with an intern, and I thought this was interesting, out of habit, Bill Clinton denied it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary said that she would stand by him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the Russian presidential candidate who mysteriously disappeared last week? He was a liberal candidate running against Putin -- disappeared. Well, he has now resurfaced. He now says he was drugged, kidnapped and kept unconscious by his captors. And today, President Bush said, 'The same thing happened to me in the National Guard. I can't believe it.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush spent some time with National Guard troops in Louisiana. In fact, when Bush arrived, the commanding officer said, 'Hey, you're a little late.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he got a lot of flack for that. But, as you may have heard, a retired Alabama National Guard commander says he remembers President Bush showing up there for duty back in the '70s. He said he remembers Bush because Bush used to come into his office, sit there and read. However, payment records from the White House that were just released say, no, that could not have been President Bush. Just the fact that the guy was sitting there reading I think suggests it was not President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say it looks like Howard Dean is doing worse than expected. Worse than expected? This is pretty bad, considering he's expected to drop out of the race. What now, is he being deported? Is that what happened now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Edwards said earlier today, after this Wisconsin primary, we would have achieved our goal of a two-man race. Bad news to Edwards, the two men are John Kerry and George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See who's campaigning with John Kerry? Ted Kennedy. Imagine those two giant heads coming down the street together, huh? Looks like a Macy's Day parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political analysts say that President Bush's reelection strategy is to try and convince Americans that he's a war president. I don't get that. Do you think that will work? I mean, if he convinces the American people that we need a war president, isn't he afraid they're going to vote for a guy who was actually in the war?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since it's an election year, a lot of talk about President Bush spending $87 billion -- $87 billion -- to ensure victory for our men in uniform. I'm sorry, that's George Steinbrenner buying players for the Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Navy auctioning off one of their F-18 fighter jets on eBay. That's for real. Isn't that amazing? You can buy a jet fighter plane. ... The National Guard also selling one of their planes, too. Which is a better deal. In fact, it turns out it was President Bush's old plane, so it was never even used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alex Rodriguez is the highest paid player in baseball, $252 million. That's...yeah, that's amazing. I'm telling you, that kind of money could buy us another day in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'll tell you. I think it's refreshing. I think it's nice to hear about a $252 million contract that doesn't involve Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush attended the Daytona 500. How many folks enjoyed watching the Daytona 500? But President Bush left before the race was over. You know, like he did with his National Guard duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a 27-year-old woman came forth to deny rumors that she had an affair with the Democratic frontrunner, John Kerry. Yeah. Yeah, the woman added, 'I would never cheat on Bill Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush was scheduled to appear at an event in Louisiana with hundreds of National Guard troops. Yeah. Yeah, not surprisingly, Bush said he went, but no one can remember him being there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations once again to Senator John Kerry. Won the Wisconsin primary last night. John Kerry won again. Is it me, or does John Kerry look like Hugh Grant in the year 2050?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Howard Dean dropped out of the race today. Yeah, yeah. Well, at least he can't claim his voice wasn't heard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, political experts are calling Howard Dean's campaign the biggest political collapse, I guess, well, since Bob Dole ran out of Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech today, Dean thanked his wife, his campaign manager, and his support team and all who voted for him in Wisconsin -- which was his wife, his campaign manager, and his support team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know why I feel sorry for him when he goes back to being a doctor? That first patient waiting to get the prostate exam. 'Just get in here! Yes, I'm a doctor again!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know this story. John Kerry has denied the rumor that he had an affair with a younger woman. Turns out the rumor is totally false. Totally false. I mean, anyone who knows John Kerry knows he's always been attracted to older money. He doesn't need young girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were those rumors going around about John Kerry having botox injections. Now there's speculation that President Bush may have had a nose job. You hear this? This is what they said. Apparently, what happened was it started growing when he started telling those stories about the National Guard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Bush visited with a unit of the Louisiana National Guard, and here's the amazing part. It's only been, what, 24 hours since he was there? Yet today, not a single Guardsman can remember ever seeing Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bush was out there campaigning over the weekend. He attended the Daytona 500. It was reported in the paper that Bush was warmly received by the race car drivers. Well, sure, they never met anyone who was sponsored by more oil companies than they were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush said he was troubled, troubled by gay people getting married in San Francisco. He said on important issues like this, the people should make the decision, not judges. Unless, of course, we're choosing a president. Then he prefers the judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm on the Bill O'Reilly diet. The way it works is the only things I eat are my words on Iraq. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, school students in California who speak Spanish are taking far too long to become fluent in English. Hey, we don't have a governor who's fluent in English, all right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Howard Dean? You know he dropped out of the Democratic presidential race. Did you know about that? ... Anyway, Howard Dean dropped out, and he -- he gathered all of his supporters there in Wisconsin and he gave a moving, reflective, screaming, vein- popping farewell speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end, Howard Dean was desperate for votes. Yesterday he called a press conference to announce he was planning on having an affair with an intern. Just didn't have time to get around to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors that President Bush had cosmetic surgery. Did you hear that? Cosmetic surgery on his nose. Sometime recently, President George Bush goes and they worked on that thing. And I said, wow, that's crazy. But I'm telling you, at least you can't get impeached for getting a nose job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in the Oval Office, President Bush said he's troubled by all the gay weddings that have been going on in San Francisco. Yeah. Yeah, Bush says he's also troubled by Bert and Ernie's relationship on Sesame Street. It bothers him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm told by the end of the week, over 3,000 gay couples are expected to tie the knot in San Francisco. You know, I've got to love California. This is the only state where you can marry your gay lover, take a hit from a bong of medical marijuana, be a celebrity who shoots his wife in the head, and not get arrested until you try to light up a cigarette.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he's troubled, he's troubled by all the gay marriages. Well, of course, he's troubled. What else is he going to say? He can't say he's curious. You've got to say 'troubled.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush spoke a little bit more on the subject today. He said the only time two men should ever be in bed together is when one is a lobbyist and one is a politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is President Bush's new children's book. It just came out today. It's 'Where's W?' It's about the National Guard. See, the trick is, you can't find him. That's the trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, Howard Dean dropped out of the race yesterday, and in his concession speech he thanked his wife Judy, and he said his wife Judy defined that a candidate's wife doesn't have to gaze adoringly at her husband but can follow her own career path. Didn't Hillary pretty much define that role? When was the last time you saw Hillary go, 'Oh, Bill, you're the greatest?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's amazing, Dean spent over $40 million, didn't win a single primary. All that money, didn't win. He's like the New York Yankees of politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dennis Kucinich, he didn't even do as well as Dean, and he is still in the race. Even the Chicago Cubs are going, 'Dennis, what are you doing?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize at this point, the only way Dennis Kucinich is going to end up in the White House is if he moves to San Francisco and marries John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in New York City, to make up for the big revenue shortage -- they need so much money, they're taxing everything in New York now. They're now considering taxing breast implants. I'm not making this up. You know what the best job in the world is? Tax appraiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This intern, former intern of John Kerry is claiming now that she did not, she is denying rumors that she had sex with John Kerry. You know what this means, of course. Well, she had sex with John Kerry. That's exactly what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now is my favorite story of the week, a rumor that President George W. Bush had a nose job. He had some kind of plastic surgery. He actually had nose job. If this is true, it would be the first new job he created since taking office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush backed away from his earlier claim that the economy will create 2.6 million jobs this year by saying, 'I'm not a statistician.' That's what he said. Yeah, then Bush said, 'Actually, I'm an Episcopalian.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the head of the AFL-CIO endorsed John Kerry, saying, 'The time has come to unite behind one man, one leader, one candidate.' Yeah. Then he said, 'Until we find that man, we will endorse John Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mardi Gras is, like, that's where you drink, you have wild sex with people you don't even know, women walk by, they flash you, you feel like a football recruit at the University of Colorado. It's unbelievable. How bad it is, today the Taliban denounced the University of Colorado for their treatment of women. Yeah, that's bad.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now expected to endorse a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages. You see, I don't think President Bush really understands this whole gay marriage issue. Like today, he said, 'I don't have anything against gay guys, I just don't want to see one of them marrying my daughter.' You see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now on the campaign trail more and more. He's going out there, meeting the people. Most Republicans say they want to see him serve four more years. Today, the National Guard said, 'Hey, we'd like to see him just serve his last two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this -- according to a new poll, if the election were held today, both John Kerry and John Edwards would beat President Bush by double-digit margins. In fact, listen to this. Now, listen to this -- the White House is so worried about this, they're now thinking about moving the capture of Osama Bin Laden up to next month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had John Edwards on this show. A nice man. He is a seasoned trial lawyer. He's a personal injury attorney. That's what he does. Do you think a lawyer would make a good president? You know, I look at it this way. If we're going to consistently have liars in the White House, why not get a professional? You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry, God bless him -- John Kerry picked up his first endorsement deal today. It's for this new shampoo. Have you seen John Kerry's new shampoo? It's John Kerry's really big Head &amp; Shoulders, giant Head &amp; Shoulders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he is now focusing more and more on jobs. Yeah, his own. Hello.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see what Saddam Hussein said today? You see the press release he's put out? He said he doesn't think America's any safer now that Howard Dean is no longer a candidate. That's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security now working with the United States Post Office on a plan to deliver antibiotics in the event of a terrorist attack. Postal employees will be our first line of defense. That's good to know. That's a great idea. You're sitting in the back yard, you see that mushroom cloud, yeah, just hang around your mailbox six to eight weeks waiting for your Cipro to show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge in the Scott Peterson case has ruled that evidence gathered with GPS technology to track down Peterson after his wife disappeared can be used in court. Yeah. Well, today, listen to this, today Hillary Clinton said, 'You can use a satellite to track your husband? Where was that technology? Why didn't I know about this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The annual toy fair going on this week in New York City. They're going to show what the big toys are going to be, you know, this upcoming Christmas.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that President Bush is upset because a lot of gay people were getting married. Were you aware of that?&quot; Bush &quot;is upset because so many gay men are getting married and Liza Minelli said, 'Tell me about it.' Does that mean anything?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like President Bush will be handing over the power to the Iraqis by June 30th. Handing over power by June 30th. That's amazing. It looks like he will be handing over power to the Democrats by November 2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that the advertising firm that's been hired to produce ads for President Bush's campaign is the same firm that came up with the Taco Bell chihuahua. True story, yeah. Yeah, which explains why, in his new ads, President Bush says, 'Yo quiero another term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Howard Dean ended his campaign for president this week, but so far, he has refused to endorse another candidate. Yeah. As a result, Dean received thank you notes from both John Kerry and John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Now, be honest. Was that for me, or are you just excited Ralph Nader's running for president again? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, on Meet the Press, Ralph Nader announced he is, once again, running for president of the United States. Did you see him sitting there with Arnold Schwarzenegger? The were on together. Ralph Nader and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It looked like the before and after pictures for Bally's Fitness Centers, didn't it?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, listen to this -- Nader's so serious about running this time, he's actually thinking about pressing his suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Nader says he is launching a campaign based on the Internet. Well, that certainly worked out well for Howard Dean, didn't it? Yeah, that was a good idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I don't want to say Howard Dean's Internet campaign didn't work out, but, today, Al Gore said he's sorry he ever invented that Internet thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they were saying in the paper today that Dean could go back to Vermont and become a doctor again. See, this is where I worry that President Bush maybe doesn't understand a lot of these issues. Like, today, when they told Bush that Dean might work for an HMO, he said, 'Hey, as long as he doesn't marry one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of midnight Thursday night, John Kerry began receiving Secret Service protection. A three-car detail of heavily armed agents and a bulletproof limousine pulled up in front of his house and stayed there all night. See, that's what you get when you're the frontrunner. Dennis Kucinich got a whistle and a can of mace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democratic primary now - I guess it's down to John Edwards, who's worth, what? $50 million to $75 million. Or John Kerry, who's married to a woman worth between $500 million and $750 million. So, it's a classic battle between the haves and the really haves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats say that President Bush doesn't have an exit strategy for Iraq. Of course he does. If things don't go well, he exits in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news. President Bush's lapdog passed away. Did you hear about this? I didn't know Tony Blair was sick. Did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, over the weekend, the Bush family dog, Spot, had to be put to sleep. Yeah. Well, he was 15 years old, and the President said they had to put him down due to a series of heart problems over the years. That's got to make Dick Cheney kind of jumpy, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Bush took it really hard. He took it really hard. Well, sure, his alibi was going to be that the dog ate all his National Guard records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor in Washington is that Vice President Dick Cheney might be dumped from the ticket. Well, they're not going to actually dump him. The plan is to take him to another undisclosed location and then just leave him there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a shocking announcement, Governor Schwarzenegger said he supports changing the Constitution to allow people like him to run for President. I'm shocked he would feel that way. ... Well, you know, it's interesting. Well, he combines Ronald Reagan's appeal as an actor, and he has George W. Bush's trouble with the English language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, let's not forget, he's got a little Clinton in there, too. So, hey. He could win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Meet the Press yesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger said that the Mayor of San Francisco should not be allowed to hand out marriage licenses to gay people because this could lead to some other mayors handing out licenses for, like, assault weapons. Which is ridiculous. This is America. Everyone knows you don't need a license for an assault weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Chicago Mayor Richard Daly said he has no problem with gay people marrying. Of course not. They're in Chicago. They didn't have problems with dead people voting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said once again today he is troubled. Troubled by all the gay marriages in San Francisco. He's also troubled by math.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Transportation Board is now preparing to begin fining people. They will fine you if you bring an explosive device on an airplane. I'm sure suicide bombers are going, 'You know, I'd like to blow something up, but I don't have the ten grand for the fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japan today raised their national terror alert to its highest level. They have a similar system to ours. You ever seen the Japanese system? Let me show you. See, here it is. It starts off -- you see, it starts off Hello Kitty. Then it goes to Pokemon. Then the next one is Mothra. And then, of course -- then the highest terror -- Godzilla.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Miami detained three men who shipped themselves in a container on a cargo flight to enter the United States. And the guy who got the shipment, he was really mad. He said, 'Look, I ordered a box of Cubans. I had no idea. You know, really, this is not my order.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York City -- this is absolutely true. Because of all the revenue shortfalls, you know, they need money, they're taxing everything in New York City. They're now considering taxing breast implants. You get breast implants, you get taxed. How does that work? What if you owe taxes on your breasts? How does that work? How'd you like to be that repo guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge is now considering throwing out some charges against Martha Stewart. When Martha heard this, she says, oh, don't throw them out, they can be turned into lovely Japanese lanterns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some sad news. President Bush, his dog Spot passed away, he didn't pass away, they passed him away, and that's sad. And I know how that is, being an animal lover, so they took Spot back to the ranch in Texas, and they buried him on the ranch which I thought was nice. And they buried him right next to, I believe, 10,000 Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, a man believed to be a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden has released an audio cassette in which he reportedly mocks President Bush. So apparently, he's running for president, too, I guess.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Ralph Nader has jumped into the presidential race. Let me tell you, he is going to give Dennis Kucinich a run for his money for last place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, John Kerry, not happy about Ralph Nader getting into the race. But when they told him today, he didn't show any emotion. That's a good thing about those botox injections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So this November, we have a real choice. A choice between the new guy who can screw things up, or the old guy who's proven he can screw things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard these rumors about President Bush dumping Cheney? Have you heard that? Lots of rumors floating around. They say we might not be seeing Cheney in the second term. We haven't seen Cheney in the first term. Where was he? He was hiding out the whole time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of President Bush's dogs, Spot, Spot was put to sleep over the weekend. Yeah. Well, he was 15 years old. He had a series of strokes. Actually, they told President Bush he's now living on a farm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he was the second-most famous Spot in the White House that wasn't considered evidence, when you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security now working with the United States post office on a plan to deliver antibiotics to the American people in the event of a terrorist attack. Which will work out great, unless, of course, the attack is on a Sunday, a holiday or a three-day weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, hey, spring for the extra money. Go Federal Express. At least you'll get your cipro the next day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard Arnold Schwarzenegger was talking about changing the Constitution so he could one day run for president one day. Have you heard about that? So foreign-born people can run for president. In fact, he talked about bringing in a writer to punch up the Constitution. Add some jokes, some action sequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, two-thirds of Americans support the idea of televised executions. And, most of those responding to that poll said they would like Regis to host.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it really kind of looks like now that John Kerry is on his way to the presidential nomination. The only thing that can sink John Kerry now is an Al Gore endorsement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's long time dog, Spot, died. It really is a shame. I love dogs. They end up breaking your heart. It's a sad thing. Really sad, because Spot won't live to see a second Bush term. But then, who will?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said gay marriage is immoral and heterosexual marriage must be defended. That's what he said. Yeah, said it was immoral and heterosexual marriage must be defended. You can tell Bush is serious because he said the new axis of evil is Cher, Bette Midler, and Clay Aiken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week -- very exciting -- consumer activist Ralph Nader announced he would run for president. Yeah, Ralph Nader. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard about it, Dennis Kucinich was furious and said, 'He's going to steal my voter away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think President Bush got his movies a little confused today. Like he said he went to see Lord of the Rings, and then said, 'It wasn't like in the Bible at all.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard this rumor that President Bush may be dumping Dick Cheney from the ticket? Did you hear about this? He doesn't want to drop Cheney, but he felt two guys running together on the same ticket might look too gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush said he wants to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage. Bush feels marriage is something just for straight people, you know, like square dancing, that kind of thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, if we amend the Constitution, it will then be up to Congress to define marriage. Congress defining marriage? That's like letting a University of Colorado football team define when 'no' means 'no,' doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I'm on that new Ralph Nader exercise program. Anybody on this Ralph Nader exercise program? It's not very strenuous. You only run for a couple of months every four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That show, 'The Apprentice,' it is a huge hit for NBC. And tomorrow night's show, especially good. Instead of getting fired, the losing contestant's job is outsourced to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard about this, President Bush has called for what, a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages. A constitutional amendment. Oh, yeah, like he knows what a constitutional amendment is. Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was fascinating, according to a new poll, if the presidential election were held tomorrow, a lot of folks would be taken by surprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The International Red Cross are doing their job. From time to time, they like to check in on the prisoners and Saddam Hussein, they allowed him to write a letter that they would then deliver to his family. He had three kids, there was Uday, there was Qusay, and of course his daughter Uglay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush announced he would support a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage. Yeah. Yeah, Bush said it's wrong for two men to publicly express their love, unless they're trying to get into a fraternity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential hopeful John Edwards is being criticized for patting a wheelchair-bound voter on the head. Pat on the head, yeah. Edwards apologized, saying, 'I should have put the bumper sticker somewhere else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. I've got to tell you, I almost didn't make it here tonight. I was at Rosie O'Donnell's wedding. Yeah, at the end, we all lined up to kiss the bride, and for some reason it took twice as long as normal. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rosie O'Donnell got married today in San Francisco. I'll tell you, I don't think President Bush gets it. Today, he kept asking, 'Who's the lucky guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he was anxious to see the film&quot; the Passion of Christ, &quot;but he said he's a little upset. President Bush was a little upset when he heard it was in Aramaic and Latin. Bush said, 'Why make a movie only Arabs and Latinos can understand?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One critic -- and there are a lot of critics, everybody's got an opinion on this -- one critic said today the one thing missing from the film&quot; the Passion of Christ &quot;is they don't show enough miracles, because you know, that was the age of miracles. But the truth is we still have miracles today. Like Dennis Kucinich beating John Edwards in Hawaii. Huh? Is there a bigger miracle than that? Is that possible?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know by now, John Kerry beat John Edwards in all three primaries this week. He has now won 18 out of 20. Edwards has one win and 19 losses. I can't tell if he's running for president or playing for the Orlando Magic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News said today that catching Osama bin Laden is just a matter of time. Yeah, election time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. Is it me or is President Bush's life starting to sound like a country song? His dog just died, he's in Texas, looks like he might lose his job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, until we can work out a peaceful solution, he wants the Haitian people to stay in their own country. Unless of course they can throw a fastball, a curveball, a slider. Then come on, come on over, no problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is against gay marriages. He says we might have to amend the Constitution. Well, basically, Bush is telling us he has to fix the mistakes made in the Constitution by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and that other idiot, Alexander Hamilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, botox injections can help back pain. That's why John Kerry got a lot of botox -- he's flip-flopping on the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, tennis star Anna Kournikova has gained almost 30 pounds. Or as Bill Clinton calls it, '30-love.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Dennis Kucinich was on the debate, and Larry King - I worry about Larry King. Frankly, he's getting a little older, and I think he's confused, because throughout the debate, he kept asking Dennis Kucinich how often Liza beat him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a scare down in Washington at the White House. A man hopped over the fence surrounding the White House, and he was tackled by Secret Service. And I believe this is the first person to get into the White House unlawfully since Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the city of Washington, DC issued a warning that their tap water may not be safe to drink. Yeah, not only that, President Bush accused the water of being gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, a disturbed man jumped the fence at the White House and raced across the lawn before being tackled by security. Yeah, not surprisingly, it was Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forbes magazine came out with a list of the wealthiest people in the world today. Number one, Bill Gates. Number two, Warren Buffett. Number three, big surprise, the guy who owns the Texaco station over here in Burbank.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you bought gas in California? Two bucks a gallon -- it's more than two bucks a gallon. So apparently, not only did we not find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, we didn't find any oil, either.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Didn't we win? Didn't we win? I thought the gas would be free now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, they're saying it could go to three bucks a gallon. Isn't that unbelievable? Beverly Hills, it was $2.65. See, I think it's a plot by the Republicans to win the reelection. No, no, see. See, by November they're hoping poor people won't have enough money left to drive to the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although he [President Bush] supports a constitutional ban on gay marriages, President Bush says he supports civil unions. You know what that is, civil unions? See, that holds all the legal rights of a married couple, but it's more like an arrangement, you know, than a real marriage. Hey, it worked for the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saddam Hussein was recently visited by the Red Cross, and he is apparently in very good health and expected to stay that way. Until, of course, we kill him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush urged Haitians to stay home and not flee to America. He said, 'Hey, we only have so many jobs at Wal-Mart. You know, there's only so much we can do as a country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to The Journal of Science, they say English was thought to be the most popular language in the world. Now they're saying English is unlikely to become the world's most popular language. The world? It's not even the most popular language in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexican President Vicente Fox caused a huge controversy yesterday by demanding that the United States make it easier for immigrants to cross our border. Easier? What does he want, moving sidewalks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of Smith &amp; Wesson. Anyway, the guy had to quit. He had to quit as chairman of Smith &amp; Wesson. He had to quit after reports came out that he committed a string of armed robberies back in the '50s and '60s, actually spent 15 years in jail. Well, at least he uses the product.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well you heard about this earlier in the week, George W. Bush is calling for a constitutional amendment to ban gay weddings. Sounds like somebody didn't get an invitation to Rosie's wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Rosie and her girlfriend were married in San Francisco. And in case you're interested, I believe they're registered at Home Depot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I mean, this gay marriage thing is huge. Yesterday Senator John Kerry changed his mind and now supports the ban on gay marriages. I'm telling you, this guy -- this guy has more positions than Paris Hilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's debate, John Kerry and John Edwards were so friendly to each other that some political experts think the may end up running together. Yeah, in fact, Kerry and Edwards were so friendly, President Bush accused them of planning a gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are really changing in Iraq. Today in downtown Baghdad, 200 gay couples were married. How about that? Yeah, very exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has taken up the issue of gay marriage, and according to the polls, 50% oppose it, 50% favor it. So the state could go either way. You know what that means? We're bi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, here's some proof that gay marriage may actually work. You know Rosie O'Donnell has now been married longer than J-Lo and Britney Spears combined. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he wants to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriages. In fact, he said today, 'Okay, I am a divider, not a uniter, I admit it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to this point, every single president has been against it. In fact, Bill Clinton, he was against same-sex marriage. Actually, what he meant was he was against sex with the same person you're married to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, down there in Washington DC, a guy jumped over the fence at the White House [and] hopped over the fence, a trespassing guy, and he was brought down by a dog, Secret Service dog.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN predicted that Howard Dean won Vermont, even though he dropped out of the presidential race. That's his home state. Well, you understand why they wanted him to be president. The last thing they wanted was him screaming at them for the next four years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are a lot of propositions on the ballot here in California. Governor Schwarzenegger was on our show last night. Been traveling around the state, pushing his propositions. Believe me, if there's one thing Arnold has proven he knows how to do, it is proposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story in the news, that American authorities helped remove a brutal dictator from power. Of course, we're not going to know the answer to that, of course, until the Martha Stewart jury comes in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story, Martha Stewart is about to be put in the hands of the jury, which stunned Martha. 'The jury? You mean those common looking people sitting over there?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all watch the big finale of 'Survivor Haiti?' Have you seen it, yeah? Aristide voted off the Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been driven from power, and they say Michael Eisner could be next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Bush Administration said today they had nothing to do with the overthrow of Aristide. They said, 'Yes, we were right there with him. Yes, we participated. But no, we were not to blame for what happened.' This is being called the 'Justin Timberlake' defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said we will not get directly involved in domestic and economic problems in Haiti. Of course not. Bush doesn't get involved in domestic problems here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who the first Americans in Haiti were? Does anybody know? Halliburton. Halliburton. Yeah, down there rebuilding before it's even knocked down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian radio is reporting Osama bin Laden was already captured months ago. President Bush denied the rumors and he said, 'No, no, he's not even supposed to get caught until July 4th, you know that.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York papers, Hillary Clinton has been canceling meetings after having emergency dental surgery. Officials say she was swollen and groggy, which could save her marriage, because that's how Bill likes his women -- swollen and groggy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 76-year-old game show producer is suing Dick Clark for age discrimination. Among other things, he's claimed Dick Clark called him a dinosaur. Imagine having Dick Clark call you a dinosaur. That's like George Bush saying you didn't fulfill your National Guard duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks as if mouth to mouth resuscitation will be dropped from CPR training. They're not going to teach mouth to mouth anymore. Not that it's not effective. Apparently the Republican leaders feel it's too gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, by the way, today is Super Tuesday and John Kerry is ahead. But Edwards will not concede until they count all the absentee ballots of honeymooning lesbians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of have you cancelled your vacation in Haiti?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news in Arkansas. They've opened the President Clinton, you know, presidential museum. And you can take your entire family on the Clinton tour for like $10. $10, you get the Clinton tour. For an extra $5, they'll give you a tour of Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Super Tuesday, where ten states got to vote on who should be the Democratic nominee. Yeah. As expected, the winner in all ten states was 'The Lord of the Rings.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Super Tuesday, while campaigning the last couple of days, John Edwards was repeating his key phrase, 'There are two Americas.' Unfortunately for Edwards, neither one voted for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, today John Edwards finally stopped smiling. As you know, John Kerry won Super Tuesday, making this of course, anti-climactic Wednesday, which is what this would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Kerry we will on his way to reaching his magic number of 2,162 -- that's the total number of Democratic delegates he needs to win the nomination. See, with President Bush, it's different. His magic number is five. That's the number of Supreme Court judges needed to win.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry has already begun his search for a running mate. They say because John Edwards still has $50 million in campaign money, Kerry might pick him. Pick him? Hey, for $50 million, Kerry will marry him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry says he wants to be the next black president. Hear me out. In a recent interview, Kerry said Clinton was known as the first black president, and he'd like to earn the right to be the second. Is John Kerry the closest we can get to a black president? How does this make Al Sharpton feel? He's going, 'Hey, guys, hello! I'm an actual black person!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean won Vermont last night, even though he quit the campaign two weeks ago. And Dean said today, 'Think how many states I could have won if I quit sooner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a number of interviews yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney says he's become a lightning rod, a lightning rod. I can understand why he feels that way. If you had to have your heart jump-started every morning...you'd feel like a lightning rod, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors that Cheney will be replaced, but President Bush is very loyal. He says no, he's standing by him. But I don't know how sincere that is. I understand every day, Bush buys Cheney a large cheese and pepperoni pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you watched the news earlier today, you saw in Haiti protesters setting fire to tires. Thousands of tires on fire. You probably saw that. I thought, wow, Firestone must have opened a franchise down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Zell Miller of Georgia -- he says he wants to fine TV stations 25 cents for each viewer they have when they air indecent programming. Here's my question. If smut is only 25 cents per person, why is Cinemax charging me 40 bucks a month?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. In their closing arguments, lawyers for Martha Stewart told the jurors that she is way too smart to commit the crime she's charged with. That'll get the jury on your side, yeah. 'Unlike you idiots, who were too stupid to get out of jury duty, my client is a multimillion-dollar genius.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of New Paltz, New York, has been charged with performing 25 gay weddings this week and could face a year in jail. Which, a year in jail -- you thought he performed a lot of gay weddings before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And looks like more and more Americans are walking, not to stay healthy, just because the price of gas is so high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts are predicting gas will go up to $3 a gallon by the end of the year. But the oil companies go, 'No, no, no.' They say, 'It'll go down to $3 a gallon by the end of the year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a University of Louisville study, women are instinctively attracted to married men. They feel if a man is taken, he must have something worth pursuing or possessing, so they go after him. You know what that means? All this time we've been blaming Bill Clinton, it's really Hillary's fault. It's Hillary's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you no longer super size fries at McDonald's, that was the big announcement, as if this week wasn't bad enough already for Al Sharpton. So, a tough break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So George Bush calls John Kerry to congratulate him on winning the big Super Tuesday and being the Democratic nominee. I'll tell you, this Bush, while he had Kerry on the phone, he also got a $1,000 campaign contribution from him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush said that he believes that Senator Kerry will be 'a tough and hard-charging opponent.' Yeah, yeah. Which explains why Bush's nickname for Kerry is 'Math.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of a small town in New York is facing criminal charges for illegally performing gay marriages. Yeah, yeah. If convicted -- if convicted, he could face up to a year in jail, where he will enter into his own gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all the voting on Tuesday, President Bush called John Kerry to congratulate him. I'm not sure what they talked about. I think we could rule out swapping war stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very nice of him to call John Kerry and congratulate him. I'm sure that was heartfelt. Kind of like Osama bin Laden calling Bush, 'Hey, congratulations on getting Saddam.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's supporters were holding their big victory party, and they showed John Kerry and Ted Kennedy speaking to them on a giant screen. Then I realized it wasn't a giant screen, it was just John Kerry's head and Ted Kennedy's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see those shots of John Kerry throwing the football at the Atlanta airport before his flight? I didn't even know he was on Levitra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after failing to win a single state on Tuesday, John Edwards described his campaign as 'the little engine that could.' And afterwards, Bush called him too and said, 'You're not going to believe this, but I'm reading that book right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John Edwards based his campaign on the fact that there are two Americas, one for the wealthy and one for everyone else. And after his speech, he thanked everyone else, then he went back to the America for the wealthy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Edwards officially dropped out of the race yesterday. See, I love this. I love how candidates always have to make it official when they drop out. We know they lost. When a team loses the Super Bowl they don't hold a press conference the next day, 'Okay, we're going to announce now, it's official.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen President Bush's commercials? Have you seen the song he's using in his commercials? I don't think this was the best choice. Show that president Bush commercial.&quot; Bush commercial: &quot;Don't know much about history. Don't know much biology. Don't know much about science books. Don't know much about the French I took.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dollar hit a 2004 high this week after a positive new jobs outlook report. See, the reason they call it a 'job outlook report' is 'cause to see the jobs, you have to look out across the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about this. You realize the Bush Administration now produced more gay marriages than they have jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's the latest on deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The fighting has stopped. The rebels are in charge. And he's fled to a safe exile. No, I'm sorry. That's Michael Eisner. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Georgia is now considering an online lottery that would let people play up to $5 a day on their credit cards. How despicable is this? Now you can use your Discover Card to discover you're a loser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush campaign for reelection has officially begun. They are actually running television commercials. Have you seen any of the new Bush television commercials? They are getting their money's worth, aren't they? In one of commercials you see George W. Bush for 30 seconds. In another commercial you get to see George W. Bush for 60 seconds. Kind of like his stint in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Turner Broadcasting System is planning -- they are going to have a new Gilligan's Island but it's going to be a reality show. They are looking for an actual millionaire, a sexy movie star, a fat guy and a naive farm girl. And I'm thinking well hell, that's every night at Clinton's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a good week for dictators. You can tell Michael Eisner is starting to feel embattled over there at Disney. In fact, today he spent the entire day in his bunker with his two sons, Uday and Qusay.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Los Angeles yesterday where he announced his new campaign theme, 'Safer, stronger, and tested.' Isn't that a condom ad?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House's begun airing their TV commercials to reelect the President. The John Kerry campaign is condemning his use of 9/11 in the ads. They say it is unconscionable to use the tragic memory of a war to get elected. Unless, of course, it's the Vietnam War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you've seen any of President Bush's commercials, you notice he's by himself. He's all alone. Dick Cheney is not in any of the ads with him. And the rumor is, you know, Bush may be dumping Cheney as a running mate. But Bush, he denies this. He says he stands firmly behind Cheney. In fact, when he's standing behind Cheney, he usually goes, 'Boo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has promised to take this country back from the wealthy. And who better than a guy worth $700 million -- to take the country back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, see, he knows how the wealthy think. Plus, you see, he can spy on them at his country clubs, at his place in Palm Beach, at his house in the Hamptons. He's like a mole for the working man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political experts say -- they say this whole election will come down to a handful of swing voters. You know what a swing voter is? See, that's someone who was against the war in Iraq but has a job at Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft has been hospitalized. They believe he's suffering from homophobia, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, it's just gallstones. But when they gave him the hospital gown that opens in the back, he refused to wear it. He thought it was a gay wedding dress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study at the University of Pittsburgh, sunlight may be a natural painkiller. The more sunlight people receive, the less drugs they need. Oh yeah, wait till the HMO industry gets hold of this. 'You don't need a transplant, just get out on the sun deck for half an hour. You'll be fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm worried about John Kerry. He is so confident now that he is already planning his White House sex scandal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has the two daughters, two beautiful daughters by the way. They may work on their father's presidential campaign after they get out of college. I thought, 'Well, this is a pretty good move because in this economy, they won't be able to find real jobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, more than 800 gay men, 800 gay men staged a protest at City Hall in New York to demand gay marriages. Yeah. Apparently, the protest had to be cut short when everyone decided to put on a Broadway show.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Man! What a crowd. You sound like the inmates at Riker's Island when they heard Martha was coming. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the jury found her guilty on all counts. No one expected that. In fact, they not only found her guilty of obstruction of justice and making false statements. Listen to this -- they also got her for betting on baseball and taking steroids. I mean, they just -- they threw the book at her.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the counts Martha was convicted of was that she was making false statements. Like she actually shopped at K-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said she could get 20 years in prison. Most likely, she's going to get one to three years. Isn't that unbelievable? Unfortunately, the judge did have to tell her today -- there's no such thing as time off for absolutely perfect behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the good news -- Martha got a new TV show. 'Oz.' Yeah, she's gonna do 'Oz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the jurors have been speaking out. You get the feeling if President Bush, John Kerry and Ralph Nader had been in the jury, I think Bush would have voted to acquit her, because she's rich. Nader would have voted to convict her, because she's a multinational corporation. And John Kerry would still be in the jury, 'I'm not sure. What is -'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has unveiled his first campaign commercial featuring all of his accomplishments in office. That's why it's a 60- second spot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he has just one question for the American voters. Is the rich person you are working for better off now than they were four years ago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry says he's considering going to Iraq, but Kerry said he wants to avoid any sense of politics in such a trip. He doesn't want people to think he's going for political reasons. I'm sure he's just going for spring break. That's where everybody goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And soon, Saddam Hussein will have his trial. See, I don't care where his trial is held. I don't even care what he is charged with. My only request, can we get Martha Stewart's attorney to represent him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Jean-Bertrand Aristide is out as President of Haiti. You know what those guys should do? Those guys should move to Beverly Hills and design women's handbags. 'Cause that is the perfect name - what woman wouldn't want to carry a Jean-Bertrand Aristide handbag?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big scandal at UCLA, or as they call it now, 'Used Cadavers, Legs and Arms.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ,' number one again. It's now over $200 million. Unbelievable. And President Bush said he saw the film. See, I don't know if President Bush really understood the movie. Like, he said he liked the film, but he didn't understand why those people were so mad at Yanni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Music legend David Crosby, of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, in trouble again. In his hotel room in Manhattan, police found marijuana, guns, knives, ammunition in his luggage. So apparently, he's trying to make the transition now to rap.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, a lot of people think, 'Hey, Martha Stewart wasn't a threat to our society.' Hey, neither was Iraq, and we went to war with them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, if Martha Stewart had just lied about weapons of mass destruction, she'd be a free woman today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his latest campaign commercial, President Bush talks about times have changed. If he thinks these times are changing, oh, wait till November. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and John Kerry -- John Kerry, he's campaigning in Hollywood, Florida, this week. See, again, he's pandering to the elderly voters, too. Like today he came out in favor of the clapper. Did you see this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, John Kerry has a Purple Heart from Vietnam. Hey, big deal. Dick Cheney's got a Purple Heart from deep dish pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yesterday, the Bush Administration announced a new plan to crack down on the finances of terrorists. Let me tell you something, I think this could work. I mean, if Bush is half as successful at hurting the finances of terrorists as he is the finances of ordinary Americans, I would not want to be in their shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why California's the nutball state. A California state senator has proposed lowering the voting age to 14. Yeah, three words for people who think this is a good idea - 'Governor Jessica Simpson.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This amendment would allow 14-year-olds a quarter vote and 16-year- olds half a vote in all state elections. How stupid is this? You know, we have trouble counting whole votes, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, over 20 members of Iraq's Governing Council made history by signing a temporary constitution. Isn't that good? They signed it. I think this is good. Yeah. Yeah, President Bush said he's thrilled because, although the constitution isn't perfect, it does ban gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another scorcher here in California. Another 90-degree day. I was sweating like Jerry Falwell at a gay wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had something happen to me at work today. I'm coming to work, driving in this morning. This guy gives me the finger. Turns out -- just a a free sample from UCLA. That's what it was. Just a free sample.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he's very concerned about this UCLA scandal. He said, 'What if you've got a hand that came from a gay cadaver?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry was in Florida this week reaching out and talking with elderly voters. You know, I think it made Kerry a little uncomfortable to meet with these elderly people. He finally got a chance to see what he'd look like without botox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to sources close to the CIA, Osama bin Laden may be getting ready to move from Pakistan to Afghanistan. You know why he's going back to Afghanistan? Anybody know? Easier to get a gay marriage license there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is this for a stupid idea? A California state senator has proposed an amendment to the California state constitution that would lower the voting age to 14. Oh, shut -- this is ridiculous. You know what would happen if we allowed 14-year-olds to vote? We'd wind up with someone like an action hero as governor. That's what would happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people here in LA want these new electronic voting machines in the next election, and a lot of people say 'No, no. You've got to keep the paper ballots in case they have to be recounted.' And both are pretty good arguments, but now they have a compromise. They have this thing that's like a voting ATM machine. You enter your vote electronically, but you get a receipt. A voting receipt. That's a great idea. How about a voting 90-day return policy? Wouldn't that be great?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Martha Stewart met with her probation officer this week. You know something? She's in denial, this woman. She still doesn't get it. After their first visit, she tried to fire the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She keeps telling people now she's moving to a gated community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I tell you, this whole Martha Stewart thing reminds me a lot of John Edwards. Remember John Edwards' campaign? This is what happens when a defendant from one America gets the jury from the other America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say Martha Stewart's problem was that she thought she was above it all. That was kind of the whole deal, the attitude. In fact, she's now asking Mel Gibson to do a movie about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the difference between Martha Stewart and God? God doesn't think he's Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Attorney General John Ashcroft had surgery this week. His condition is listed as orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, thankfully, it was successful surgery. We're glad he's doing well. He had his gall bladder removed. Which is good. I think we could all use a John Ashcroft with a lot less gall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, that's the second thing that Ashcroft has had removed, if you count, of course, the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as if McDonald's doesn't have enough problems, listen to this. It seems -- you know the new salad they have at McDonald's? Listen to this. The new salad has 18.4 grams of fat, as opposed to the cheeseburger, which has 11 1/2 grams of fat. Isn't that unbelievable? How sad -- at McDonald's, the cheeseburger is the healthy alternative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they said on the news today, a new study shows that obesity has become the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. 65% of Americans are overweight. Isn't that amazing? In fact, it's so bad now, listen to this -- the Congress now wants a five-day waiting period to buy a donut. Do you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about O.J. Simpson? He's in the news again. He's being accused of stealing satellite TV. But OJ -- again, terrific alibi. He said he was out killing somebody at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story, this week the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency, announced that they've asked Alias star Jennifer Garner to tape a CIA recruitment video. Yeah. Yeah, which is fine, but they also asked Jerry Orbach to look for Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, right-wing Attorney General John Ashcroft had surgery to remove his gall bladder. Yeah, he's doing fine, yeah. The doctor said the surgery was difficult because Ashcroft refused to take his clothes off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin, I've got to admit something. I feel guilty about this. I'm just going to come out and I feel stupid I did this. I'm ashamed. Yesterday I went to UCLA, bought a cadaver just so I could use the carpool lane.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, this is such a horrible crime. They were selling body parts from cadavers that were donated to the university. I mean, that's awful. So after you die now, you can either go to heaven, hell, or eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today he 'knows exactly where he wants to take this country.' Is that good? Last time he took us someplace, it was Iraq. And before that, Afghanistan. Stay home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said today he doesn't care if Osama bin Laden is found in Pakistan or Afghanistan, just so he's found before November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said today he may send his own fact-finding mission to Iraq. And Bush said, 'Hey, look, if you find any weapons of mass destruction, I'll pay you for 'em.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, a little memo to John Kerry. Your mike is on! Your mike is on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, John Kerry described his Republican critics as 'the most crooked, lying group I've ever seen.' And that's saying something, because Kerry's both a lawyer and a politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is not the first time Kerry's been caught when he thought the mike was off. Did you see him last week at that fundraiser? Take a look.&quot; &quot;Kerry&quot;: &quot;Get the botox. Chicks dig a flat forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then just a couple days ago, he's at a retirement home speaking to seniors about health care, didn't realize the mike was on.&quot; &quot;Kerry&quot;: &quot;So the second hooker says to the bartender, 'Here's the $20 back, and you can keep the banana.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Secretary of Commerce Don Evans said that we are trying to get other countries to adopt our economic policies. This is a great idea. Maybe we can convince them to ship some of their jobs over here, too. That would be nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a bill protecting fast food restaurants from being sued by overweight Americans. You know what, we are trillions of dollars in debt, we're on what, high alert? Social Security is broke. Bin Laden's on the loose. What's Congress doing? Passing the 'Cheeseburger Bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say 65% of Americans weigh too much. You know, we are turning into a nation of Clinton girlfriends. Do you realize?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Martha Stewart came out for a ban on gay marriages, especially while she's in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Price of gas, continuing to rise. It's unbelievable here in California. At the gas station near my house they don't even put the price on the sign anymore. It just says, 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FCC now considering stiffer fines for indecency. The fine could go from, I think it's $27,500 to $500,000 if a station airs something indecent. Hey, you know, for $500,000 it better be more than just indecent, okay? For that kind of money, I want filthy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brian:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported this is interesting that just after she was convicted, true story, Martha Stewart called her office to find out who was working and who had taken the day off. Yeah, Martha couldn't hear the answer because the office party was too loud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is in the news. He says yeah, he says he hopes President Bush and John Kerry can have a smart, rigorous campaign without childish name calling. Yeah, in response, President Bush said, 'It's okay with me if it's okay with poopy pants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Tulane University in New Orleans they suspended dealing with a distributor of donated bodies -- listen to this -- after they found out seven cadavers had been sold to the Army and blown up in weapons testing. Isn't that horrible? This is not a good time to be dead in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's campaign is spending $100 million in negative TV ads against John Kerry. Isn't that a bit much? I mean, they only offered $25 million to get Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech yesterday, John Kerry said before November he may go to Iraq. Is that a good idea, John Kerry going to Iraq? You thought Bush had reason to bomb it before. 'Ooh, I'm sorry. We didn't know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, John Kerry speaks French fluently. Did you know that? Democrats are calling Kerry one in a million. Hey, a war hero who speaks French, that's one in a trillion, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week when John Kerry said he wanted to be the second black president? You know, since Bill Clinton was considered the first black president? Well, now a civil rights leader has come forward and asked him to apologize. He says Kerry is a white man born to privilege and has no idea what the black experience is like. And today Kerry said, 'Yo, chill out, brother. Why you dissing me, dog?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest findings from NASA, the planet Mars has high concentrations of sulfur, acid, magnesium, and iron, causing it to give off the odor of rotten eggs. So basically, Mars is like the New Jersey Turnpike in July, basically.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said in the paper today that when in prison, Martha Stewart will have to work for 11 cents an hour. That's what she'll make in prison, 11 cents an hour. But she's not worried. See, she's head of a big American corporation. She can outsource the job to India for 2 cents an hour, save a bundle, still make 9 cents an hour for herself, sit home and do nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another good story. 96-year-old woman, 96-years old, a woman in Cleveland County, North Carolina, arrested for selling crack. How do you think she got caught? 'I'd like to buy some crack.' 'What's that? You want a hat?' 'No, I want crack.' 'A whack?' 'A crack! I want to buy some crack!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study published in the current Journal of the American Medical Association found out that poor diet, lack of exercise may soon be the leading cause of death in this country. Isn't that amazing? They said it may pass tobacco as the number one killer. So this sends a clear message to all obese Americans, if you're fat and out of shape, you might as well start smoking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush launched a new wave of attack ads against John Kerry where he accuses Kerry of being, 'wrong on taxes and wrong on defense.' That's what he said, yeah. Yeah, John Kerry responded with an ad that says, 'George W. Bush, wrong on his SATs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the California Supreme Court ordered that the city of San Francisco must stop marrying gay couples. They said they gotta stop. Not because of legal problems, they're just running out of size 15 heels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 96-year-old woman is facing charges of possessing crack cocaine. 96. Yeah. Police say the woman could get 30 days, or life in prison, whichever comes first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you ready for the March Madness? Do you like the March Madness? Here's how it works. First, you start out with 65. And then one by one, people are sent home until there's only one left. No, I'm sorry, that's our coalition in Iraq. I'm confused.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, in Spain, the voters there have elected a Socialist government. The new Prime Minister, Jose Zapatero, immediately lashed out at President Bush. Calling the war in Iraq a a disaster and calling for all Spanish troops to come home from Iraq immediately. This obviously upset President Bush. Today, he took decisive action. He said, from now on in the United States, Spanish rice will now be known as 'Freedom rice.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' is number one at the post office. In fact, listen to this -- today, Senator John Kerry said he got a call over the weekend from Jesus saying he hopes Kerry wins in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this story? John Kerry caused quite a a controversy last week when he said that world leaders told him they wanted him to win. But he would not say which world leaders told him that. Well, now, he's backtracked on the statement a little bit. Backtracked a little bit. He said -- now he said -- what he meant to say, he's heard from people all over the world who hope he wins. Turns out, the real story is, he was at the International House of Pancakes -- and overheard the people in the next booth talking. That's what it was. That's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, John Kerry met with Al Sharpton. Did you see the two of them standing together? Looks like Abe Lincoln and Ruben from 'American Idol,' pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was kind of embarrassing for Al Sharpton. Remember when John Kerry said he wanted to be considered the second black president, since Bill Clinton was the first black president? Well, that's -- that's why he told Al Sharpton he couldn't be his running mate. He said, 'Look, to balance the ticket, I'm gonna have to go with a white guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration under fire for hiring actors to pose as reporters in video segments, praising this new Medicare law, which is then sent out free to local TV stations. They put it on as news. The spots end with a woman saying, 'In Washington, I'm Karen Ryan reporting.' See, in other words, people think they're watching the news, but it's really the Bush Administration talking. You know, kind of like Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said this week he wants to debate President Bush once a month until the election. Which, this could be a risky move for Senator Kerry. I mean, if Bush doesn't show up for the debate, then John Kerry may end up debating an empty chair, and that could pretty much be a toss-up as to which one has the better personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of that little mistake last week with the microphone being on, the Kerry campaign has hired a professional microphone person, who's only job it is to make sure the Senator's microphone is turned off when he doesn't want to be heard. In fact, it's the same guy who makes Britney Spears turn off her microphone during her concerts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton announced this week he has lost 15 pounds by working out four times a week with a trainer. This trainer showed Bill Clinton a new way to do push-ups. Alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stock market dropped another, what, 130-something points yesterday. It was up a little bit today. See, this is all part of the Bush economic plan. He's trying to make the price of stocks available to even the poorest Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about that woman who was caught trying to pay for her items with a fake $1 million bill? This has not been a good week for Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And airline pilots are very upset over having to take a 14-page psychological evaluation before they can carry a gun in the cockpit. 4% of all pilots flunked the test, meaning they're not stable enough to carry a firearm. The scary part is, they're stable enough to fly a plane at 300 miles-an-hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives, last week, passed a bill protecting fast- food restaurants from being sued by overweight Americans. Now lawyers for overweight people say they're looking for an appropriate way to protest. Hey, I've got an idea. How about a hunger strike?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're looking at a very happy man, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Dave Letterman. I'm the new CEO of Martha Stewart Living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard about this? That John Kerry, he said that, he made a remark, he said a lot of world leaders want him to be the new president and then the Bush Administration said 'Yeah, well like who?' And John Kerry said, 'Well, I can't really...' So now they're really hammering John Kerry. Listen to this. The only name he could come up with, Queen Latifah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had elections in Spain and Spain's newly elected Prime Minister has now announced that he is pulling all Spanish troops out of Iraq. All Spanish troops are being pulled out of Iraq. This is...I believe this is the quickest pullout by a world leader since...well, actually President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that John Kerry's hoping to raise $80 million before the Democratic convention. That's a lot of money. Yeah, Kerry has two ways to raise the $80 million -- soliciting Democratic donors, and going through his wife's purse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush celebrated St. Patrick's Day by declaring war on Ireland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. The Ohio sniper suspect, Charles McCoy, Jr. -- you remember the guy that was on the bridge shooting the people from the overpass for like a year, scaring people, killed one person? He has been arrested in Las Vegas after purchasing a gun. He is described as delusional, paranoid, with long-term mental problems. Well, nice to see those gun background checks are working out well.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess in Cleveland, Ohio, Sioux City, Iowa, they got like ten inches of snow. It was 20 degrees. And President Bush spoke about it today. He said this is exactly why we need global warming to continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry announced that he and his wife are leaving on a week-long vacation. He's going to take her back to the place where he first proposed to her, at her bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said today he stands by -- he stands by -- his claim that certain foreign leaders have told him they hope he wins. And Bush fired back, he told Kerry, 'Oh, yeah? Well, certain Supreme Court justices have told me I'm going to win. So there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry, you know, he has been accused of telling audiences what they want to hear. Like remember a couple weeks ago -- we always talk about this. When he addressed the black audience, and he told them he wanted to be the second black president. Remember, Clinton was the first? Well, that's what he told the black audience. He said he wanted to be the second black president. And today, he told a white audience that he wanted to be the 44th white president. Yeah, so kind of odd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Sharpton said that he is now endorsing John Kerry, but he is not going to abandon his candidacy. He's going to keep running for president even though he's endorsing somebody else. How does that work? You know you lost, yet you continue to go through the motions day after day.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said that President Bush's war in Iraq has cost the former Spanish prime minister his job. That's unbelievable, isn't it? So President Bush isn't just losing American jobs anymore. He's now branching out into other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in France was arrested today for using his car to run down a pedestrian he thought was Osama bin Laden. Even though it was a mistake, it still ranks as France's biggest military victory ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Justice said today they want to make it easier for the government to spy on what websites people have been visiting. Boy, that John Ashcroft is amazing. He's not out of the hospital one day, he's already back on the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jessica Simpson &quot;went to the White House, and she was introduced to Gale Norton, who is the Secretary of the Interior, and she said, 'Boy, you've done a beautiful job decorating the White House.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the National Enquirer, several prison gangs are now targeting Martha Stewart. But Martha says she's going to take her time, she's going to go through the prison gang rush system. You know? Find the one that suits her best. That's what she says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Major League Baseball finally banned the steroid THG from major league baseball. No more. I just hope mom can still get it for her special margaritas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love it when stuff like this happens. Earlier in the month, John Kerry, running for president, and he's speaking somewhere and he's got a microphone on and he doesn't realize that the microphone has been turned on, so he says something embarrassing and he's trying to back peddle and explain. It's one of those silly little things, so as a result of that his campaign now has hired a guy whose sole job is to make sure that John Kerry's microphone is turned off. It's the same guy who used to watch Clinton's fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John Kerry has been meeting with African American leaders, trying to figure out ways to appeal to black voters. Yeah, which makes sense. Unfortunately, President Bush released a new attack ad accusing Kerry of trying to cut bling-bling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spring breaker, that's a weird term, isn't it? Sounds like something a Clinton girlfriend does to a mattress. Oh, she's a spring breaker, that girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're getting down to the final four. Not basketball teams, Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Al Qaeda's number two man is reportedly surrounded by troops in the mountains of Pakistan. Do you know why they call him the number two man? Anybody know? See, he has all the toilet paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They call him the brains. He's the brains of Al Qaeda. Which would make bin Laden, what, the ass?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just saw this on CNN a few moments ago. Several huge explosions went off today near the Baghdad convention center. I'm guessing, isn't that place pretty much empty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Prime Minister of Spain has called the war in Iraq a disaster, and he plans to bring the troops home as soon as possible. The new leader of Spain? Sounds like he wants to be the new leader of America, doesn't it? Doesn't it sound like he's running for President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, listen to this -- President Bush so upset at Spain, he said today he's threatening to close down the border between Spain and the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you've seen any of President Bush's campaign ads, they're starting to get a little nasty now. You know, think we've finally found an American job Bush is willing to fight for -- his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service announced today they are doubling its protection for John Kerry. Well, you can understand why. I mean, with two positions on every issue, he's got twice as many people mad at him. You know what I'm saying? It's going to happen when -- it's got to be double.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an example of what I'm talking about, at a meeting with veterans in West Virginia, John Kerry explained his position on supporting the troops by saying, 'Yes, I actually did vote for the $87 billion for Iraq before I voted against it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that shows you how politics has sped up so quickly. He's now changing positions in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech yesterday at the Reagan Library, Dick Cheney said John Kerry doesn't have the judgment to be president. And believe me, Cheney has seen firsthand what can happen when a guy doesn't have the judgment to be president. So, he knows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Supreme Court Justice Antonin - I think that's how you say it. Antonin Scalia. ... He announced he would not recuse himself from a case involving his friend, Vice President Dick Cheney, despite being Cheney's guest on a recent hunting trip. Cheney took him on a hunting trip, private jet, the whole bit. And Scalia said it is not reasonable that a Supreme Court justice could be bought so cheaply. So he's not questioning the fact that he can be bought. He's just arguing about the price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the actor Olivier Martinez is on the show tonight. He's got this new movie with Angelina Jolie called 'Stealing Lives.' It's about a serial killer who takes on the personality of each person he kills. I don't want to give too much away, but in the movie, he stalks John Kerry, and then decides not to kill him when he realizes, oh, he doesn't have a personality to take over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a documentary airing next month on Cinemax, Hitler was gay. Of course, Bush is thrilled. Now he can blame World War II on gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to get her sentence reduced, Martha Stewart has asked all her friends to write her judge and tell them good things about her. That's true. Yeah, as a result, Martha is expected to get life in prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Arkansas, a house that former President Clinton lived in for about three years is up for sale. Yeah, not surprisingly it was a women's sorority.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show,' everybody. The late night show preferred by eight out of ten foreign leaders, ladies and gentlemen. Who are the leaders? I can't tell you, but they are supporting me. That's all I can say.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the White House announced it was sending a company of troops to Kosovo. So far we've sent American troops to Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti, now Kosovo. President Bush says the goal is to send as many soldiers overseas as we have jobs. That's what we're trying to do.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, we make jokes about it, but the truth is this Presidential election really offers us a choice of two well-informed opposing positions on every issue. Okay, they both belong to John Kerry, but still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Kerry is protected by the Secret Service. I don't want to say Kerry's boring, but his Secret Service code name is 'Al Gore.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's [John Kerry] quite an athlete. They showed him snowboarding. He's in Idaho and he's snowboarding. You see him on the news? He is pretty good. He's a good snowboarder. Man, he was going downhill faster than Howard Dean. It was unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an accident on the slopes. This is true. Kerry snowboarding. A skier collided with him, knocked him to the ground. Kerry got up, called the guy a son of a bitch. That's what he called the guy. In fact, today the FCC fined him $500,000 dollars and told him the next time he goes snowboarding it has to be with a five-second delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Kerry blamed his fall on Bush's environmental policy. He said Bush's global warming has made the snow too wet and more slippery than normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching one of the cable shows today, and they had one of Kerry's advisers on. This guy said there are really two John Kerrys. He said there's the indoor John, who agonizes over decisions, and the outdoor John, who takes bold, decisive action. Outdoor John? Isn't that a port-a-potty? I mean, can't they come up with a better name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are criticizing Kerry for going on vacation this week right when he needs to distinguish himself from President Bush. In the newspaper, they printed titles of the four books he's going to be reading in the five days that he's off. Hey, just reading four books in five days distinguishes him from President Bush right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of oil has hit a 13-year high. What a coincidence. Wasn't it 13 years ago the last Bush was President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? Yesterday the President and Vice President of Taiwan were shot while campaigning. Shot in the stomach. You thought our ads were negative. Oh, my god. That's a negative campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this job outsourcing? It's just gotten terrible. Jobs going overseas. Listen to this. In Utah, residents there, if you have questions about their welfare benefits, they will now be routed to a customer service center in India. 'You can't find a job in Salt Lake, let me get you our New Delhi office.' I mean, how does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to Los Angeles. 93 degrees today. I'll tell you, I was sweating like Condoleezza Rice thinking about facing that 9/11 Commission. Whoo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, at the hearings, Clinton's Defense Secretary, William Cohen, he testified on three occasions Bill Clinton had a chance to kill bin Laden with cruise missiles but didn't pull the trigger. Of course, there's no guarantee that Clinton would have got him. We all know how bad his aim is.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;And it looks like Saddam Hussein may have found himself a lawyer. And surprise, surprise, he's French!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Hussein wanted to find someone to represent him who hates America even more than he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, our friend Al Franken is launching a new all-liberal radio network called Air America. They say the premise of Air America will be to balance out all the conservatives in the media. Except, of course, for NPR, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, and the New York Times.' Other than that...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone has been waiting to see if this left-wing radio thing will be successful. See, I think it's a good idea. I think we should consider different points of view. I like to hear both sides of an issue. That's why I listen to John Kerry. I know sooner or later I'll get both sides of an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Kerry finally cleared up his position on military action in Iraq. He said he voted yes on shock but no on awe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these commentators say -- they say it's our job as Americans to vote. Now, let me tell you something. With Bush in charge of the economy, this might be the only job you have all year. So hang in there.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an article in the paper today that said America is really a place where losers can actually come out ahead. Now, this is true. Like Clay Aiken, who lost on American Idol, he's a big star now, right? Trista, lost on The Bachelor, she's got her own dating show. That Elisabeth Hasselbeck, you know, voted off Survivor island, she's now co-host of The View. George Bush lost the election, became President of the United States. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you happened to see the big pay-per-view Britney Spears special last night on TV? Wow. Here's the scary thing about that. The Bush Administration could have stopped it but failed to act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is fascinating, Saddam Hussein, they pulled him out of a hole and they've had him in a cell and they've been questioning him, he has an attorney now. And I never heard of the guy, but he's apparently a very smart guy, he's already had the trial moved to Los Angeles.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The slogan for the trial is, 'No weapons in Tikrit, you must acquit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy, this attorney, this French guy is famous, he's had a lot of important clients, he defended Carlos the Jackal. Slobodan Milosevic. Clause Barbie. Winona Ryder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news. A hijacking plot was averted today. Did you hear about this? This is terrific. Apparently the hijackers were afraid to get on the plane when they saw that Richard Simmons was on the same flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news from Washington. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice is feeling better after recovering from a sore back. Apparently she twisted it this weekend, trying to duck the 9/11 Commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, she's going to testify. You know, they said, this is breaking precedent. She will now testify publicly before the commission. Apparently she ran out of TV shows to go on, so now she's going to testify.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, though, it's really getting ugly between the White House and the former counterterrorism official, Richard Clarke. Clarke accused President Bush of subterfuge, an accusation that President Bush both denied, and had to look up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this Richard Clarke, he also worked under President Clinton. He said terrorism was always Clinton's top concern. That's what he said, told the committee. He said he was always worried about a terrorist attack. And this is fascinating -- he says President Clinton was first attracted to Monica Lewinsky as a human shield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love it when politicians go campaigning. Senator John Kerry took a shot at President Bush at a black Baptist church this Sunday. He quoted scripture. This is what Kerry said, he said, 'What does it profit, my brother, if someone says he has faith but does not have work?' To which Jesse Jackson said, 'What?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said today that he would bring down the price of gasoline if he is elected president. Kerry said he would arm-twist members of OPEC to lower prices. Do you think that would work with OPEC? Arm twisting? Hey, Bush invaded them and they haven't lowered the price. He blew up the country, and they didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of West Virginia, Bob Wise, very upset. He's asking Abercrombie &amp; Fitch -- you know the company, they sell a lot of high- end stuff -- to stop selling T-shirts with the slogan, 'It's all relative in West Virginia.' That's true. That's what he said. No, he wants them to stop selling, because he says it depicts a negative stereotype of the state. And his wife, who is also his sister, agrees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this? Former President Bill Clinton's boyhood home, childhood home, up for sale on eBay. You can buy it. It's pretty nice. Three bedrooms, two baths and four brand-new tires on it. It is a beautiful, beautiful home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taxi cab drivers are demanding fares go up. That's fair. Everything in this town has gone up. Especially if you're a cab driver. Tolls have gone up, gas is going up, Al Qaeda dues are going up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember a couple months ago, Saddam Hussein, remember Saddam Hussein, the evil dictator Saddam Hussein? They found him hiding in a hole and jerked him out of a hole, and shaved him and checked him for fleas and put him in a cell. Ever since then, they have been interrogating Saddam Hussein. He's not saying a thing. Believe me, they have tried everything. Today he was slapped around by Richard Simmons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, they say that Saddam is stonewalling, he's refusing to talk, not giving out any information. No, wait a minute, that's Condoleezza Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in California, John Kerry made a speech announcing a plan to control gas prices. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'That's crazy, only Dick Cheney can control gas prices.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Signs Your Governor Is Nuts (inspired by reports Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell's car has been clocked at speeds of more than 100 miles per hour nine times since November on the Pennsylvania Turnpike): 10. State has a minimum speed limit of 135. 9. Balanced budget by agreeing to rename state 'Schick Quattro.' 8. Wanted to re- draw borders so state would be in the shape of Garfield the Cat. 7.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, price of gas in California is going crazy. It's going crazy. In fact, today I did something smart. I bought a gallon as an investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how expensive gasoline is out here, coming to work this morning, there were actually people driving in the carpool lane with more than one person in the car. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story in Washington, they are grilling Rice, and, boy, is she steamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, this white house is nothing if not clever. They said they will allow Condoleezza Rice to testify, and they wanted to do it on TV, but it has to be on UPN the night NBC has the final episode of Friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, not only will Condoleezza Rice testify, but President Bush has also agreed to meet with the commission. He's going to testify. But he said he wants to have Dick Cheney there with him. Why does he have to have Cheney with him? What, does he have, like, a learner's permit to be president? You have to have the adult with him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's kind of like that pilot that was with Bush when he landed on the aircraft carrier. You know, they want someone in the plane who knows what the hell they're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Cheney has criticized this Richard Clarke guy. He's the former White House chief coordinator for anti-terrorism. He said he was out of the loop. Well, how's that a criticism of Clarke? Shouldn't the Bush Administration put their chief coordinator on anti-terrorism in the loop? Shouldn't that guy be the loop? Aren't you the loop when you're the chief coordinator?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I hate watching this name calling in these hearings. They keep asking, 'Whose fault was 9/11?' The Bush Administration blames it on the Clinton Administration. The Clinton Administration blames it on the Bush Administration. Hey, how about blaming it on the bin Laden Administration?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, today, John Kerry -- Senator John Kerry had surgery on his shoulder. In fact, kind of funny. When he showed up, out of force of habit, the doctor gave him another botox shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one slightly scary moment during John Kerry's operation. Apparently, the hospital transfusion room ran out of blue blood. Yeah. So it got a little testy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the doctors told him, you know, 'Don't lift anything heavy, you know, like your head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, anybody see MTV last night? You ever watch this show -- you see this 'Choose or Lose' special? John Kerry was on. I love this. John Kerry said he is fascinated by rap and hip-hop. And, hey -- and what Yale- educated white millionaire from Massachusetts is not fascinated?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rap and hip-hop. Flip-flop, I think, is more like it, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if you watch the news at all, I'm sure you know Saddam Hussein has hired a French lawyer. I believe his name is Jacques Cochran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that makes sense, hiring a French lawyer. I mean, if nothing else, Hussein knows how to surrender without a fight. So these two should get it off just fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Al Gore. Al Gore, 57 years old today. 57. Actually, actually -- He thought he was 57. After the recount, 56. Yeah. 56.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Michael Jackson was in Washington DC, where he met with a number of congressmen. He's smart, Michael. See, he knows he may have to lie under oath pretty soon, so he wanted to get some expert advice, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to give you a word of caution here, if you're in a cab and start using your credit card, please be careful. I'll tell you what I'm talking about, I received my MasterCard statement earlier today, and it came back and apparently I made a $6,000 donation to the Taliban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the price of gas? You know what I'm saying? Crazy, it's going sky high and people are absolutely insane about the price of gas. I was driving by a gas station earlier today and I saw the attendant being bitch slapped by Richard Simmons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is still looking for Osama bin Laden and but here's the problem, they can't find anyone who speaks Pakistani. And I'm thinking about this, you want somebody who can speak Pakistani, here's all you have to do: 'Taxi!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former Vice President, Al Gore, has purchased his own cable television channel, the, the Al Gore TV network. And he says it will be a lot like C-Span, but less exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, John Kerry, looks like he's going to be the Democratic nominee for president. You know he had shoulder surgery recently, had something wrong with his shoulder, and he's a tough guy, he had no anesthesia. ... But he had no anesthesia for the operation, he just listened to one of his speeches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, John Kerry appeared on MTV. And he tried to appeal to MTV viewers by saying that he is 'fascinated by rap and hip-hop.' That's what he said. Yeah, then he added, 'Some day I hope to meet them both.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show,' everybody. The late night show preferred by eight out of ten foreign leaders, ladies and gentlemen. Who are the leaders? I can't tell you, but they are supporting me. That's all I can say.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, I fell for the biggest April fool's prank yesterday. I should have known. I spent the whole day in Wisconsin looking for that girl's kidnapper. Oh, what an idiot I was. Doesn't that make you mad? Ooh, that makes me so mad. That girl wasn't missing. She wasn't abducted. She made up the whole story. Same thing Bush did in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, OPEC voted to cut oil production by a million barrels a day. They're cutting production by a million barrels a day. And President Bush, he came up with what he thought was a very clever solution. He said, 'Hey, let's just send them bigger barrels.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest political rumor is -- I love this time of year, I love these political rumors -- is that John Kerry may pick New York Senator Hillary Clinton as his running mate. Have you heard this? I'll tell you, see, that would be just like the good old days for Hillary, working closely with a president she's not having sex with.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the good news, good news, Senator Kerry recovering very nicely after having shoulder surgery. His doctor, Dr. Zarins, said the Senator was fully awake, lucid and joking right after the surgery. He was joking around. But he cautioned that was just the drugs. He'll be back to his boring self in no time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tuesday night, John Kerry held a fundraiser in Beverly Hills. $1,000 a head. $1,000 a head. And since Kerry's head was so big, they charged him $2,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, did you see the guest list? Meg Ryan, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Anniston, Kevin Costner, Barbra Streisand. See, that's the difference between the Democrats and Republicans right there. The Democratic list of stars, it looks like the Oscars. The Republican list of stars, it looks like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, President Bush has reversed himself and decided to allow Condoleezza Rice to publicly testify before the 9/11 Commission under oath. It was a little dicey for a while there because White House lawyers told Bush they didn't want to set a dangerous precedent. And Bush told them, 'Hey, I'm the precedent, I'll decide what's dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Bush and Cheney will make a joint appearance before the commission. They'll answer questions together. And to make sure it's really Bush speaking, they're going to have Dick Cheney drink a glass of water while Bush talks. So it doesn't look like there's any trickery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A 17-year-old high school student has been accused of using his father's name in order to vote in the New Hampshire primary. New Hampshire officials, they're livid about this. They want to know how he fooled the polling place workers into letting him vote. And Florida officials want to know, how the hell did you figure out the ballot? How'd that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, it was revealed yesterday, I love this story, that our Governor, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, recently took a two-hour training course in preventing sexual harassment. Completed the course. Actually, he didn't take the course. He volunteered to do the demonstrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can pay for your ride in a New York City cab with a credit card, but be very, very careful if you give a New York City cab driver your credit card. I'll tell you what I'm talking about. I got my MasterCard statement back today, and I was billed for a two-year subscription to 'Al-Qaeda Living.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, you know what he's doing right now? He's recovering from shoulder surgery, and right now he's on so many pain pills he -- he can't feel a thing. I mean, he's almost like a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself. Kerry is in a lot of pain today, because he dumped the Heinz ketchup heiress for the Tylenol heiress. That's what he that's how much pain he's in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several reporters have asked Dick Cheney to release his entire medical records, 'cause they say voters are concerned about his health. Yes. Cheney says he won't release his entire medical records, just volumes 1 through 30.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Premium is like three dollars a gallon now. That's the reality. Three bucks a gallon. In fact, gas is so expensive now, SUV now stands for 'stranded utility vehicle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's gotten so bad, illegal aliens in California are now saying, 'We don't want the driver's license, don't worry about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But thankfully, Saudi Arabia has pledged to fight rising oil prices. Let me tell you something, if they can fight rising oil prices like they have terrorism -- oh, we'll be in great shape. Oh, the Saudis. They're our friends -- the Saudis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest from Iraq. Apparently, we are up Shiite creek without a paddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to Time magazine, Condoleezza Rice has been rehearsing for her appearance this week before the 9/11 Commission. They say she's been practicing her answers by having her aides ask her questions. You know, wouldn't it be easier just to tell the truth? Then you wouldn't have to remember -- you don't have to remember the answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, she's gonna testify on Thursday. And listen to this. And to prove she's not hiding anything, she's also agreed to do 'Playboy's' girls of homeland security program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say John Kerry is the first Democratic presidential candidate in history to raise $50 million in a three-month period. Actually, that's nothing. He once raised $500 million in one second when he said, 'I do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see Vice President Dick Cheney threw out the first pitch in Cincinnati. Did you see Cheney throwing that ball? At first I thought it was a new Levitra commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News reports that telemarketers -- this is the big thing now -- telemarketers are now hiring prison inmates to make phone calls. Well, they say this is better than outsourcing the jobs to India. At least they're hiring Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're hiring prison inmates to make these calls. Well, think how exciting that would be for your mom. One day the phone rings, 'Oh, it's Martha Stewart!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Martha Stewart is asking for a new trial on the grounds that one of the jurors who convicted her -- listen to this -- once served red wine with fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie in the country is 'Hellboy,' or as Saddam Hussein calls it, 'Roots.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I almost forgot 'cause of the weekend -- you know, Daylight Savings Time. Did you all remember this, Daylight Savings Time? You all remember to turn the dial on your gas pump ahead one buck? Did you do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it's getting crazy. You know, near my house, my Texaco station is now accepting my 401 (k). Do you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you ever notice how these politicians, they try to relate to the everyday voter? Like, today John Kerry was talking to some union workers about the rising price of gasoline. And he said it was so expensive -- the gas is so expensive now, he has to raise his mainsail all the way up and tack back and forth to get back to his summer home in Nantucket. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news for Democrats -- now over half the country can identify a picture of John Kerry. ... Over half the country can identify a picture of Senator John Kerry. That's very good news. The bad news -- the majority still think he's the dad from 'The Munsters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Getting very testy out there. Yesterday, President Bush got a little upset with a reporter for calling him 'sir.' The reporter said 'sir' instead of 'Mr. President.' Yeah. Man, how upset is he gonna be after the election, when they start calling him 'George' again? Oh, my.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney threw out the first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds opening game there. President Bush, he threw out first pitch at the Dardinals game. Well, it's nice to see they have time for that kind of stuff, now that everything in Iraq is under control, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I thought was unbelievable? And this is absolutely true. Before President Bush threw out the first pitch, the White House released a statement saying the President had been suffering from a sore shoulder. You know, can't Bush do anything without the White House downplaying expectations?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Southern Living magazine has recalled its April issue because of an error in a recipe for dinner rolls that resulted in burns to at least five of their readers. This is pretty serious. It incorrectly instructed people to boil a cup of water and boil half a cup of shortening over high heat for five minutes, which could create an explosion. I believe the recipe is called 'Martha Stewart's Revenge.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;JC Penney has sold its Eckerd Drugstore chain for $4 1/2 billion. It was bought by Rush Limbaugh, I believe, Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Telemarketers are now hiring prison inmates to make phone calls, instead of outsourcing the jobs to India. They say they're hiring Americans. But they're hiring prison inmates. Is that really going to help the average guy? Oh, now your job is being stolen by the guy who robbed your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Persian Gulf state of Bahrain has banned the showing of the Mel Gibson movie 'The Passion of the Christ.' They said it's offensive to Islamic fundamentalists. Apparently, it's not violent enough!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you've seen the movie, you know 'Hellboy' has these horns on the top of his head that he files down every night, so he can blend in. It's the same thing Clinton used to do. Same thing Clinton used to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new movie the Alamo is opening this Friday. Do you know the story of the Alamo? Do you know the Alamo? 2,000 Mexicans overwhelmed a handful of Texans. Oh, no. That was last night at the border. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited. You people are here on a special night. I'll tell you why. Tonight, the entire balcony at the Ed Sullivan Theater is filled with radical Shiite clerics. Glad to have you here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you're driving a cab, now they take credit cards. How many folks would be comfortable giving a cab driver your credit card? You're right to be skeptical. You have to be very careful. You can pay for your ride with a credit card. But be very cautious. I got my as MasterCard statement back earlier today. Listen to this, I was billed for two dozen shoulder mounted rocket launchers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that he is looking forward to the testimony of Condoleezza Rice. That's what it...yeah, he is very excited about Condoleezza Rice's testimony before Congress. Well, it makes perfect sense. He wants to know what was going on, too.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several Democrats started criticizing John Kerry because of all the time off he's been taking from the campaign. He's getting some flak, yeah. Yeah, Kerry couldn't be reached for comment because he was having lunch with Omarosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's a huge thing tomorrow. All the networks are gonna carry&quot; Rice's testimony &quot;live on 10-second delay in case she needs a little more time to get her story straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest forecast for Iraq, Sunni today but tomorrow it will turn to Shiite. That's pretty much the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news from Iraq is we brought the Sunnis and the Shiites together. The bad news is now they formed an army.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has called for President Bush to be impeached for deceiving the American people about the war in Iraq. Ralph Nader wants Bush impeached?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Kerry accused President Bush of catering to rich, as opposed to John Kerry, who just marries them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials around the country are stepping up security on cross-country bus lines. They say be on the lookout for anybody suspicious riding buses cross country. You have ever taken a bus across country? Doesn't everybody look suspicious?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS now says you can deduct weight loss plans off your taxes. Did you know that? You can write it off because the Bush Administration has officially declared obesity a disease. This is true. As opposed to the Clinton Administration, where obesity was just sexy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney now drives the Republican version of a hybrid car. It runs on gasoline and when its gets on the highway it switches over to even more gasoline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, most Republicans are only in favor of electric cars if they have golf clubs tied to the back. It's the only time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they the annual White House Easter egg hunt, it wasn't quite as much fun this year because the Department of Homeland Security said all ever the eggs would have to be colored orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush issued his new presidential directive on terrorism. He told his staff, no more memos!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condoleezza Rice testified last Thursday. In fact, President Bush almost missed hearing her testimony. See, according to the intelligence he received, he thought she was going to testify next Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, when she was finished, President Bush called her from his pickup truck on his ranch in Texas to tell her how good she did. This is true. Isn't that one of the signs that you might be a redneck? When you're making long-distance calls from your pickup truck?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton also testified before the 9/11 Commission. He told them he was always concerned about an attack. In fact, Clinton said he couldn't count how many times he told women in the White House, 'Just keep your head down! Keep your head down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even former Vice President Al Gore met with the commission, which had to be strange for Al Gore. They asked him what he would have done if he had been elected president. He said, 'But I was elected President!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hosni Mubarak visited the ranch at Crawford, Texas, today. At one point, Mubarak asked the President, 'Have you ever seen the pyramids?' And Bush said, 'You know, I'm more of a 'Wheel of Fortune' kind of guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Kerry introduced what he calls the 'Middle Class Misery Index.' He thinks the middle class in this country is miserable. Sure, if you're worth $700 million, being middle class is miserable to you, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on CNN today, they said the price of milk will go up 50 cents a gallon. Milk -- 50 cents. What, is OPEC raising cows now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any folks seen 'The Alamo?' Okay. Don't worry. It's not essential, but while I was watching the movie, I learned a few things I did not realize before. For example, Davey Crockett could have stopped the entire attack if he had bothered to read his daily briefing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush insisted, I thought this was fascinating, that there was nothing -- insisted that there was nothing in the August 2001 briefing which was entitled 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.' He said that there was nothing in that memo that hinted what bin Laden was up to. Really. Okay. Let's just start with the title. Did that tip anybody off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush says that he would have moved mountains to prevent that attack. Yeah, but he draws the line at reading a memo. But other than that...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Monday after Easter, they have the big Easter egg hunt on the lawn of the White House. It's an annual thing and a great big whoopdy- doo and this is interesting. The kids found strong evidence of eggs, but no actual eggs.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a press conference earlier this evening. And this is very thoughtful. Did you see this? He was willing to break up his vacation just to talk to us. And I thought that was great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he used tonight's press conference to announce that the Administration has officially ended their search for Easter eggs. It's over. There are none.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on CNN today that, things go according to plan, the US will hand over power in Iraq on June 30th. Things are going according to plan? What plan? Do we have a plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know when you rent a video and it has that FBI warning at the beginning? Well, Condoleezza Rice now says that is not a warning -- it's a historical document.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the argument continues about President Bush and whether he did anything about that memo. You know, the famous memo that said terrorists are planning a major attack inside the United States. Actually, it turns out Bush was more concerned about another urgent memo he got from Attorney General John Ashcroft that said two gay guys in San Francisco may be planning to get married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the 9/11 Commission also heard testimony from former Attorney General Janet Reno, or as they call her in Washington, the Punisher!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry introduced something called the middle class misery index. He created a new formula. He created this formula to judge how miserable we are, and then he said, 'Right now, the middle-class misery index is the highest it's ever been.' He just invented it yesterday. Of course. 'Oh, look at it. Oh, my God, how horrible! The highest it's ever been!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry also said our nation's college students will be paying off our trillion-dollar deficit for years to come. You think so? Huh? Oh, shut up. You won't even pay 99 cents to download music. You're not going to pay off the deficit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Paula Jones, remember her? The big Bill Clinton scandal. Well, she's written a new book she's trying to get published. The book is called, 'I Said No.' Apparently, it's her attempt to answer the question, 'Is there anything you won't do for money?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She says in her book -- she says she was tricked into posing naked for Playboy after being manipulated by the cameraman. Oh, shut up. You know, what part of 'Take your clothes off' is so clever?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel so stupid. Listen to what I found out. I found out that last night's show, oh, my God. I found out last night's show could have been prevented if I had read my daily briefing. I'm just...I'm sick about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a piece of good news coming out of Iraq to give you an idea that maybe the situation is more stable than we believe, they have opened their first new car dealership. Pretty impressive, isn't it? It's Tariq Aziz Ford, and you take 405 to the Fallujah cutoff and then look for the big neon turban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this dealership, they're already doing a tremendous business. Today a guy took a Taurus out for a test bombing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno was down in Washington, being questioned by the 9/11 Commission. And did you see part of it? It's interesting. She is much less aggressive now since she's off the steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was smart. She use the opportunity to promote her new Janet Reno grill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course George W. Bush, a live press conference from Washington, DC, carried by all of the networks. Such a big deal, that Fox, the Fox television network, they decided they would preempt their American Idol show and have the George W. Bush press conference instead. I thought, 'Well, that makes sense. You don't want too many amateurs on the same night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush held a press conference earlier tonight, and as a result, the Fox network had to postpone American Idol. Yeah, some American Idol fans were confused, kept calling in to vote for the old white rapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's almost done with his autobiography, and apparently, he's been calling up friends and reading them passages. Yeah, friends say every chapter begins, 'There once was a gal from Nantucket.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the White House released President Bush's tax return. Yeah. Not surprisingly, under dependents, the President listed Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is 11:36 on April 14th. So you've got, what, 24 minutes to start looking for those receipts, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow's tax day. Did you all pay your taxes? It's a great day for Americans. Because you get to deal with your two most favorite government agencies, the IRS and the Post Office. All together in one.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I make a full day of it. I like to go by the Department of Motor Vehicles in the morning. Just screw the whole day. Stand in line, pay your taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush released his tax returns yesterday. He listed the economy as a liability. He gets to write that off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush listed his income as $822,000. Do you know what John Kerry calls someone who earns $822,000? Not even worth dating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you this, how many are getting money back? And how many are going to spend it on regular, how many on premium?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas is just nuts here in California. Prices are so high, I didn't tell you this, today I saw Diana Ross and Glen Campbell car pooling drunk together just to save money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched President Bush's entire speech last night? How many are going to watch the final episode of 'The Apprentice' tomorrow night? All right. There you go. There's a problem right there. You get the government you deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno testified yesterday before the 9/11 Commission. You can tell it's the first time a lot of the members of Congress met her in person. They asked her to take a seat. She said, 'I am sitting!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's history for you. It was on this very day that the actor John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln. Which started celebrities getting involved in politics. It continues to this day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another new film opening on Friday, called 'The Punisher.' The punisher is the vigilante who fights crime by acting as his own judge, jury and executioner. And today, John Ashcroft called it 'the feel-good movie of the year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news coming out of Iraq, the first new car dealership has opened just outside of Baghdad. The name of the place is &quot;Crazy Qusay. His prices are insane!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CIA Director Tenet has now testified before the 9/11 Commission, and he said, now this is a scary thing, he said we are still making the same dumb mistakes, that's what he said. Like leaving memos on the President's desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw George Bush in the big press conference last night on TV? About the same number that saw the Alamo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw the President on TV, I think he's only had three prime time press conferences since he's been in office. And I thought he looked calm, I thought he looked confident, I thought he looked focused. That's right, he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a tough press conference for President Bush, he spent the first ten minute trying to pronounce Fallujah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they were asking him this question, and Bush insisted that Iraq is not another Vietnam. He said no, Iraq is not another Vietnam. Well, of course not, he avoided Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching the press conference, and I kept hearing, maybe some of you heard this in the background. You heard like a noise, a small commotion, shuffling around and things being moved, did you hear that? I call my buddy down at the White House, Kenny. ... And I said Kenny, 'What was that noise I heard in the background?' He says, 'Whoo oh, that was John Kerry measuring for drapes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At his press conference last night, President Bush said he could not remember a single mistake he had made in the last two years. The president's exact quote was, 'I ain't made none mistakes never.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his testimony before the 9/11 Commission today, CIA Director George Tenet said it would take another five years to have the kind of intelligence service our country needs. Yeah, thanks for letting everybody know that. Good job! 'We're defenseless for five years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, what a crowd. Apparently you got your refunds already, huh? How many use the easy forms? You use the easy forms? Well, they don't even call them the 'easy form' anymore. They're now called the 'Go ahead and just screw me. I can't find my receipts' form.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney released his tax records yesterday. Kind of embarrassing. He listed President Bush as a dependent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One surprise on John Kerry's return under 'primary income,' he listed, 'I married it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush earned $400,000 for his job as President last year. That's not really that much for being president, really, when you think about it. But, see, President Bush -- he doesn't do it for the money. He does it for the eight months of vacation every year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now -- the other night, President Bush's press conference was preempted by 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the difference between President Bush and American Idol?' See, on American Idol, the one with the most votes wins. See, that's the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his press conference the other night, President Bush said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty, and we've been called by God to use our military power to spread freedom throughout the world. And then he called that al Sadr guy in Iraq a religious nutcase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, he also said God is in favor of a cut in the capital gains tax. That was the other thing, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am really upset about last night. I am boiling about last night. Here is what happened. The CIA failed to warn me about last night's audience. What are you going to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how many of you saw President Bush in the big press conference the other night? How many of you thought he did a nice job? How many of you are thinking to moving to Canada?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watched closely, President Bush had one of those ties on, and because he was on television it had kind of a pulsing, hypnotic effect. Actually the tie was electronically pulsating like that. Now, not to be outdone, earlier today during a foreign policy address, John Kerry was wearing a spinning bow tie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new audiotape from Osama bin Laden. Experts can tell that it's a recent audio tape because in it he makes reference to Omarosa getting fired on The Apprentice, so you can tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new Osama bin Laden audiotape -- did you hear about this? It's very strange. He offers a truce, a truce to all European countries. Now all major European countries have rejected that offer for a truce, except for France, and they surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney released their tax returns. Cheney made more money than the President. Yeah, when asked about it the President said, 'That's true, but he also made more decisions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all get your taxes done on time? You know, we got to thank President Bush. He made it a lot easier for people to do taxes this year. Sure, no job, no income tax. Couldn't be simpler. 'Hey, I'm out of work. What do I care?' There you go.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the big trends this year is people filing online. You do that? You file online? I filed online. Not only did I get a refund, I also got six offers to buy Viagra -- what is it, Levitra? Two for Cialis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of my home state of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, has filed emergency, emergency legislation to freeze a court order allowing gay marriage. We have a gay emergency. We are in code pink, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton did a fundraiser for John Kerry. Look at the picture of these two. Look at this. There they are. There's the fundraiser. You know, Hillary wasn't that close to the Democratic nominee in '92 and '96.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paula Jones is back. She's written a book about sexual harassment called, 'I said no.' And since the book is about sexual harassment, if you touch it, you bought it. That's pretty much the rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And coincidentally, President Clinton has also written a book about his encounter with Paula Jones. It's called, 'Man, How Drunk Was I?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably can't tell this by looking at me, but I had a horrible day. I knew it was one of those things. I knew immediately it was going to be a horrible day, because I get into the cab coming to work this morning, and right there on the dashboard was a Shiite cleric bobble head doll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another one of those audiotapes from that rat bastard, Osama bin Laden. Have you heard the new tape? It's crazy. In the new audiotape he is demanding from now on he be known as 'Hell Boy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two big announcements coming out of Washington, DC. This is kind of sad. The tour of duty for 20,000 troops in Iraq may be extended. That's too bad. And the other announcement, the tour of duty for President Bush may not be extended.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Daily News here in Los Angeles, experts are now saying the porn industry might need government regulation. Finally, a job for Bill Clinton. Get him out of the house. This would be perfect. As the czar, porn czar.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A poll of college students says more college students would rather have President Bush as a roommate than John Kerry. But then again, which one would you rather cheat off of in class?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they'd both be nightmare roommates, don't you? Bush wouldn't know any of the answers, and Kerry would give you two for every question. So, you see, right there, you're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Bob Woodward's new book, Plan of Attack, he said when President Bush first decided to go to war with Iraq, he literally grabbed Donald Rumsfeld, pulled him into the small study just outside the Oval Office, and told him his decision. That's the same little room where Bill Clinton took Monica Lewinsky. You know something? We've got to get rid of that little room. Okay? That's two Presidents in a row nearly been brought down by that stupid little room. Just put a padlock on it, shut the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, John Kerry jumped all over Bob Woodward's claim. Bob Woodward's claim that Saudi Arabia plans to drop the price of oil just before the election. And Kerry said, if he's elected, he would eliminate sweetheart deals with Saudi Arabia. Is that the best way to get elected? Basically, he's saying as President he'll make sure the Saudis always keep the prices high. 'When I'm president, no more discount oil from the Arabs. We're paying top dollar, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush appointed John Negroponte as the new ambassador to Iraq. How'd he get to be ambassador to Iraq? What, did he make a large contribution to the Kerry campaign? Is that how you get that job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know the Spanish word for Iraq? Adios.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Spain now says they plan to withdraw their troops as soon as possible as opposed to waiting until June 30th, as they originally agreed. And, of course, France is furious. France is really upset. You know, Spain is trying to break France's record for quickest retreat, and they will not stand for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prime Minister Tony Blair was at the White House last week, and President Bush said, 'You know, for someone not from this country, his English is pretty good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to The Tonight Show. Man! What a crowd. You sound like John Kerry reading Bob Woodward's new book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Bob Woodward's new book, Plan of Attack, about President Bush, is the number one book in the country. President Bush is very upset about this. First, there was the Paul O'Neill one. He wrote one. Then Richard Clarke had one. Then John Dean had one. Now Bush is going, 'Do I have to read another book?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woodward says in his book that Colin Powell warned President Bush about invading Iraq, and Powell called it 'the Pottery Barn rule.' That's what he called it, the Pottery Barn rule. 'If you break it, you own it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Colin Powell warned President Bush that if he went to war, he would own Iraq's 25 million people and all their hopes and problems. He said, 'You will own it all,' to which Dick Cheney said, 'Does that include the oil wells?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colin Powell also said that other countries may follow Spain and pull their troops out of Iraq. I'm sorry, pull their troop out of Iraq. Well, they've been so helpful, the coalition. They've done a wonderful job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush named a new ambassador to Iraq. The bad news, it's Omarosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jay Leno: &quot;And there's a new leader of Hamas -- or as they call it in Israel, a temp job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Bush Administration said today that the Hamas terrorist organization should be put out of business. And let me tell you something -- if there's one thing the Bush Administration is good at, it's putting people out of business. Don't you worry. They'll be gone like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our old friend, independent candidate Ralph Nader says he thinks the draft is coming back. You think that's true? But then again, Ralph thinks he's coming back. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The politicians are now having a big argument over what they call the misery index. You hear them talk about this. The Republicans say it's inflation and unemployment. The Democrats say it's healthcare and college tuition. I think most Americans have a simpler definition. It's regular, premium, super unleaded. I think that's pretty much in there, pretty much.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our old friend, Tom Brokaw, has announced that his last broadcast on the NBC Nightly News will be December 1st. See, this way he can stay through the presidential election, the Florida recount, and, of course, the final Supreme Court decision. He'll want to cover the whole thing there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ivana Trump is working on her own new reality show called 'Girls on Top.' It's kind of an upscale 'Average Joe,' where ordinary men try to date extremely wealthy, successful women. And today, John Kerry said, 'Who dreams up these crazy ideas?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Bob Woodward's new book, allegedly Dick Cheney and Colin Powell barely speak to each other anymore. But that's not unusual. In every Administration, there are people that don't speak to each other. Bush Administration, Cheney and Powell. In the Reagan Administration, it was Donald Regan and Nancy. In the Clinton Administration, it was Bill and Hillary. So that's not unusual.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush commented for the first time on the Woodward book. Bush said he can't wait for the book to come out on tape so he can find out what all the fuss is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his book, Woodward says the Saudis knew we were going to war with Iraq before Colin Powell did. Hey, big deal. The Saudis knew about 9/11 before we did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a poll of who college students would prefer as a roommate, Bush got 43% of the vote. Kerry got 42%. Isn't that surprising? It's the first time Bush has ever won the popular vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe, no matter what happens in this campaign, Bush will be a two- term President. Okay. One term for his father. One term for him. But, you see, it will be two terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry reportedly making some progress on selecting a running mate. Surprised he hasn't picked Bob Woodward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Kerry says, for his vice presidential nominee, Kerry wants someone who is pro choice, supports affirmative action and who is against George Bush's war in Iraq. So he could pick Colin Powell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Thailand said today, if their troops in Iraq are attacked or even fired upon, they will pull out. Are those troops? Aren't those just tourists, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi leaders have set up a tribunal to try ousted dictator Saddam Hussein for his crimes against his country. They're putting him on trial. So I guess it must be an election year over there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saddam Hussein tribunal, they have a daunting task here. Bringing a rich, brutal dictator to justice. They're not taking any chances. In fact, they are studying the Martha Stewart trial very carefully to see how this is done. Step by step.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, today Saddam Hussein entered a plea of not guilty to his attorney, Mark Geragos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news. Major US exports way up this year. The bad news? Our number one export? Jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fish that produces the beluga caviar is now on the endangered species list. See, that's when you know you have a Republican Administration, when the big environmental issue is, 'My God, save the caviar! We got a party on Thursday! Oh, my God, save the caviar!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Kerry announced his plan for protecting the environment. His wife is gonna buy it and put it in a blind trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger today passed a bill that would help put hydrogen fuel cars on California roads by the year 2010. This bill is a way of putting up tentative feelers to see if hydrogen fuel cars would be viable. Tentative feelers. Isn't that how Arnold got in trouble in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and John Kerry celebrated Earth Day by slinging mud at each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people marked Earth Day by walking to work. They're not environmentalists. They can't afford the gas.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today President Bush spoke about the environment, and he's against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earth Day is Al Gore's favorite day. Did you know that? You know Al Gore's least favorite day? Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Senator Chuck Hagel says it may be time to reinstate the draft. When President Bush heard about it, he said, 'Uh-oh. Does that mean I have to go back to Alabama?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are now debating whether to bring back the military draft, and they may limit it so you would not be drafted if you're married or you're gay. Well, you thought there were a lot of gay marriages before!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now some Republicans are suggesting that John Kerry actually tried to win three Purple Hearts in Vietnam 'cause he knew once you won three, you could get to go home early. What easier way to get out of combat than letting yourself get shot three times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John Kerry has three Purple Hearts for his war wounds, and Dick Cheney has one purple heart from a deep-dish pizza.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on 60 Minutes last Sunday, Bob Woodward suggested the main reason that President Bush took the country to war is that he thinks he's on a mission from God. Of course, the problem with that is that's also Osama bin Laden's reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security announced today that airport screeners, for the most part, perform their jobs poorly. That's good information for our Homeland Security Department to have. As long as they don't broadcast it to the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the major oil companies met with the EPA to discuss lowering gas prices by making a cheaper, dirtier gasoline. What a perfect day to do it, huh? Nice to know the Earth Day message is getting through.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the big story, talk about bringing back the draft. How many against bringing back the draft? Let me see, we don't need to bring back the draft. Here's how you get Americans to sign up. You call it a reality show.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You tell people, 'We're holding auditions for something called GI Average Joe. Okay? People will show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All these books coming out about President Bush. There's Richard Clarke's book, John Dean's book, Paul O'Neill's book. Now Bob Woodward has a book out. It's pretty amazing. Who would've thought that George Bush would be responsible for more Americans reading than almost any other President? It's amazing. He brought literacy to the forefront.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's interesting -- in his new book, Bob Woodward quotes Colin Powell as saying he warned President Bush about the 'pottery barn rule' for invading Iraq. Do you know this? 'You break it, you bought it.' That's what he said. See, instead, maybe Powell should have warned President Bush about the '7-Eleven rule.' You go into a place full of people from the Mideast, there's going to be a lot of shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, I'll tell you -- was it 90 today? 91? 91 degrees. I'll tell you, I was sweating like John Kerry trying to hide his SUV. That's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see this today? You know, Kerry was giving a big speech on the environment, and a reporter asked him if he owned an SUV, and he said, 'No, I do not.' And then the reporter said, 'What about that Chevy Suburban in the driveway?' And Kerry said, 'That's my wife's.' Well, thanks for clearing that up. Nice to see it's not politics as usual. Thank you very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And so far this year, our good friend, the country of Saudi Arabia, has beheaded four people. There were two beheadings just this week. And, you know, they do these beheadings in public. They get huge crowds. You know what's really in bad taste? Last night was bobble head night. And I thought that was bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And according to a poll by Babynames.com, the most popular baby names right now are Aidan for boys, Madison for girls. Least popular names -- Osama and Omarosa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told the Iraqi people that, 'We are not gonna cut and run while I'm in office.' Today, the Iraqi people said, 'Yeah, what about next year when you're not in office?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And US forces in Iraq very busy today, not only fighting but giving coalition troops rides to the airport. Yeah, those guys are real helpful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How 'bout our good friends, Spain? Could they have run any faster? Apparently the Baghdad Hilton has express checkout now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Dominican Republic, they pulled their 300 soldiers out of Iraq. I didn't know they had an army -- did you?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only Dominicans I've ever seen in uniform are playing for the Yankees. I didn't know they had an army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, this coalition in Iraq is not holding up well. It seems these other countries don't want their soldiers policing the Iraqi people. Kind of ironic, isn't it? All these foreign countries are willing to take every American job except this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Bob Woodward's new book, 'Plan of Attack,' Dick Cheney and Colin Powell do not like each other. John Kerry commented by saying, 'If I'm elected, my cabinet will not be divided. Like me, they'll remain neutral and not take sides on any issue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry was talking about his concerns on the environment the other day. I love this. A reporter asked him if he owned the SUV that was in his driveway. He said, 'No, I don't own it. It belongs to my wife.' The car that was in the living room? That belonged to Billy Joel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's memoirs are gonna be released this June. I believe the title of the book is 'Drill Bill.' I believe that's the title of the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had the publisher on TV today. He said Clinton's book could be close to 700 pages. Isn't that amazing? Even Clinton's books are fat. What is it with this guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, our good friend Martha Stewart has extended her deal with Kmart. She's locked in till 2009.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, since Martha got convicted, her line of furniture is actually selling well. It's doing very well. In fact, the two hottest items now are the cot and metal toilet. Those are huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you something, I'm very excited and I'm very proud, I was just notified, I was just notified that on June 30th, Iraq is being turned over to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, likely the Democratic nominee for president, has now released his medical records and turns out that John Kerry still has some shrapnel embedded in his left thigh. And it's interesting because incidentally, President Clinton also has that. Actually it's one of Monica's earrings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess this is in Bob Woodward's book. The big rumor that the Administration made a deal with the Saudis for low gas prices before the election. Did you hear that? And President Bush was asked today if there was any quid pro quo, you know, with the Saudis. And he said, 'I wouldn't know. I don't speak Saudi Arabian.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush's campaign now attacking John Kerry for throwing away some of his medals to protest the Vietnam War. Of course, you know, Bush did not have any medals to throw away. But in his -- in his defense, he did have all his service records thrown out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Spain has withdrawn its troops -- or troop -- from Iraq. And I love the new Prime Minister of Spain. The new Prime Minister said that putting Spanish citizens in Iraq was senseless and dangerous. You know, unlike running with the bulls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Bush was so upset with Spain -- listen to this -- he threatened to deport Antonio Banderas this week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry reportedly flew in his private hairdresser before his Meet the Press interview, for a total cost of $1,000. That's $1,000 for a haircut. Which sounds like a lot, but have you seen the size of Kerry's head?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're just paying him by the hour, you're looking at about eight bucks. You know, that's a lot of work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says young Americans are more excited about voting than ever before, which is good news. They're totally involved in discussing and deciding exactly who deserves their vote. All right, it's on 'American Idol.' But I think it's a beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton's memoir, which is coming out in June, is called 'My Life.' I believe it's an oral history, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say it should be a good read, even for people who are unfamiliar with Bill Clinton. You know, like Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're probably aware of the controversy over Democratic John Kerry. Probably going to be the nominee. Well, there's something about him throwing away his military medal and ribbons. You heard about that. Not to be outdone, President Bush threw away his Alabama National Guard spotty attendance record.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who else's birthday is today? Saddam Hussein. And if you haven't gotten him a gift yet, he could use some weapons of mass destruction. You know, he doesn't -- apparently, he doesn't seem to have any and...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry now under scrutiny for paying, allegedly, $1,000 for a haircut. You hear this story? He reportedly flew his personal stylist in to shape his hair before his Meet the Press interview. $1,000. It's the same guy that works on Mount Rushmore. Same guy that does his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are scheduled to testify before the 9/11 Commission. Right now, they're finalizing the seating arrangement. Should Bush sit on Cheney's right knee or his left knee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Supreme Court listened to arguments about whether Vice President Cheney can prevent documents from his energy task force from being released to the public. The Supreme Court feels it's a separation of powers issue. Do you know what that is? Do you know what that means, 'separation of powers?' That means that people who don't have any power shouldn't be allowed to find out what the people who do have power are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, former President Bill Clinton's office in New York had to be evacuated after a suspicious white powder was discovered in mail addressed to him. Fortunately, it was not anthrax. Turned out to be just some powdered sugar from a doughnut one of his girlfriends was eating. When she mailed it, apparently, it fell in the envelope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Clinton's memoirs, entitled 'My life,' will be released this June. See, they're waiting until June, 'cause that's after the current ban on porno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the best part about this book is -- this is what it said. This was a quote. They said, 'You're getting the story straight from the horse's mouth.' That's what they said. So I guess that means there's an interview with Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kmart has signed with Martha Stewart for two more years. Kmart wants her for two more years. Unfortunately, the government wants Martha for five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk about exciting, this is great news. My cab driver on my way to work this morning, my cab driver was named new head of Hamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Hamas, good gig, they last about as long as Michael Jackson attorneys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrity birthday, ladies and gentlemen, Saddam Hussein, 67 years old today. And unfortunately this year Saddam did not receive a present from his sons Uday and Qusay. However...he did receive a lovely card from his daughter, Uglay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is receiving some criticism, because tomorrow when he testifies before the 9/11 Commission, he's insisting that Dick Cheney be allowed to testify with him. Yeah, not only that, he asked if he could sit on Dick Cheney's lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Saddam Hussein's birthday today. Yeah, you know you're having a bad year when your birthday wish is to be back in a spider hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Volkswagen announced this week that it's trying to sell 10% of its ownership to an Arab government. Yeah. A spokesperson for the company said, 'We think Jews need one more reason not to buy a VW.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight is the beginning of sweeps. You know what that is? The big ratings period. It's all of television. They do they big May sweeps stunts. I think over at CBS Survivor, they have Survivor All Stars. Will and Grace had J.Lo. The 9/11 Commission said they had Bush and Cheney.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney answered questions before the 9/11 Commission earlier today. Bush said he was glad to speak to the 9/11 Commission. In fact, he said he would also be happy to meet with the 7-Eleven people, too. If the they have any questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of like Family Feud. Every time Bush answered a question, Cheney would go, 'Good answer, good answer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? Cheney and Bush, they did not testify under oath. There was no videotape no, audiotape, not even a stenographer writing down the questions or the answers. There's no record of this of any kind. Kind of like Bush's National Guard service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody know why it was kept so secret? Cheney didn't want Colin Powell to find out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so secret, even Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia -- even he didn't know what was said. So, you know, when he's not in on the loop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just like saying the name, 'Prince Bandar.' Doesn't it sound -- sounds like a Batman villain to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that Iraq has a new flag. Yeah, that was their biggest problem. No flag. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Spanish troops arrived home in Spain today from Iraq, and they were treated like heroes. Yeah, by the French!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A terrorist alert was announced today here in Los Angeles. Apparently, malls in west LA have been targeted by terrorists. They say this is the worst threat to hit LA merchants, well, since Winona Ryder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were rumors -- there were rumors of a possible car bomb. Luckily, the terrorist could not find a parking space and just went home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's pretty scary, isn't it? A terrorist threat at a shopping mall. That is pretty horrible news. Unless, of course -- you're a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It said in the paper today that Al Gore has donated $6 million that he had left over from his presidential campaign to help the Democrats win back the White House. Think about it. He had $6 million left over. He only lost by, what, 500 votes? Al, what are you saving it for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize, if Al Gore had given each of those 500 voters $12,000, he'd be president right now?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz, is on the cover of Newsweek magazine this week. And they said, if he is elected president, she would be the oldest first lady in American history. 66 years old. But that doesn't bother John Kerry. He said, 'To me, she looks like a million bucks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President Bill Clinton's New York office in Harlem had to be evacuated after a suspicious powder was discovered in the mail. An envelope came to his office and powder, and they evacuated. When Hillary heard about it, she was pretty upset. Not about the powder. When she heard he wasn't in the office. 'He told me he was working all day!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Enquirer is reporting that Monica Lewinsky wants between $5 million and $10 million for the movie rights to her relationship with Bill Clinton. Listen to this. You know who she wants to play her? Mandy Moore. She wants Mandy Moore to play her in the movie about her life. Mandy Moore. Isn't she skinny? Well, no. I mean, I think Michael Moore would be more like it, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Central Park, two gay men climbed a tree and performed lewd sex acts for four hours. Four hours in front of hundreds of people. Well, they did it because they were upset that their parents did not condone their relationship. So they had sex in this tree for four hours. And when President Bush heard about it, he said, 'See, this is why we need to cut down more trees. This is what's going to happen.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had to be together to testify before the 9/11 Commission, so President George Bush and his little buddy Dick Cheney went into the room together, and they testified together before the 9/11 Commission for about three hours and ten minutes. Here's the condition of the testimony. No transcripts of their testimony, no records whatsoever, no evidence that it ever happened. It's just like Bush and the National Guard. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush and Dick Cheney appeared together before the 9/11 Commission. That's the big story. Yeah. Afterwards, when reporters asked President Bush how it went, Cheney said, 'Just fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush took the time to answer the 9/11 Commission's questions. He bragged that he answered every question. That's what he said. He said he was able to answer every single one. Which is something he could never do at Yale. So that was pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I mean, of course he's going to say he answered it. What is else is he going to say? 'I got six out of ten. That's pretty good.' You have to say you answered every one! Actually, I'm not sure how well it went for the President. I understand he used all three of his lifelines on the first question.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I'll tell you something now. You see, you laugh, but President Bush, very clever. He had the Vice President testify with him. See, that way, if somebody asked a really hard question, Cheney could go into his phony heart attack bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, you know what's really amazing? Democrats Bob Kerry and Lee Hamilton, they're on this commission. They're the lead guys on the commission. They left the meeting early to go to another meeting. Where do you possibly have to go? You're meeting with the President, the Vice President, about the fate of the free world. 'I've got the cable guy at the house. I've got to run. I've got to go. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Teresa Heinz, the wife of Senator John Kerry, is on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine this week. In fact, John Kerry said he first noticed her when she was on the cover of another magazine, 'Fortune.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to Bob Woodward's new book, Colin Powell warned President Bush about invading Iraq. He quoted the Pottery Barn rule. He said, 'you break it, you bought it.' That was the rule he used. See, President Clinton, he believed in the Home Depot rule. 'You either screw it or you nail it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And according to a new Gallup poll out today, 61% of the Iraqis believe getting rid of Saddam Hussein was worth any hardships they're going through. 61% said the war was worth it. The problem -- the other 39% are shooting at us. How do they do that poll? Did a Gallup guy go door-to-door and go, 'excuse me [Leno imitates gunfire] hi, we're taking a -- I'm from the Gallup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Army scientists are now testing a liquid body armor they put on clothes. It stays flexible during normal use but can harden to stop a bullet when hit immediately. Isn't that unbelievable? You know, I'm still impressed by Scotch guarding. You know what I'm saying? I don't know how Scotch guarding works. I pour orange juice on my couch, and it rolls. How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and Federal officials have warned about a possible attack on shopping malls here in the Los Angeles area. Fortunately for us, shopping mall security guards are among the most highly qualified members of the law enforcement community. Yes, sir. Yes, sirree Bob. That's the best and the brightest standing in front of Spencer Gifts there. Yes, sirree Bob. God knows. Jimi Hendrix black light posters. Yes, sirree Bob. In fact, at the mall here in Burbank, they raised the terrorist level to Orange Julius today. That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Good news. So far, the only bomb they found at the mall -- the movie 'The Alamo.' That was about it. Well, actually, no. They take all this stuff seriously now. Like, here in west LA, a terrorist task force was sent to investigate this threat, and fortunately, they found no signs of terrorist activity, but they did get some fabulous deals at Robinson- May. Apparently, all the summer line is out now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, the Mars Rover -- remember the thing we sent to Mars? The little car up there? Set a new record when it traveled 292 feet without running into anything. This ties the old record set by Billy Joel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, the Treasury Department unveiled the new $50 bill. You know who's on the $50 bill? Who's on it? Grant. Very good. Grant was a Republican President who was a total failure in school, bankrupted his businesses and somehow wound up as President. Or as Bush calls him, a role model, a trailblazer, a leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Michael Jackson entered a not guilty plea today up in Santa Maria to ten charges against him. Ten charges. That's one per finger. I'll tell you, Michael is taking no chances. Today at his hearing, he would only answer questions with Dick Cheney at his side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know the 9/11 Commission. They wanted to have President Bush and also Vice President Cheney testify in front of the 9/11 Commission and President Bush said I'll go if Dick goes and...then Dick says, well, if George goes, I'll go, so -- for some reason they go together, and they -- they testify. It took place yesterday. This is unbelievable. As a result of that testimony, somehow they raised $20 million for their reelection campaign. Unbelievable. Just by testifying they would raise so much money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to apologize to folks at home, especially the folks in the studio audience. We started late tonight because we had a power blackout. The power went out three times. We couldn't even get the show started. Finally, what happened was -- as you know, Governor Schwarzenegger is in Israel now. And what he did was he left former Governor Gray Davis in charge, so apparently...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, even the Republicans were talking about global warming, that's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, I was in Washington, DC, over the weekend. Boy, it's sure great to come back to Los Angeles where the people are real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news from Iraq. Kidnapped American Thomas Hamill, you know the guy, the truck driver, escaped from his Iraqi captors. He was rescued by American troops. As he was running away, he kept yelling, 'I'm an American! I'm an American!' He did that so people wouldn't mistake him for the other people running away, you know, like the Spanish coalition troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad news, as soon as the Americans got him, they stripped him naked and took some humiliating photos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, see this on the news yesterday? Senator John Kerry out riding his bike, fell off his bicycle. Luckily, he landed on his wallet so he was fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last month he fell down while snowboarding. This month he falls off his bicycle. Last year, Bush choked on a pretzel and fell off his Segway Scooter. Are these guys running for president or president of the sixth grade?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this over the weekend? John Kerry met at a Cleveland hotel with Al Gore. Boy, that was an exciting weekend. Kerry and Gore in Cleveland. Whoo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court is now deciding whether the president can detain an American citizen indefinitely without legal counsel. What? I'm sorry, isn't this why we left England? Huh? Didn't we have a King George once already? Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart just got a $500,000 bonus from her company, which is pretty good considering she was convicted. Try that at your job. 'Hey boss, guess what, I'm a convicted felon now, any chance of a raise?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the porn shut-down continues here in California because of the health scare. In fact, the only people getting work in porn now are Iraqi prisoners of war. That's it, those are the only ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monica Lewinsky, who's trying to get between $5 million and $10 million for the movie rights to her life story -- oh, good luck. Shut up, lady. She now says she wants Mandy Moore to play her in the movie. And listen to this, Clinton says if they get Mandy Moore to play Monica, he's offered to play himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cab fares in New York City have gone up 26% today. ... The cab drivers need the pay hike to cover their Al Qaeda dues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, you know what he's doing, he's campaigning, he's taking a bus ride through Michigan this week and I was thinking, 'Well, in Michigan, I bet he'll get a pretty good turnout, since nobody in Michigan has a job to go to.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush's campaign bus is a technological marvel, it gets $2 million per gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry over the weekend fell off his bicycle. He later denied it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush has a slight lead, has a slight lead over Kerry so, today Bush hung a banner over the White House that read 'Mission Accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, John Kerry fell off his bicycle over the weekend. This is true. He went for a Sunday afternoon ride, fell off in front of the news media. Luckily, his hair broke the fall.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully, Senator Kerry was not seriously injured. In fact, when the police arrived, Kerry was well enough to give conflicting reports to the officer about what happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he said he just lost his balance. And today, George Bush said, 'See, that's why I ride a three-wheeler. You don't fall off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, President Bush is on a bus tour right now, visiting small towns in Michigan and Ohio because he said, and I quote, 'I find it really fun to go to a place where people don't expect the President to come.' The next place he's going -- a bookstore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, John Kerry was on a bus tour. He went to some of the swing states. And at first, he didn't realize he was riding a bus. He thought it was just another one of his wife's SUVs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court Justice David Souter mugged -- mugged over the weekend while jogging in Washington, DC, late at night in a neighborhood with some tough housing projects. Well, that's a reassuring thought, isn't it? A man who's supposed to be one of the nine wisest people in the nation goes jogging at night by himself through a bad neighborhood. You know, why don't you just tie a pork chop around your neck and talk to a grizzly bear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, police said the assault on the judge appeared to be random, although President Bush said it was clearly an attempt by the Democrats to sabotage the election, because they know, you know, how much Bush needs those judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, the Google stock is going public. They asked President Bush if he's ever Googled. He said, 'Oh, yes, every morning with Listerine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Howard Dean may get his own television talk show. Sure. It's my fault. I lower the standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, doesn't sound like good news to me. The US is bringing back the Ba'ath Party. Have you heard about this? Trying to reestablish the Ba'ath Party? This morning, coincidentally, my cab driver was the member of the 'No Ba'ath Party.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're out there on the old campaign trail. Vice President Dick Cheney made a stop at Wal-Mart earlier today. Cheney says that Wal-Mart is a great American institution. Well, you know, that's true. All workers are Mexican and the stuff is made in China. A great American institution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush definitely has an advantage when he is on the campaign trail. He has, of course, Air Force One and he is riding around in this bus he leased for $45,000 a month and Kerry, real handicap, he's out there falling off a bicycle. And then he denied it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in New Mexico, Senator John Kerry spent the day reading children's books to a group of kindergarteners. Yeah, after hearing about it, President Bush said, 'Showoff!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Bill Gates agreed to pay an $800,000 fine for violating the rules of a stock purchase. On the bright side, in the time it took the judge to say the words ' $800,000,' Gates made $4 million!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush was on Arab TV today condemning the photos of naked Iraqi prisoners. I think he was confused. He started out by wishing the Arab people a happy Cinco de Mayo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he went on to tell the Arab people that the pictures of the Iraqi POWs being abused was abhorrent. Abhorrent. He also said they were terriblement and disgustingment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said, 'In a democracy, mistakes are investigated.' Well, not election mistakes. But, you know, any other mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He gave the interview to a reporter from the Al-Hora news channel. That's an Arab news channel sponsored by the US government that's broadcast in the Middle East. In this country, it's known as 'Fox News.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, we do jokes, but he did not go into this interview unprepared. He said he studied up on his Arabic by watching the movie 'Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts are saying this presidential race could be the country's first $1 billion political campaign. Isn't that amazing? Billion dollars. That's not even counting the $875 raised by Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has been driving across Ohio in a huge campaign bus with 'Bush-Cheney' written on the side of it. I guess yesterday, the President really got startled when another bus went by and said, 'Hey, is there somebody named 'Greyhound' in this race?' How is he doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry will soon be taking a bus tour of some of the swing states. Kerry didn't want to take a bus, but his bicycle, way too dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Kerry, the swing states he needs are Arizona, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. For Bush, the swing states he needs are Florida, Florida, Florida and Florida. Needs those four.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Kerry was here today in Los Angeles. He was courting the Hispanic vote by speaking Spanish. And he showed people he can be dull in two languages. It's not a problem. He's really boring in two languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monica Lewinsky, still trying to get between $5 million and $10 million for the movie rights to her story. She wants Mandy Moore to play her in the movie. I understand Linda Tripp will be played by Brian Dennehy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, by the way, this is exciting and interesting and fascinating. He was interviewed on Arabic television, last night. His interview went very well, lasted about five minutes, he raised $3 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry who is now campaigning actively, he spent the day reading to school kids, reading to like preschoolers and he sat there reading the book to them. And the kids said that Kerry actually lacked warmth and failed to articulate a clear message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then Bush also read to preschoolers and he raised over $3 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell says he may not serve a second term if President Bush is re-elected. Powell is angry that after four years, Bush keeps mistaking him for Cuba Gooding Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Disney Company is blocking the distribution of Michael Moore's new documentary, because it criticizes President Bush. Yeah, when asked if the block has anything to do with the tax break Disney wants from Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a spokesman for Disney said, 'It's a small world after all.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NBC sitcom Friends &quot;really does help people put aside their differences. I understand tonight Dick Cheney and Colin Powell are watching the show together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are those that say, 'Oh, we can't go on without 'Friends.' They won't be able to go on without 'Friends.' But it can be done. I mean, President Bush went into Iraq without friends, and that turned out...oh, okay, bad example.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator John Kerry told reporters that certain 'Friends' cast members told him they want him to be the next president. Yeah. He didn't say which ones, of course. He couldn't name them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know the difference between 'Friends' and the John Kerry campaign? 'Friends' has a theme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, a lot of old favorites going away this month - 'Friends,' 'Frasier,' Martha Stewart, Donald Rumsfeld, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they always mention in these articles about the show how much the world has changed in the last ten years since 'Friends' came on. Do you think it's changed? I mean, ten years ago, the Bush family was obsessed with Saddam Hussein. Michael Jackson was being investigated by the police. And the Lakers were chokin' in the playoffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought they did a pretty good job of keeping the ending a secret, which is -- you know, they taped it in January. And that was pretty good. The only people who knew the end were the writers, the cast, the producers and, of course, Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of my favorite all-time episodes was the one where Monica is fat. You know the one I'm talking about? You know, where she -- you find out when she was younger she was fat, and she liked to go out with older guys. Gee, I wonder how she got the name Monica? That's interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in a Cinco de Mayo celebration, John Kerry spoke in Spanish. So he has now failed to articulate his message in two languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration, now asking Congress for another $25 billion for the war in Iraq. I don't know what they're going to be buying with this money. I think we can rule out any more digital cameras, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Donald Rumsfeld? Looked like it could be a photo finish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is quite a story, isn't it? Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said today that those pictures of Iraqi POWs being humiliated are deeply disturbing. What else is he going to say? 'You know, I found them kind of a turn-on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Rumsfeld really shocked everyone when he said, 'Oh, you should have seen the photos we deleted.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say there's a lot of pressure on Rumsfeld, but today he called Vice President Dick Cheney asking if he could borrow one of those secret undisclosed locations. Just so he can kind of hang out a little bit there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rush Limbaugh spoke out on the Iraqi prison picture today. He said it's entirely generated by the media. What, is this guy on drugs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, he also apologized for the humiliation of these Iraqi prisoners. You know, those photos showing the female soldiers standing over the naked men. See, in the Arab world that is an outrage. Almost as big an outrage as women driving or voting. You know. So it's outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Foreign policy experts say this Iraqi prison abuse thing could be a real setback to relations between America and Arab countries. Yeah, it was going so well, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess we're not the 'Great Satan' anymore. We're just the 'Okay Satan' now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's how bad the situation in Iraq is right now. Supposedly, we still have 40 rolls of film we're afraid to pick up from the Fallujah Photomat. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the Rumsfeld hearing today, one senator said that he had a hard time explaining the photos to his 10-year-old son, to which Michael Jackson said, 'Hey, I'll do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news on John Kerry's bicycle accident earlier in the week. Did you hear about that? He fell off his bike right in front of the media. No, it's true, right in front of all the press. Here's the ironic part. You know where he landed? In the middle of the road. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this weekend a real dilemma for millions of Americans. Do you spend the 90 bucks on a dozen roses for mom or the tank of gas so you can go see her?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of America's biggest HMOs are now offering alternative medicine programs. You know, I thought an HMO was an alternative to medicine, wasn't it? 'Come on, walk it off. You're fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Martie McGwire of the Dixie Chicks. She just gave birth to twins. I believe their names are Uday and Qusay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The final installment of Survivor All Star will be Sunday night on CBS. The show is such a hit they are already planning for the next show. They have competed one castaway. Donald Rumsfeld. He is all set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, you know he has the two daughters. The two Bush girls. They are graduating from college. President Bush says he will not be attending the graduation because he does not want to create a distraction. I believe that's the same excuse he used in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld testified before Congress today. I don't know if you watched that. Okay, uh...no, Donald Rumsfeld said -- this is what he said. He said he didn't read the report on Iraqi prisoners, because it was too long and contained too much information. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Hey, that's my line.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, an Iraqi who worked closely with Saddam Hussein said that despite what has been reported, Saddam only had one body double. The surprising part is, it was Burt Reynolds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're at the Paris Hotel right here on The Strip in Las Vegas. I've got to tell you something. The people in the Paris Hotel have been treating us just great. It's nothing like the real Paris at all. They like us here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what really amazed me about this French hotel? How fluent everyone is in Spanish. I couldn't believe it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, they take this French theme very seriously here at the Paris Hotel. Like this morning, I saw a guy pulled up in a Humvee, two bellhops surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know who I feel sorry for? The people across the street who built the Aladdin. A hotel casino with an Arab theme. Hey, there's a good idea. 'It'll be just like downtown Baghdad! People will flock to the place!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this town almost didn't happen. In fact, the building of the first hotel and casino here in Las Vegas was considered the biggest gamble ever undertaken in the desert. You know, until the Iraqi war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, there was a lot of shooting in Iraq today. In fact, US prison guards went through over 200 rolls of film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw some of these pictures. I was looking at another photo today of these Iraqi prisoners stacked on top of one another. Then I realized it was the Southwest Airline flight from Burbank to Phoenix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, some of those pictures, I mean, you've got to talk about it, it's in the news. That one with the gloating female leading a naked man on a leash. Did you see that one? Another guy naked, handcuffed with panties over his head. You know how much you pay for that in Vegas? Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, we're turning over sovereignty to the Iraqis on June 30th. And then the next day we're turning over the negatives. Yeah, they can have all the pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, who would have ever thought that more naked pictures would come out under the Bush Administration than under the Clinton Administration? Isn't it amazing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you see who won the final episode of 'Survivor?' But enough about Donald Rumsfeld. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that he was responsible for the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners. And today President Bush said the abuse was cruel and disgraceful and an affront to the most basic standards of morality and decency. And then he told Rumsfeld he was doing a superb job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then Rumsfeld said, 'What the hell do I got to do to get fired? Hey! Hello?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a fundraising gathering in Washington, DC, President Bush raised a record $38 1/2 million. The best visual, I saw this in the paper, was a picture of President Bush shaking hands with boxing promoter Don King. And it made history. President Bush is the first guy in history to ever shake hands with Don King and walk away with money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today the election will be decided by the American people. So I guess we're actually going to count the votes this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Dylan said he wants to be a judge on American Idol. What's that all about? It's like George Bush being a contestant on Jeopardy, isn't it? Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends is leaving, Frasier is leaving, we finished up Survivor last night, everybody is leaving but Rumsfeld, he isn't going anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush announced that Donald Rumsfeld has the full confidence of President Bush. That's what President Bush said, 'I have full confidence.' I'm thinking, is that really an endorsement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The gas prices are up, the stock market is down, Iraq is a mess and John Kerry is saying to himself, 'How am I going to beat this guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself, this is disturbing, stories coming out about degrading photographs. Nude pyramids, sexual humiliation. Of course, I'm talking about Bill Clinton's memoir.&quot;</SPAN></P>

So people don't like Bush. But they don't seem to like Kerry very much, either. So what we have here -- we have two guys that nobody wants to vote for. No wonder we can't sell democracy in Iraq. We can't even give it away here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amber -- ooh, you know the $1 million winner of Survivor? She's here tonight with her fianc, Boston Rob. Now, if you saw the show -- this is cool. If you saw the show, you know her fellow contestant Rob proposed to her right after the program. See, Rob's philosophy is, if you can't win the million bucks, at least marry into it. You know what I'm saying? Which, I believe, is also the John Kerry philosophy, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Bill Clinton -- how many of you remember Bill Clinton? He has a brand new book coming out in the next couple of months, and the Democrats are worried that the Clinton book might upstage the Kerry campaign. And I'm thinking, 'Hell, a day-old meatloaf might upstage that campaign.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tim Russert has, the man who hosts the NBC Meet the Press, he has a brand-new become out, it's a fascinating book, it's all about his father, it's entitled 'Big Russ.' Now, coincidently, former President Clinton has a brand new book coming out about his years in the White House, it's entitled 'Little Bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said that American politics is becoming meaner and meaner. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, top Republicans said, 'Daschle makes a good point for a guy who's ugly and probably gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld told senators that the Geneva Convention on prisoners rights applies in Iraq, but not for prisoners held in Guant namo Bay. That's what he said, yeah. When asked what the difference was, Rumsfeld said, 'Nobody has pictures of Guant namo Bay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld made a surprise visit to Baghdad, today. He was tired of the open hostility in Washington, he just wanted to get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This summer, President Clinton, you remember President Clinton, Bill Clinton, Crazy Bill, Wild Bill? He is publishing his memoirs. You remember two years ago when he got out of office, or whenever the hell it was, he was given an advance. People say he is writing a memoir by himself. It's an enormous book. 900 pages. He's smart, the book is so heavy, Hillary can't throw it at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rumsfeld's having a very rough week. People are calling for him to step down. In fact, yesterday Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that he has stopped reading the newspaper. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'That's too bad. He's missed a couple of pretty good 'Marmaduke's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rumsfeld keeping busy, though. Earlier today, Donald Rumsfeld flew to Baghdad and made a surprise visit at Abu Ghraib prison. It's true. Yep. Apparently the visit went really well until Rumsfeld got out his camera, and said, 'How about a few pictures?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They asked President Bush today why we didn't observe the Geneva Convention. And Bush said, 'Well, that's easy. We weren't in Geneva. We're in Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This Sunday, John Kerry coming to Las Vegas to campaign and give a speech. Yeah. John Kerry giving a speech -- finally something exciting in Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush delivered a commencement speech at a university in Wisconsin. Very nice, yeah. Very inspirational speech. Apparently, Bush told the students, 'You can do anything in life if your parents work hard enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Bush Administration official told Congress yesterday that the war in Iraq could cost almost $60 billion. $60 billion. Yeah, President Bush said he plans to pay for it with a video series called, 'Prison Guards Gone Wild.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay marriages become legal in Massachusetts next week. And, as a result, lots of wedding planning companies and florist shops have opened there. Yeah. It's true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An article came out today in New Yorker magazine that said, that in order to gather intelligence, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized a secret program that encouraged the sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners.

I mean, I'm not making this up, I feel bad saying it, but there's video of her having group sex with American soldiers in front of Iraqi prisoners.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney gave a speech at the Coast Guard Academy, where he vowed that Americans would fight on in Iraq. And then he said, 'Not actually me.' But other Americans would fight on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should have a law in this country, anybody vowing to fight on should actually have to do some of the fighting, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, things are somewhat back to normal here on the Tonight Show. Yesterday, we had the First Lady. Laura Bush was on the program. It was quite an honor to have her here. We had the Secret Service agents all over the place. You see these guys, they're, like, 6'2&quot;, you know, they wear the suits, they stand there, they never smile. It's like a room full of John Kerrys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, John Kerry and Ralph Nader met face to face. It was a historic meeting. Astronomers said today, their meeting actually created what is called a 'charisma black hole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ever take a good look at Ralph Nader? Doesn't he look like John Kerry after he's been left in the dryer for a couple of days?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Bush honored the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic decision to end segregation in schools. Gee, I thought Bush didn't like activist judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Production is now being suspended on Martha Stewart's TV show. So, if you want to see Martha on TV now, you've gotta watch 'Oz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has endorsed the global warming movie, 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Hope it works out better for the movie than his big Howard Dean endorsement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about cicadas? They come to New York City every 17 years to have sex. And -- no wait a minute, that is the Republican convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was fascinating. Politics is strange and weird. Yesterday, John Kerry met with Ralph Nader. Met with Ralph Nader. Wouldn't you like to have been a fly on the wall for that? And if you were you would have be the most charismatic thing in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry speaks French but tries to conceal it. So if a reporter asks him in a question in French, he will act like he doesn't understand. Bush, on the other hand, has the same problem with English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush met with the prime minister of Greece. True story, yeah. Yeah, in the meeting, Bush praised the Greek people, saying, 'You gave the world Plato, which I once ate a can of.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today -- did you know this? President Bush once worked at Sears in the sporting goods department. I believe he worked there for one four-year term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry met with Ralph Nader Wednesday in a closed-door meeting. It wasn't a secret meeting. It was just so boring, the press closed the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry told the press that he is not asking Ralph Nader to drop out of the race. And today President Bush said, 'Hey, me neither. I don't want him out of there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Nader, actually -- Nader said, 'We have very serious differences with John Kerry.' What's with the 'We?' Shouldn't you have at least one supporter before you can have a we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry and Ralph Nader together. You know, if they just could have gotten Al Gore to show up, they would have had the white guy trifecta, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I don't want to accuse John Kerry of waffling on the issues, but today he appeared in a new Burger King ad, 'Have it both ways.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a more serious note, Senator Bill Frist's son, William Frist Jr., who is a senior at Princeton, was arrested this week in New Jersey for drunk driving. Very serious charge. He's got the same name as his father, who's a powerful Republican leader. Went to an Ivy League school, got arrested for drunk driving. You know what that means? He could go on to become president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A bunch of Hooters calendar girls are going on a three-week tour of Afghanistan. A bunch of hooters girls going to Afghanistan. You know, they love us so much in that part of the country, anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that a case of maybe too much, too soon? I mean, you can't go from women wearing burkas, covering their whole bodies, head to toe, to Hooters girls. You should do it more gradually. Send over, first, some Amish women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strip clubs in Wisconsin have begun voter registration drives in the strip clubs. They're trying to defeat President Bush because he's conservative or something. The strip clubs have these voter registration drives. How many guys are going to use that? 'Honey, I'm going down to Bada-Bing to register to vote. There could be quite a line, I might be a couple of hours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cicadas emerged after 17 years of being underground and they have been asleep for the last 17 years, just like the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC announced that next Monday, they will be replacing 'Fear Factor' with a live speech by President Bush. Yeah, as a compromise to NBC, President Bush will deliver the speech while bungee jumping into a vat of roach dung.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, John Kerry's campaign now has $28 million in the bank. Yeah, after hearing this, Mrs. Kerry said, 'That is so cute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear that Shrek made $104 million this weekend? That is more money taken in one weekend since John Kerry's honeymoon. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I read today that John Kerry and President Bush may be getting together soon. The bad news -- it's to ride bicycles together.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? President Bush fell off his bicycle this weekend. You know what's really sad? It was a stationary bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, on Saturday, President Bush fell off his mountain bike, out on his ranch in Texas. You know, a couple weeks ago, John Kerry fell off his bicycle. See, doesn't that make you miss President Clinton? That guy, he could ride anything without falling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Bush with all those cuts? He looked like he was going on a date with Bobby Brown!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Kerry, now Bush. You know, if Ralph Nader could just stay away from sporting equipment for, like, five months, he could win this election by default.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's really embarrassing? The other day, President Bush said, 'The leaders in Iraq are ready to take off the training wheels.' That's what he said. 'Take off the training wheels.' Then he falls off a bicycle. And we wonder why the rest of the world doesn't take us seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush's bike accident is a little different than John Kerry's accident. See, Bush fell when he tried to turn too hard to the right, and Kerry fell 'cause he kept switching gears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this evening, President Bush delivered an important speech on the future of Iraq. But the TV networks ran their regular programming. So, I guess the speech is important, just not important enough to interrupt 'The Swan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, during the President's speech tonight, he laid out his new plan to hand over power in Iraq. You know, at this point, George Bush saying he has a new plan in Iraq is like William Hung saying he has a new song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and I guess you saw this. More video of that horrible beating coming out of Iraq. Oh, I'm sorry. That was the Laker game. That was the Laker game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Britain, 100 students set a record for naked roller-coaster riding. Did you see that? Show it. Look at this. Show it. Here you go. There they are. Look at these guys. Naked roller-coaster riding. You know, when I first saw it, I thought -- oh, I thought they were taking a bunch of Iraqi prisoners on a field trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strip clubs in Wisconsin now are organizing voter registration drives to get voters to vote for John Kerry, 'cause they're afraid of President Bush's conservative agenda. Think he might close down the strip club. Well, I can see why the strippers would really be for John Kerry. I mean, they have almost as many positions as he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, ladies and gentlemen, crime in New York City is down. The bad news for New York City, it's our number one industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cicadas come out every 17 years, and the ones we're getting now are brazen, oh, my God! Today they made six naked cockroaches form a pyramid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush, did you see what happened to him over the weekend, he fell off his bicycle, did you see that? Wow, this guy has taken a beating, but in all fairness it is not his fault. He couldn't see past the Secret Service agent on the handle bars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then seems like a couple weeks ago, John Kerry also had a mishap on a bicycle and fell off a bicycle so, you have Kerry fell off a bicycle and Bush fell off a bicycle. And the only thing Clinton fell off of was an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush announced his plan for Iraq. He called for the rebuilding of Iraq's economy, getting international cooperation, bringing in new leadership. Same thing Kerry's calling for here, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, the opinions are split on the President's plan. The Republicans say the outlook is Sunni, the Democrats say we're in deep Shiite. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said last night that there will be a new president in Iraq. In fact, to give him a chance, they're going to give him a 30-second head start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He also said Iraq will have two, two vice presidents. See, that's when you know they don't expect the new president to last long.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House announced that the notorious Abu Ghraib prison will be torn down, demolished, done away with. But don't worry, we'll always have the memories. And of course, the photographs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just five weeks away from handing over control in Iraq. And President Bush said it could be extremely tricky and very, very dangerous, you know, kind of like riding a bicycle. It's very tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush fell off his mountain bike this weekend. Luckily, he was not hurt. You know, he was wearing the same helmet he wears when he eats pretzels. So he was okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, first, John Kerry fell off his bike, then Bush falls off his bike. Is it too much to ask? Can't we get someone who can pedal a bike and be president at the same time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know when President Bush fell off his bike? It was the exact moment when he heard Michael Moore won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, he fell off while mountain biking on his ranch over the weekend, which - I guess he hit a rough spot in the trail. That's what it said on the news. There's a switch -- the environment hurting Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John Kerry met with Ralph Nader last week, and both sides of every issue were discussed, and then, of course, Nader spoke.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you bothered by these misleading political ads? And they both do it, both Kerry and Bush. These negative ads they take out on their competitor. Like, did you see Kerry's new ad against Bush? Show that one.&quot; &quot;Kerry&quot; ad: &quot;George Bush is a public man with many secrets. On March 13th, 2003, he secretly met with then-unknown Omarosa from The Apprentice. He left the meeting feeling 'bitchy and aggressive.' One week later, he invaded Iraq. He would never invade Iraq just because Omarosa told him to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen Bush's latest attack ad against Kerry? Take a look.&quot; &quot;Bush&quot; ad: &quot;President Bush supports a constitutional amendment that would prohibit same-sex marriages. And while John Kerry has never publicly supported gay marriages, last week in his home state of Massachusetts, he secretly married Howard Dean. Reelect George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today they're already calling&quot; Shrek 2 &quot;the most famous modern fairy tale since that whole 'Iraq has weapons of mass destruction' thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about last night's show, and I don't like to do this, but looking back on last night night's show, I think the problem was with last night's show, tell me what you think here. I think the only problem with last night's show is I didn't have an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw President Bush's explanation speech last night about Iraq? How many of you? I think it was on about 8:00 last night and some television outlets carried it. CBS did not carry President Bush's address last night. The network feels that the war in Iraq is important; however, not as important as the season finale of 'Yes, dear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush has promised Iraq, listen to this, and I think this is important. He is going to establish elections there in Iraq. He is going to rebuild the infrastructure. He is going to create jobs. And he said if it works there, he'll try it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, Bush announced he has a five-point strategy for getting out of Iraq. I jotted them down. Five-point strategy for getting out of Iraq. Points six through ten will be handled by the Kerry Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that by June 30th, the Iraqis will be able to govern themselves. That's what he said. Yeah, not only that -- President Bush said that by June 30th, he'll be able to pronounce 'Abu Ghraib.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shrek 2 made more than $128 million in its first week. Yeah. In a related story, John Kerry asked Shrek to marry him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General John Ashcroft said today, al Qaeda is determined to attack the United States sometime this summer. He said the terrorists may do it to try and influence our presidential election. So al Qaeda is basically like Ralph Nader, only with more followers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashcroft went on to say that our way of life is being threatened by a group of radical religious fanatics who are armed and dangerous. Then he called for prayers in the schools and an end to gun control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI is also warning suicide bombers may try to disguise themselves as pregnant women. So, if you see a pregnant woman with a beard and mustache, notify authorities immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the FBI asked the public for help in finding seven suspected terrorists. They showed their pictures today, and they set up a special phone line for tips. They got millions of calls today. The only trouble? Everyone who called in asked for either Diana or Fantasia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven Iraqi men who had their hands cut off under Saddam Hussein were recently brought to the United States and fitted with high-tech prosthetic hands. ... The first thing they did with the new hands? Throw rocks at the US Embassy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has called for the tearing down of Abu Ghraib prison and replacing it with one that is easier to pronounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he mentioned it in his speech the other night.&quot; Bush video: &quot;Under the dictator, prisons like Abu Ga - raib.&quot; Leno: &quot;See if the navy guys are laughing at the boss. Yeah, it's real tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's amazing about president bush's speech the other night? The speech was carried by the cable news networks but not by the major networks. ... See, that's when a president knows he's in trouble, okay? When he gives a major speech, and it goes straight to cable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It now turns out there was so much sexual misconduct at that Iraqi prison that the commander may be transferred to a new parish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On May 23rd, 2004, President George Bush fell off his bicycle, and hurt himself. Vote Lance Armstrong for president. He knows how to ride a bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Bush administration now warning us to watch out for radical extremists. And that's just Rumsfeld and Ashcroft. That's not even counting the terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you all saw the picture of those seven terrorists that we're looking for. In fact, one of those terrorists is right here, is from Orange County. That's true. Or as they call him in al Qaeda, Ahmed from the OC, from the OC.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that radical Muslim cleric? Abu Hamza? Something like that. This guy they captured in London this week. I don't know what his name is. Whatever it is. Look at this picture. Look at this guy. He's got one eye and a hook. What is he, like, one of the pirates of the Caribbean now? ARGH, MATEY, AYI!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush announced that the Abu Ghraib prison will be closed. Well, another place Bush has put out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this election's shaping up great. Our choices are a guy who always has second thoughts or a guy who's never had a first thought. I don't know where to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush announced he's going to meet with Pope John Paul when he goes to Italy next week. I don't think President Bush really understands Catholicism. Like he said he was looking forward to meeting the pope's wife, Mrs. Paul, because he likes her fish sticks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Bill Clinton now apartment-hunting in New York City. He says he wants either a two-story or a three-story apartment. You know, Clinton, the more stories the better, really.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You remember Saddam Hussein, they pulled him out of a monkey hole over there in Iraq. And then they locked him up and they've been interrogating him, trying to get valuable information. Well, apparently, surprise, he's not cooperating. And interrogators say he has not been talking and that he seems to be obsessed with hygiene and careful food preparation. And it's, oh no, wait a minute, that's Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest reports, bullets are getting scarce in Iraq. We're actually running out of bullets.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush was in France for the anniversary of D-Day. See, I'm not quite sure he gets it. Like, he says he wants to make sure we don't forget everyone who also helped out on A-Day, B-Day, and C- Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new survey, CNN says that 47% of the people they interviewed did not know that America fought the Germans on D-Day. You know what you call those people? The French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a sad note, as you know, we all lost President Reagan this past weekend. That was a big, big loss. See, you've got to give Reagan credit. He was able to defeat his evil empire without invading it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was fortunate enough to meet President Reagan. You know, I did the White House correspondents' dinner once, back in the 1980s. I got to sit next to the President, had dinner with him. And he's a very funny man. I know he's a great comic. He had a great sense of humor. He told me a very funny story. He asked me, 'Jay, what kind of student were you?' You know, he was talking about school. And he said, 'You know, Jay, I was not a very good student.' He said, 'I was only a C-plus student.' He said, 'You know, Jay, if I'd only applied myself, how much further I could have gone in life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has a new 757 jet he's using while campaigning for President. Pretty high-tech. A lot of safety features. For example, in the event that John Kerry should start speaking, oxygen masks will fall from the ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend President Bush met with the Pope in Rome. Did you see the picture of the two of them together? Man, that poor guy, I mean, he has, that blank look on his face, and like he does not know where he is. And then the Pope told him, 'Well, just be quiet and relax, and it will be fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Actually, do you know this? Do you know the real reason he was forced to step down? Apparently, the Bush Administration was upset because Tenet didn't see this Jennifer Lopez wedding coming. Nobody had any idea.?</SPAN></P>

He ran up a $129,000 bill at Scores strip club in New York City. He's now complaining that that's too much money. You know, at what point did it dawn on this guy?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

And remember during the winter, they pulled him out, he was living in a hole, had himself a hole. Like a month- to-month rental, he had a hole and the troops caught him and yanked him out of the hole and they have been interrogating him ever since. Listen to this, they can't get anything on him. There is no evidence. Prosecutors are having a difficult time building a case against Saddam Hussein. Isn't that amazing when you think about it? They can't build a case against Saddam Hussein. Well, I'll tell you something. The guy was smart. He was very smart, because when he tortured people, he didn't take snapshots.?</SPAN></P>

I mean, on TV, it's really nice. And I tell you, as I watch -- as I watch the retrospective of his career all week, I'm thinking, probably the most famous thing that President Reagan ever said was to Mikhail Gorbachev. Remember he looked in the camera and said, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.' And I was trying to imagine how the candidates of today would have dealt with the Berlin Wall, you know? Like Ralph Nader. Now, he probably would have worried about the environmental impact of tearing down the wall.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry would have just shortened the wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush would have said, 'Wall? What wall?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush was in Normandy last weekend to mark D-day. President Bush said he was so impressed with what he saw, he announced today he wants to send more troops to Normandy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft told Congress they shouldn't be asking him about the legality of what we're doing in Iraq until the war is over. Isn't that amazing? He said, 'You shouldn't question what we're doing until the war is over.' And there's precedent for that. I think it was called the Nuremberg Trials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, CIA Director George Tenet resigned last week. Here's the sad part - the FBI just found out today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The City of Los Angeles now considering moving a small cross from the city's official seal after being threatened by the ACLU with a lawsuit. It seems the small cross will be removed from the official seal of Los Angeles and be replaced with something more appropriate -- a tiny breast implant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Saddam Hussein, remember like last winter, Saddam Hussein, that evil crazy dictator, just nuts, and then he was living in a hole, he remembered a hole somewhere in Tikrit. Nice hole, like a two bedroom hole. No, it was a studio. So they pulled him out of the hole and they've been interrogating him ever since. And they say that he now, Saddam Hussein himself is very involved in his own defense. Isn't that amazing? Very involved in his own defense. You know what that means, a year from now he'll be in Florida playing golf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush met with the new Iraqi president, and this new Iraqi president, he's just an interim guy and he will serve until a permanent figure can be chosen. It's like being married to Jennifer Lopez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Ashcroft in a recent interview said that President Bush is against torture. President Bush is against torture, except of course when it involves the English language!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week in Baghdad, four men were arrested for pretending to be journalists. They pretended to be journalists. And believe me, this has got all the reporters at Fox News really worried. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is meeting with the G8 leaders all this week in Georgia. When they asked President Bush about his thoughts about the G8, Bush said, 'You know, I still like regular tomato juice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we said good-bye to Ronald Reagan. A beautiful funeral. You saw it on TV. You know, when you think about Reagan, he really did the impossible. He brought honor to two dishonorable professions, politics and show business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry suspended his campaign for five days this week for President Reagan's funeral, which I thought was very nice. He didn't do photo ops, didn't give any speeches, and now, right now he's ahead of President Bush in the polls. How does that make him feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching the news all day and the ceremonies and services for President Reagan. ... I'm wondering whether it will be that way for future presidents. Like, years from now like President Clinton's funeral, you know what I'm saying? Hundreds of women throwing themselves on the casket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really don't have leaders who speak as well as Ronald Reagan anymore. He had that simple, direct way of telling something. Like when he called the Soviet Union the evil empire. It was clear and direct. Imagine Bush trying to say that, 'evil empire?' You know he'd screw that up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Bush would say we have to defeat the 'medieval vampire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Miami, an airline passenger was arrested after she slapped, slapped the Air Marshal when he asked her to sit down and turn off her cell phone while the plane was moving. She said it would have been rude to cut off her call in the middle of the conversation. That's so much less rude than slapping a United States Air Marshal!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week in 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts, the first so-called witch was hanged. She was convicted under the original Patriot Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is &quot;going to turn over control of Iraq on June 30th, and if it works there, then in November he's going to do it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britney Spears &quot;was shooting a music video and during the music video she injured her knee. ... But don't worry, she went to the best surgeon in the country. I believe it's the same guy who worked on Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has Saddam Hussein's gun. ... President Bush has that now in his desk at the White House. But of course he's not the first president to hide a piece in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of respect to Ronald Reagan, John Kerry, did you know this? John Kerry suspended his presidential campaign for the week. True. Yeah, unfortunately for Kerry, no one could tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC announced that during the summer Olympics, they're going to set a new record by airing over 1,200 hours of coverage. 1,200 hours. 1,200 hours, yeah. Which is amazing, 'cause that's ten hours longer than the coverage of Reagan's funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After another week of violence in Saudi Arabia, the Bush Administration has warned the Saudis they need to do more in the war against terror. Like for example, fight on our side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Bush meant with Iraq's interim president. See, Bush figured this would be a good time to meet with him, while he's still alive.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book about Saddam Hussein written by his former doctor, after Saddam Hussein's son, Uday, killed one of his servants, Saddam Hussein punished him by setting fire to his car collection. Set his car collection on fire. What an animal this guy is!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel sorry for the next leader of Iraq. You know, especially when he has to try and keep his citizens in line, 'cause you know he's not gonna be as tough as last one. You know what I'm saying? 'Cause you're really just the substitute teacher of Iraq now, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the Motion Picture Association of America, Jack Valenti, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee that many of the criminals who make counterfeit copies of movies, you know, are also terrorists. He said they counterfeit movies to raise money for terrorism. See, that's why Hollywood keeps making films like Gigli and the Alamo. They're trying to put these terrorists out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Bush Administration starts testing a new program called the registered travelers program. This allows people to avoid the long security lines and the checkpoints at airports by paying an extra fee and agreeing to a background check. Boy, that's a great idea, huh? A separate line for rich people. I'm surprised the Republicans thought of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush welcomed Bill and Hillary Clinton back to the White House today for the unveiling of Bill Clinton's official portrait that will hang in the White House. There are two firsts involved. It's the first presidential portrait ever painted by an African-American artist, and it's the first presidential portrait to feature full-frontal nudity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also did an official portrait of Hillary, and to keep it realistic, that will hang in a separate room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One embarrassing moment when President Bush tried to unveil a painting of Al Gore. Turns out, it was the real Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Bush celebrated his 80th birthday over the weekend by doing parachute jump from this airplane. He said he did it to prove that 80-year-olds can do fun and interesting things. You know, I think Hugh Hefner already proved that, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is asking the judge for new trial, because one of the witnesses was accused of perjury. She claims the prosecution knew about it during the trial, which is kind of ironic. Martha Stewart is now accusing the government of having inside information and lying about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court now has preserved the use of the word God in the Pledge of Allegiance. But now, this next part makes no sense to me, they also for some reason changed the word 'flag' to 'monkey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folk have seen the big blockbuster cartoon Shrek 2? It's the most successful animated film ever. Give you an idea how popular it is, President Bush keeps asking to meet him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's father, I thought this was fascinating, turned 80 years old and to celebrate he jumps out of an airplane. And you if you'd seen the polls you know he's not the only Bush in free fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department releases a memo saying that terrorism has gone down. And so turns out that the only reason they released that statement was because of a mathematical error. Apparently terrorism hasn't gone down at all. I thought, 'Oh, my God, mathematical error, isn't that how President Bush became president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already, they've had orders for 1.5 million copies of the Bill Clinton memoir. That's stunning, isn't it? Hasn't eve than been published yes, orders of 1.5 million. In fact, it already in its third printing. That's right, the first two were stained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush, the older one, parachuted with an Army Ranger holding him so he wouldn't get hurt. This is for his 80th birthday. This is the same method they use when his son rides a bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh and his wife are divorcing, and experts say this could get ugly. It could get ugly. I'm confused. Are they splitting up or having sex?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton's &quot;portrait was so lifelike that Hillary threw her drink in its face.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something scary. ... Yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the FBI has arrested a Somalian man involved in an al Qaeda plot to blow up a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. Isn't that frightening? I'll tell you, I sleep better at night knowing that our mall security guards are among the best trained, best equipped killing machines in this country, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something -- these shopping malls are not taking this threat lightly. Today, pottery barn raised their terror warning code to magenta. And it could go to teal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, people are now criticizing the FBI and the CIA for failing to work together despite the fact that they're on the same team. You know what we call that in LA? The Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching the news this afternoon, and one of the channels, they had this legal expert on.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit from an atheist who wanted the words 'under God' removed from the pledge of allegiance. And today, in a related story, Jennifer Lopez asked the Supreme Court to remove 'til death do us part' from the marriage ceremony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at the White House they unveiled the official portrait of former President Bill Clinton. It's very classy. ... It's on black velvet. It's beautiful. ... They had it today at a gas station over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was one embarrassing moment today when they found the portrait on top of the picture of Dolly Madison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States Senators...released their financial disclosure forms showing their net worth and the assets and everything they have. My favorite is the Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist. He's a cardiologist. He's a heart doctor. But his family's money is invested in Krispy Kreme donuts and Wendy's. How smart is this guy? He generates both profits and customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm sure you know over the weekend former President George Bush marked his 80th birthday by jumping out of a plane. In a related story, OJ Simpson marked the tenth anniversary of the murders by jumping out of the bushes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. Rush Limbaugh and his third wife have broken up. ... Apparently, she came home early, caught him in bed with their pharmacist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under their prenuptial agreement, she'll get the car, the house, the investments, and he gets everything in the medicine cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Rumsfeld &quot;says the White House sees no wiggle room...in the definition of torture. I don't think the White House has had a wiggle room since Clinton left.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's official portrait was unveiled yesterday at the White House. ... Yeah, well, don't get too excited because already there's trouble. Clinton's portrait was hitting on the Dolly Madison portrait.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of June they're return turning Iraq over to somebody else. And the new Iraqi government says they want custody of Saddam Hussein. ... You know of what means -- there will be another videotaped flea check.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Agriculture has classified batter-coated frozen French fries as fresh vegetables. And Saudi Arabia is our ally in the war against terrorism. Same kind of thinking, basically.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton's autobiography comes out next week. Odd title. It's called 'Moby Dick.' ... Call my Ishmael.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton talks about infidelity on '60 Minutes' this Sunday. Sixty minutes? Is that enough time. Shouldn't it be on '48 Hours'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's supposed to be very good. In the upcoming interview, Clinton discussed his impeachment process. Clinton says, 'I stood up to it, and I beat it back.' I'm sorry. That's Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said he had the affair with Monica Lewinsky because he could. Ironically, that's the same reason Bush gave for invading Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's exact quote was, 'I did something for the worst possible reason -- just because I could.' What was he going to say? 'I had no choice. She outweighed me. I was pinned down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 9/11 commission said today they have found no ties between al Qaeda and Iraq. There are no ties between al Qaeda and Iraq, to which President Bush said, 'Yeah? What about the fact they're both in the Middle East?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what today is? Today's the 32nd anniversary of the Watergate break-in. ... To give you an idea of how long ago that was -- back then, the Democrats actually had some ideas worth stealing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John Kerry has been interviewing possible vice presidential candidates. It's not an easy process, being Kerry's vice presidential nominee. Each candidate is expected to have at least two answers to every question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 9/11 commission report is in, and this is surprising. They found no link between al-Qaeda and last night's audience. ... The 9/11 commission also found no connection between Liza Minelli and her husband. ... No connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Oh, sure they ran into each other at a few industry functions, but that was it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bill Clinton's autobiography is coming out next week&quot; and &quot;Clinton is going on one of those book tours. He'll be in bookstores in New York City on Tuesday, and they are expecting huge crowds. So can you go and have him sign, but it's going to be crowded...so to keep the line moving, he'll only sign one breast.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was asked today if he's going to see the controversial new movie that's critical of his presidency, and Bush said, 'You know, I'm not really a 'Garfield' fan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 9/11 Commission says this week they found no working relationship between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Kind of like the FBI and the CIA. No working relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Florida, Federal law enforcement officials there tested their readiness to respond to a crisis. A crisis in Florida. You know, like John Kerry starting to pull ahead on election day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw one of the Democratic leaders on cable TV today. He said Kerry is looking for a running mate who would look good standing next to Dick Cheney at a debate. Well, there's a high standard. I think one of those dead bodies from 'CSI' could do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, rumors have restarted that the Republican ticket might not be Bush and Cheney. Did you hear that? Yeah. But today, those rumors were put to rest when Dick Cheney said, 'No, I'm keeping him on the ticket.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know, the summer of Bill Clinton has started. That's what they're calling Clinton's book tour. 'The summer of Clinton.' You know, as opposed to 'The winter of Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, 1,000 people in New York City, 1,000 people heard Bill Clinton compare his impeachment to the Berlin Wall coming down. ... Is that a good analogy? I mean, I can't imagine Ronald Reagan turning to Clinton and saying, 'Mr. Clinton, tear off those pants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton said in an interview that will air on 60 Minutes on Sunday, that he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky because he could. That's what he said. That's what he said. Then he said he was with Paula Jones 'cause he lost a bet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton also said, for a time he felt embarrassed and ashamed. You know, like that feeling we get after you watch Paris and Nicole on 'The Simple Life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton also told Dan Rather that his infidelity almost ruined his marriage, and that he and Hillary received counseling. Now, wasn't Bill Clinton's counselor Jesse Jackson? I think I see part of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in the Sunday Express of London, that's a big Sunday paper over there in England. Janet Jackson said, she really said this, that the entire Super Bowl incident was the result of a plot by conservative forces to distract people from what's really going on in the world. Yeah, yeah. It was a vast right breast conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that unbelievable? Conspiracy. Yeah. Even Hillary's going, 'Shut up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publishers called him in, and they handed former President Clinton the first official copy of his new book, and from force of habit he helped it out of its jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday on 60 Minutes, former President Clinton discusses his problem with infidelity. Yeah, yeah. At one point Clinton says 'It's a shame you guys only have 60 minutes. It should be on '48 hours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore, I don't know if you guys know Mr. Controversy. His film got an R rating for its graphic footage. But to be fair, it does show a couple of close-ups of Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is first day of summer. It was also it was also the longest day of the year. Unless you're Hillary Clinton watching 60 Minutes, then yesterday was the longest day of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love when Clinton told Dan Rather that the worst day of his life was the day he told Hillary the truth. Well, he's not going to do that again, I tell you that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I love? When Dan Rather in the interview compared Bill Clinton's life story to the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. Ulysses S. Grant? I think Hugh Grant would be more like it, wouldn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the book, Dan Rather said that after the scandal broke, Clinton met regularly with three ministers. Three. See, that's when a guy knows he's sinned a lot, okay? When the first minister says, 'Wait, I need back up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton said that after the scandal broke, he slept on the couch for two months. Do you believe that? He slept on the couch? Well, it must be true, because, as you know, the White House is a one-bedroom, two- bath Cape Cod.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I was watching President Clinton tell his story last night, a promo came on the screen that said, 'Stay tuned for Cold Case,' which I thought was an interview with Hillary.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you missed it, we've condensed it down to about 30 seconds. Here's everything you need to know in about 30 seconds.&quot; Former President Clinton: &quot;I did a bad thing. ... I don't see it as a great stain. ... And it was a big dose to swallow.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt sorry for President Bush. You know, he missed Father's Day yesterday. See, according to the intelligence he received, Father's Day is next Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some good news today for President Bush. According to a poll just released, President Bush's poll numbers went from 44% to 50% because of Ronald Reagan's funeral. Ronald Reagan's funeral brought Bush's numbers up. I tell you, if this is a close election in November, and I'm Gerald Ford, I'm gonna start worrying a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You thought the Reagan funeral helped the Bush campaign, wait till the bin Laden funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq's interim government now says they're considering imposing martial law. Well, you can't blame them. I mean, they tried democracy, what, almost two weeks now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain was out campaigning with President Bush over the weekend. The White House said they're doing it, because they're on the same team. You know, kinda the way Shaq and Kobe are on the same team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has called for an increase in the minimum wage. He said people out there are struggling, and you can't always fix the problem by marrying a rich woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Northwest Airlines announced their new slogan today, 'Where the hell are we?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Northwest Airlines flight landed at the wrong airport in South Dakota. How many airports are there in South Dakota? How do you land at the wrong one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plane landed at an Air Force base miles away by mistake. You know, it was bad enough when they were just losing our luggage. Now they can't find the plane either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the pilots didn't even realize they landed at an Air Force base until they got off the plane and couldn't find the sky bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks in town early for the Republican convention? You know, New York City is getting ready for the Republican convention. By the way, I think this is the perfect city to kick off a crooked election, don't you, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But tomorrow is a big day. Bill Clinton's autobiography, his memoir is being published. It's 900 pages long. Listen to this, it's actually longer than the last Harry Potter book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And both of them, I believe, are stories about a boy and his wand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, 1,000 people lined up at Barnes and Nobles to see Bill Clinton. Did you see that? Not to buy his book, but to give him a Father's Day card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's new book is the first presidential memoir in history to contain the words 'all up in there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Killborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton says getting caught cheating helped him achieve a new legal of intimacy with Hillary. Has this guy ever told the truth?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Northwest pilot, while trying to land at an airport in South Dakota, got confused and landed at an Air Force base instead. Didn't even know he was at the wrong airport. Well, good to see our homeland security thing is up and running, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know Bill Clinton's autobiography came out today. And I understand it's based on a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say there's going to be a lot of competition to see whether Bill Clinton's book, 'My Life,' outsells Hillary's book, 'A Living History,' which came out last year. Competition. I hope this doesn't cause any tension in the Clinton marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Clinton was on 60 Minutes on Sunday. And yesterday he was on Elimidate, which, really, I was surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love when Bill Clinton told Dan Rather the worst day of his life was the day he told Hillary the truth. Well, of course it was. The first time you try anything, it's always going to be tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton told Dan Rather that after a sleepless night, he went into Hillary's bedroom, sat on the edge of the bed, and told her about Monica. Actually, Hillary was relieved. When she woke up and saw Bill sitting on the edge of the bed, she thought, 'Oh, he wants to have sex.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for in this whole thing? The women Clinton had sex with this past weekend, because it's too late for them to make it into the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Bill Clinton was on Oprah talking about the book. I guess tomorrow he's on Maury Povich doing one of those paternity test shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In two days, he's been on 60 Minutes, he's been on Oprah, he's been on Larry King. The only thing he hasn't been on lately? Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Bill Clinton's book, Clinton didn't overcome his fear of riding a bicycle without training wheels until he became a college student at oxford. He had training wheels in college. You know, I didn't think Clinton was afraid to ride anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is it about presidents and presidential candidates and bicycles that they can't overcome? Kerry fell off his bicycle. Remember, Bush hit a tree with his. Clinton needs training wheels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that the United States will make sure Saddam Hussein stands trial after we hand over control of Iraq at the end of the month. He said he will make sure Saddam does not take advantage of the Iraqi justice system and get away with murder. You know, the way famous people do over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the approved interrogation techniques one of the approved ones used against the prisoners in Iraq was sound deprivation isolation. The prisoner is isolated all alone in a soundproof booth. Don't we do that on game shows here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has finally picked a running mate. Why? It's a guarantee he gets at least two votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He picked a man by the name of Peter Camejo from the Green Party. And this guy has all the qualifications Ralph Nader was looking for in a candidate. He said yes, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Senate race in Illinois, the Republican candidate, a guy named Jack Ryan, just went through this ugly divorce. And in the court papers, his wife accused him of taking her to sex clubs, where he tried to make her have sex with him in front of strangers. Now, aren't the Republicans the family values people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, Democrats, they cheat on their wives. Republicans cheat, too, but they bring their wife along. They make it a family event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Oregon, a doctor had sex with his patient and then charged the state $5,000 for the session. Got sent to prison for two months. Oh, great. Now taxpayers are paying for him to have sex again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the book stores yesterday, it was a great day for Bill Clinton. They published the book and he sold 1,500 books at a book signing, and got six phone numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the last time Clinton did a media blitz like this, it was to deny all the the stuff that's in his book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm getting closer and closer in line to the former president, and just as it's my turn for Clinton to sign my book, darn the look, he takes a sex break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds of people, hundreds, waited outside the Barnes &amp; Noble in the pouring rain for a chance to meet Bill Clinton. Yeah, when asked if she minded the rain, one woman said, 'I'm meeting Bill Clinton. I just assumed my dress would get ruined.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey asked former President Clinton if he had talked to Monica Lewinsky since their affair. Yeah. Clinton responded, 'Are you kidding? I didn't talk to her during the affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say by picking Peter Camejo, Nader is guaranteed to win the vote of Peter Camejo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just read Bill Clinton's book. Hundreds of affairs, thousands of lies, lawsuits, and then I got to subpoenas, and then I got to page 2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say Bill Clinton's book could earn $100 million. Hillary wants to burn it. George Bush wants to color it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of people waited in line to get an autographed copy of Clinton's book. There was pushing, there was shoving and there was groping. And that's just when Bill signs your book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has only been out for a day, Bill Clinton's book, and it is already like number one on the New York Times best seller list. The book is called, 'My Life - As A Dog.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, 'My Life' was not the original title of the book. The original title did not test well with focus groups. In fact, this is a very early copy. This is the original title of the book: 'First You Weigh'em, Then You Lay'em.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the back cover, there is a picture of Bill Clinton at his desk in the Oval Office, and his face is framed between a bust of Harry Truman and a bust of FDR. Because, if there is one thing you know about Bill Clinton, he is always happiest when his face is between two busts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton claims he lead a double life. He really says this. He was kind of like a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde the Salami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton also revealed one night, when he was like 5 or 6 years old, back in Arkansas, his step dad fired a gun in the house, but it didn't hit him or his mother. So it looks like this bad aim thing really runs in the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most quoted thing in the book is where Clinton talked about after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, he slept on the couch for two months. Two months on the couch. See, that's how you know Hillary was mad, okay? They had separate bedrooms. She still made him sleep on the couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Monica Lewinsky was not sympathetic at all. Did you hear her today? She said, 'Hey, if Bill thought the couch was uncomfortable, try getting under that little desk!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like every political journalist is picking John Edwards as the number one choice to be John Kerry's vice president. Imagine the debate between Dick Cheney and a trial lawyer like Edwards? One guy spent his career in an ambulance, the other guy spent his career chasing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why I told that joke? 'Cause I could. And I'm going to tell you, that -- that was -- that was the worst reason for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Northeast Airlines flight landed at the wrong airport in South Dakota this week. President Bush said today he had a similar experience. He was flying to the National Guard facility in Alabama and the plane landed in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader announced his vice presidential running mate for the election. In a related story, a tree fell in a forest and no one was there to hear it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This having a book and being on tour, and that's a lot of pressure on the guy. He has been running late. His whole schedule has been running late. As a matter of fact, he was running so far behind yesterday, he had to cancel his 3:00 intern.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book was already 30% off. Just like his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton revealed that for two months while he was president, he slept on the couch. That's what he said, yeah. Clinton also revealed that his nickname for Monica was 'The Couch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a brand-new interview, Star Trek's Jeri Ryan -- very sexy woman. -- claims that her ex-husband, who's running for the US Senate, tried to get her to have sex in public places. Yeah. When asked why he did this, her ex-husband said 'Cause I was married to Jeri Ryan!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know my new lady friend, I'll be honest with you. She's very, very dirty, she's very kinky. And last night we were in bed and she demanded that I read to her from the new Clinton book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early reviews for the new Michael Moore film are in. OK, it got two thumbs up from Ebert and Saddam.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continues to be President Clinton's best-selling book. On the news, they interviewed Clinton's editor. Editor? The book is 957 pages long. What the hell did he edit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book is huge. You know it actually folds out into a bed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post reported today that President Clinton feels he has two more autobiographies to write. That's what I love about Clinton. He's the only guy in the world who has three versions of his life story. He's got one for him. One for Hillary. One for the grand jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the book, President Clinton said this is his quote. 'He said in politics, if you don't toot your own horn, it usually stays untooted.' And to get someone else to toot your horn, you get impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He talks about the point when Hillary first started to laugh again. Yeah. He said it happened right when he told her, 'Look, I'll never cheat on you again. I promise.' Apparently, she got hysterical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He told Oprah he went to counseling one full day a week for a year to help him. Not an hour. All day long. That's when you know you have a problem, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you go to counseling and your hour's up and they hold you for another seven hours -- that's not even counseling. You're quarantined. They want you off the streets. Even Tony Soprano only went an hour a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's hear what's going on with Vice President Dick 'Potty-Mouth' Cheney. Did you hear about this? CNN reported on the Senate floor, Dick Cheney flipped out on Senator Patrick Leahy. Told Senator Leahy to go 'F' himself. Aren't these the people trying to fine Howard Stern for bad language?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Ronald Reagan's son, Ron Reagan Jr., has attacked President Bush, saying he made a terrible mistake in Iraq. And President Bush is furious. He says, what does the son of a former president know about Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department announced today they are rewriting the guidelines on torturing prisoners. You know what was wrong the first memo on torture? People found out about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the new US Ambassador to Iraq was sworn in. He was sworn in with his hand on a stack of his dental records. Makes it easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, presidential candidate Ralph Nader named his running mate. He chose Green Party activist Peter Camejo. 'Camejo' is actually an old Spanish word meaning 'no votes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican senatorial candidate, from Illinois, Jack Ryan -- you hear about this? He vowed to stay in the race for Senate, despite embarrassing allegations that he tried to pressure his former wife, Jeri Ryan, to perform public sex acts in nightclubs. I heard about going after the swing voters. But, gee, this is crazy. This seems like the wrong way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's big gay pride parade weekend, gay pride, yeah, sure. And of course the highlight of the week will be when they force a queer makeover on Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saddam Hussein's letter is &quot;kind of pathetic because in the letter, he asks his daughter if he would swing down his spiderhole and water his plants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then Saddam ends up the letter to his family with a, 'P.S. I need another three-pack of underwear.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his book My Life, Bill Clinton &quot;says that he never pays attention to a poll. That's interesting for a politician. Never pay attention to a poll. Unless there is a stripper attached to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton has agreed to sign copies of his book at a Costco Shopper's Warehouse. That's true. He's gonna sign his book at a Costco Shopper's Warehouse. Yeah, Clinton said he loves Costco because he likes to be surrounded by giant cans and big jugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton's book is selling so well, this is true, it's selling so well, that it has boosted sales of Hillary's book. Yeah, apparently, apparently reviewers are calling the two books 'great separate bedroom reading.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Barbara Streisand and Neil Diamond sang together at a fundraiser for John Kerry. Barbara Streisand, Neil Diamond, yeah. As a result, experts say Kerry has a really good shot at winning the 1976 election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over on Capitol Hill, Dick Cheney got in a big argument with Senator Leahy. And Leahy shoots back, 'At least I can do it without having a heart attack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The argument kept going, he used the F-word again and somebody else used the F-word -- I'm sorry, that's Bill Clinton's book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It is TGIF. You happy it's TGIF? Thanks to Dick Cheney, we now know what the 'F' stands for. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the Senate on Tuesday, Vice President Dick Cheney got so mad, so mad at Senator Patrick Leahy, you know, he was criticizing Halliburton, Cheney told Leahy to go 'F' himself. But Leahy said it's okay, he said, 'Cheney was just having a bad day.' Which isn't really true. I mean, a bad day for Dick Cheney is what, like, three heart attacks? That's a bad day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I love how they cover these kinds of things up. Like, a Cheney spokesman said on the news today, he said, 'Yes, the Vice President did talk with Senator Leahy, and they had a frank exchange of views.' Telling someone to 'f' themselves, a frank exchange of views. So, apparently, 'Up Yours' is also medical advice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and the country of Saudi Arabia, they're our good friends. Our allies. They're now offering terrorists amnesty, amnesty, if they turn themselves in. Well, that's cracking down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So, basically, Saudi Arabia is offering terrorists the same program we offer here to people with overdue library books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, we're still planning to hand over power to the Iraqis on June 30th, which is -- you know what this feels like? You ever return a rental car after you beat the crap out of it? 'Here you go. Yeah, good luck. I didn't see any dent in the side. No, I don't know what you're talking about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's some good inside gossip. The other day, John Kerry had a secret meeting with John Edwards in a private hideaway room in the Capitol. But they had to cut it short, because they were both overcome from the hairspray fumes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, you see Monica Lewinsky? Man, was she upset about the way Bill Clinton talked about her in the book. Whoo. For which Hillary said, 'Hey, at least you got mentioned in the book.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this interview Monica gave on British TV? Oh, man. She was really upset. I mean, she gave Clinton a good tongue-lashing. I'll tell you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody reading the book? It's pretty good. It's a pretty good book. Clinton also says in the book that after he told Hillary about the affair, it was the darkest part of his life. Really? How about when he hit on Paula Jones? That had to be pretty dark, huh? That must have been a pitch black day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Clinton told Oprah Winfrey the other day that Hillary was more angry with Ken Starr than she was with him. See, only in politics would the wife be more angry at Ken Starr. See, in real life the wife would have cooperated with Ken Starr, and then tried to run over her husband with a Mercedes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The government is now proposing replacing food stamps with a credit card to try and eliminate the stigma of the stamps. A food stamp credit card. Don't we have that already? Isn't that called 'The Discover Card?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commerce Department now touting positive job numbers. Over a million jobs have been created in the last three months. But most of those jobs are for lower-paid workers, or, as Wal-Mart calls them, women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about that super baby that was born in Germany? I guess the kid was born with abnormally large muscles. The kid's only a couple of months old, can lift seven pounds in one hand. Unbelievable. And already, Republicans are grooming him to be the next governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City doormen, apartment building doormen, you know what I'm talking about. They're now receiving anti-terrorism training. The doormen. These guys are going to stop a terrorist attack? They can't even stop the guy who keeps leaving the takeout menus under your door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Bill Clinton's book &quot;has sold about nine billion copies and Bubba is out signing books, he is on his book signing tour. Don't kid yourself wherever you go, the security will be very, very tight. You know, be prepared to be frisked. It's going to happen. You are going to be patted down and you're going to be strip searched and that's just by Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on Larry King, former President Clinton said he's been married to Hillary for so long, he can just look at her and tell what she's thinking. Yeah, and usually she's thinking, 'You son of a bitch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in the Senate -- you probably heard about this -- Vice President Dick Cheney got angry, really angry, at a senator and used the 'F' word. Yeah, yeah. Not surprisingly, the 'F' word for Cheney is 'fibrillate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about the controversial movie, 'Fahrenheit 9-11?' I hope George Bush is not too angry about this film. No one wants to see Michael Moore in 'naked pyramid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's going to be another new movie that points out the flaws in the Clinton Administration. It's called 'White Chicks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Bill Clinton, did you hear Bill sign a deal to write two more books? He's going to write two more books. How many girls did this guy boff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton said his affair with Monica Lewinsky brought he and Hillary closer together. In fact, last night in bed, Bill and Hillary actually shook hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the show. You folks seem like a great group.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to talk about people when they are not here, but the audience Friday night. I'm telling you, nasty bunch, listen how bad they were. Halfway through the show, Dick Cheney jumps up and starts screaming obscenities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an historic day. As you know, the US has handed over sovereignty of Iraq to Iraq and it took place two days early. And the people who were there say it is the most touching handover they've ever seen since I was handed over by NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks were in town yesterday saw the big gay pride parade? I want to tell you, it was refreshing and exciting to see a pyramid of naked men that was not a violation of the Geneva Convention, wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hookers and strippers are flying in from all over the world for the Republican convention. Well, you know, Bush said he was going to create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book all about the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il...this guy is apparently just a whack job. He enjoys eating the feet of camels. He drinks a half million dollars worth of wine every year. And he loves to abduct actresses. It is like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you think that Kim Jong Il is bad, you should meet his father, Mental Li Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, my lady friend started talking dirty to me in bed. And I said, where did you learn to talk filthy? And she said, Vice President Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, George Bush handed over power to the Iraqis. Did you hear about that? Then they asked George Bush where he's going now and he said, 'I'm invading Disneyland!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was kind of nice, wished the Iraqis God's grace on their road to democracy. And Dick Cheney told them all to go 'F' themselves.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you one guy who's very excited about the handover. That's President George Bush. He is thrilled about turning the power back over to Iraq. Do you know why? He's thinking about invading them again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican National Convention coming to New York City, will be here the end of August, and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will be speaking at the Republican conventions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein about to face trial. And George Bush wants him executed. Not because of the war crimes, but because Saddam's beating him in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Dick Cheney went up to Yankee Stadium to a ball game.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone in the stadium boos him. As we know, Dick Cheney has a horrible temper, so he goes crazy and he grabs everybody who booed him and then ran them around naked on a leash.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Thursday, Saddam and 11 of his henchmen will be arraigned for war crime, and I believe this will be the first time that they've all been together since Chemical Ali's skating party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to interrogators, Saddam Hussein is arrogant, he's defiant, he thinks that people are still in love with him. He thinks that he's still very popular. He thinks that he is still president. No, wait a minute, that's Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did anybody see Saddam Hussein in his court appearance? I gotta say one thing for Saddam Hussein, he really cleaned up great, didn't he? I mean, he looked fantastic. They went over him for four hours with the turbo nose hair trimmers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legally, it is fascinating, because they bring Saddam Hussein into court, and they present him with a list of charges against him, and he refuses to sign them. So, I guess the whole thing's off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on a hot day -- what was it, 91, 92 degrees today? I was sweating like President Bush watching Fahrenheit 9/11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's one controversial scene where for seven minutes on the morning of September 11th they show President Bush sitting in an elementary school in Florida. He doesn't get up, he just sits there and he reads the children's book, and Michael Moore thinks this makes Bush look bad, showing him unprepared to deal with a crisis. See, I think it makes Bush look good. Did you know he could read a children's book in seven minutes?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post this morning published an edition where they wrote that Kerry chose Dick Gephardt. They had it on the front page. Apparently, the post blamed their new researcher, Jayson Blair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Kerry was thinking of going with Gephardt but then at the last minute decided to go with someone who had eyebrows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so dramatic how they chose Edwards. Did you see it this morning? I'll tell you. On the news, when they showed Kerry giving Edwards that final rose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then when they showed poor Dick Gephardt crying on the limo ride home, oh man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John Edwards is a former trial lawyer, which is a smart move, considering the last election was decided in court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love it when John Kerry said, 'I can't tell you how proud I am, how proud I am to have John Edwards on my team. Especially after John McCain turned me down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political strategists -- you know, this is interesting. They thought Kerry was going to choose an older, more financially successful running mate. You know, like when he picked his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards earned a fortune from medical malpractice suits. He and Dick Cheney have something in common. They both know what it's like to chase down an ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attacks have started already, John Edwards is too inexperienced to be president, he's too flashy, he's not up to the job. I'm sorry, that's what Kerry was saying about him during the primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as Edwards was announced, as soon as he picked him, the Republicans put out a new attack ad calling him unaccomplished. That's what they said. They said he is unaccomplished. He was born poor, he became a multimillionaire. For the Republicans that's the definition of accomplishment, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, last week we turned over sovereignty in Iraq. Well, thank God that's over. Whoo! Don't have to worry about that place anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following Saddam Hussein's trial? You know, they have a mountain of evidence against this guy, tons of evidence. Or as they call that in LA, an acquittal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Israel, scientists have concluded that communist dictator Vladimir Lenin actually died of syphilis. In fact, his last words were, 'Okay, maybe I did have sexual relations with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts, plans to write a children's book, and it's going to be from the point of view of his dog, Splash. You know, I don't want to sound insensitive, but isn't that the worst possible name Ted Kennedy could come up with for his dog?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He named his dog Splash? Isn't that like Bill Clinton naming his dog BJ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to President Bush today. It's President Bush's birthday. Also, Sylvester Stallone's birthday. They are both 58 years old today. Sylvester Stallone and President Bush. But what are the odds that two of the most eloquent masters of the English language would be born on the same day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's already getting nasty. After Kerry selected Edwards, the Republicans immediately denounced Edwards as 'disingenuous.' Disingenuous, yeah. When he heard this, President Bush said, 'I didn't know the guy was a foreigner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney congratulated Edwards and said that he looked forward to a 'spirited campaign.' That's what Dick Cheney said. Yeah. In response, Edwards has hired someone to start his car every morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post made a major mistake. They said Kerry had chosen Dick Gephardt. ... This is not the only major mistake the Post has made recently. Take a look at this headline right here: 'Dick Cheney wins New York marathon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for John Edwards. It's been 24 hours. John Kerry still has not changed his mind. So it's going to hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, because of the tough presidential primaries last year -- remember how nasty they were to each other? There was talk whether there would be a personality conflict between Edwards and Kerry. Fortunately, Kerry does not have a personality, so...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Edwards guy, he's gonna be trouble for the Bush-Cheney ticket. I mean, he's charismatic, and that's going to hurt Cheney. And he can talk, and that's gonna hurt Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to see John Edwards and Dick Cheney debate. Wouldn't that be cool? It'd be like watching Dennis the Menace debating Mr. Wilson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love when Edwards stands next to Kerry. Show the picture. Look at this. Doesn't it look like a before and after botox ad?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, Edwards has got the personality. Edwards has the TV smile, doesn't he? Like, when Edwards smiles, he looks like a game show host. When Kerry smiles, he looks like the guy in the Imodium ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It now turns out that John Kerry is twice as rich as previously thought. Remember, they thought his wife was worth $500 million? Worth $1 billion. Turns out, worth $1 billion. And today, President Bush said, see, this is proof his tax cuts are working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that explains why Kerry chose Edwards. See, Kerry's worth $1 billion, Edwards is worth, what, $50 million? This way, they can represent both the haves and the really haves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now concluded that communist leader Vladimir Lenin, who died in 1924, died from syphilis. They just concluded that. You thought your HMO took a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all been following the trial of Saddam Hussein? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I tell you, in an angry, bitter tirade, Saddam claimed that he is the real president of his country, and he denounced George Bush as nothing more than a criminal. I'm sorry, that was Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, the Bush Administration announced that gas prices have fallen for the sixth week in a row, and we can expect a continued downward trend right through, I don't know, maybe -- election day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today -- the fun facts are coming out -- reported today that John Kerry and his running mate John Edwards are together worth over half a billion dollars. True story. In fact, Kerry and Edwards are so rich, they've decided to vote for the Republicans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Oregon is considering a bill that would make it legal for medical personnel -- medical personnel to possess a pound of marijuana. Yeah, true story. In a related story, Snoop Dogg has enrolled in the Oregon school of nursing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. I'm Jay Leno. You've met my running mate, Kevin Eubanks. As you know, I try to get John McCain for my band leader, but he turned me down.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, our vice presidential choices are - John Edwards versus Dick Cheney. It's the heartthrob versus the heart attack. Pick the one you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats consider this John Kerry/John Edwards the green team, and of course, green teams never lose. Right, Laker fans?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen Kerry and Edwards together? Don't they look a little too friendly? I think the new campaign slogan is, 'Hey, guys, get a room, will ya?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why their wives are right behind them the last few days. They don't want to leave these two guys alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Kerry and Edwards said today they plan on spending over $3 million on their campaign this month, and that's just on hair spray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards, though, he's a young guy. Has a lot of pluses, brings a lot of pluses to the ticket. John Kerry would like to have his charm. President Bush, I think would like to have his communication skills. And Dick Cheney would like to have his heart -- literally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, he is this close to naming a new CIA director because the current CIA Director, George Tenet, left his position as head of the CIA today. On a related story, agents of the CIA said, 'What? Tenet is leaving? What?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day at the White House, President Bush met with the Prime Minister of Iceland. You see? Now, this is where Bush is not good, okay? I don't think he understands a lot about these foreign countries. Like, after the meeting, he thanked the president of Iceland for keeping all of our drinks so cool in the summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the former head of Enron, Ken 'Human Scum' Lay, arrested. Taken to jail in handcuffs. The government, they've charged him with security fraud, bank fraud and stock manipulation, which is pretty much the CEO's trifecta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, some habits die hard. Like when he saw his cell, he asked if he could be upgraded to a suite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Ukrainian man has won that country's super lotto. Not even the regular lotto, super lotto jackpot. Second time in nine months. Experts say it's almost mathematically impossible for one man to be that lucky twice. Which, of course, more bad news for President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists at the Smithsonian Institute have discovered a fossil of a man in Kenya that has a skull 30% smaller than any previous human specimen found. They believe that humans evolved, their heads got bigger and bigger. You know what that means? John Kerry would be the most advanced human on the planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a rock concert in Oslo, Norway, a man and a woman got up on stage, had sex while the band was playing, had sex on stage. They said they did it to bring attention to the plight of the rain forest. You know something? I think Al and Tipper Gore are just starting to lose it. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning that terrorists are planning to strike us. We don't know when, we don't know where, and we don't know how. Well, thanks for clearing that up, guys. Appreciate that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Tom Ridge said that there are credible reports that Al Qaeda is planning to disrupt our presidential elections. Talk about an easy job. Forget Al Qaeda. Palm Beach can do that. Broward County does it every four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, the other big story is Enron. It looks like Martha Stewart's going to have a tennis partner now in prison. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you surely know, yesterday, prosecutors charged Ken Lay with running a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the public, or as we call it, a presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Ken Lay demanding a speedy trial. Well, sure, otherwise he won't get the pardon before Bush leaves office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush had a nickname for Ken Lay. He used to call him 'Kenny Boy.' That's what he called him. 'Kenny Boy'. Of course, that was a while ago. Bush has a new nickname for him now. 'Kenny who?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story in Washington is that the Bush Administration is desperate to find Osama bin Laden before the election. And it looks like they're finally using all their intelligence capabilities in this hunt. In fact, today, they typed his name into Google. So that's a good start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big report was issued today slamming, slamming the CIA for its faulty intelligence gathering before the Iraq war. They say the CIA completely overstated Iraq's capabilities to wage war and they supplied the White House with the wrong information. And today President Bush said, 'Boy, I'm glad I never read those things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Howard Dean debated Ralph Nader. Why? Do they just do it for fun? To stay in practice?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in Dayton, Ohio, with John Kerry, John Edwards said, 'The truth is I'm here for one simple reason -- because I love America.' Really? Is that the reason? How about the reason he is here is because John McCain said, 'No, I'm not interested'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've been listening to John Edwards? He keeps talking about how there are two Americas, one for the rich and one for the poor. Two Americas. Have you looked around? There's just one big fat America. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this America is so fat it's blocking out the other two Americas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry told a crowd of supporters that Edwards is ready for this job. Well, who isn't ready for that job? It's the vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what do you need? A blue suit and a pulse. That's all you need. In fact, listen. Dick Cheney has proved -- you don't even need the pulse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some prominent Republicans, the latest one is Al D'Amato, are urging President Bush to replace Dick Cheney as his running mate. And Cheney is furious. He said they'll replace him over his dead body. The Republican leader said, 'Look, we can't wait till next Thursday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch how these campaigns go, the Republicans now are doing everything they can to try to make President Bush look cooler in the eyes of the public. Like, the new plan now is to have him land on an aircraft carrier wearing a Spider-man costume&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now say -- this is frightening -- there is a new drug-resistant form of syphilis that's already been detected in three different American cities. See, I knew this Clinton book tour was a bad idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tour de France is under way. This could be the sixth time, the sixth time that Lance Armstrong rolls through France and into Paris unopposed. Six times, which is pretty amazing. You know, the Germans could only do it twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night at a Democratic fundraising concert -- true story -- John Kerry played guitar while everyone on stage sang, 'This land is your land.' That's true. Yeah, then Kerry admitted that much of the land is actually his wife's land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, this week, President Bush met the 14-year- old boy who won this year's national spelling bee. Yeah, nice. Yeah, the boy's name is David Tidmarsh, or as Bush calls him, 'Mr. Smarty Know- It-All.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in Esquire magazine, Donald Trump said if he were president, he would've caught Osama a long time ago. That's what he said. Yeah, then somebody explained to Trump that Osama and Omarosa are not the same person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Newsweek, Bush Administration officials are reviewing a proposal that would allow for the postponement of the presidential election in the event of a catastrophe. You know, like John Kerry winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, now the Department of Homeland Security always tells Americans, 'If you don't fly commercial airlines', what? 'The terrorists have won.' 'We don't hold the Super Bowl or World Series,' what happens? 'The terrorists have won.' If we don't go to the mall to do our Christmas shopping, what happens?' 'The terrorists have won.' Come time for the election, 'Oh, let's have the terrorists have that one, go ahead.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City police are now training doormen to be part of the frontline of defense on terrorism. This one is true no, no, this is true. They're teaching doormen to be on the look out for suspicious packages. They're teaching doormen to increase their observational skills, which will prevent terrorists from getting into buildings. Unless, of course, the terrorist is a good tipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards said he was humbled, he was humbled by John Kerry asking him to be his vice presidential running mate. Really? You think that's humbling? You know what's really humbling? When Ralph Nader asks you to be his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching Edwards and Kerry on the campaign trail? These guys have done more hugging in four days than Bill and Hillary did in 26 years, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry is hoping Edwards will bring in a lot of female voters because of the way he looks. But it's interesting, both Cheney and Edwards are going after voters' hearts, it's just that Cheney's looking for one that's a donor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Reagan's son, Ron Reagan Jr., is going to be a featured speaker at the Democratic convention. But President Bush said today he is not worried. He said, 'Hey, who wants to listen to the son of a former president speak at a convention?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says that some of President Bush's military records have been lost and destroyed. That is so unfair. Do you realize he could've been the greatest National Guardsman of all time? Now, we'll never know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After seven years, CIA Director George Tenet officially resigned as of yesterday. Stepped down officially as of yesterday. His final words of advice to the CIA, he told them, 'Hey, keep an eye out for that bin Laden fellow. He could be trouble.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe can you tell from looking at me, I'm a little worried about tonight's show. We have a great show, according to the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry picked his running mate, John Edwards, and Kerry- Edwards, if you think a bit, I have not seen such electricity since Dole- Kemp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry told Tom Ridge, you know, the Director of Homeland Security, he told Tom Ridge that he was too busy to have a briefing on homeland security. That's what John Kerry said, told Tom Ridge, 'I'm too busy.' And I thought that was odd because you're not supposed to ignore terror threats until after you become the president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then last weekend, the New York Post announced that John Kerry had selected Richard Gephardt as his running mate, big front page thing, Richard Gephardt. You know what this has done, it's made me now question some of the items in Cindy Adams' column.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Kerry-Edwards relationship is working better than anybody has expected. As a matter of fact, earlier today, they went to Massachusetts and got married.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, executives from the NAACP tried to meet with President Bush just so they could get the cold shoulder. That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so hot, Bush said today, 'That's it, we may have to cancel the election. That's it. It is too hot!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard this nonsense? They're talking about the possibility of delaying the presidential election in the event of a terrorist attack, which would make the presidential campaign even longer. You know, I got a better idea. How about moving it up? Why don't we just have it next week?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine, though, if they did delay the election. That would mean President Bush would be the longest-serving president never to get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In speeches around the country, President Bush is now talking about his intelligence failures. He said he's enjoying it, makes him feel like he's back in school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry and John Edwards still traveling around the country in their 'big hands across each other tour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz, John Kerry's wife, said on 60 Minutes it was important for her and Elizabeth Edwards to keep their husbands honest. And today Hillary Clinton said, 'Good luck! Let me know how it works out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent poll shows that John Edwards has a higher approval rating than Dick Cheney. That's pretty amazing. For the first time the lawyer is ahead of the guy in the ambulance.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top aide to Osama bin Laden surrendered today. Did you see the pictures? The guy is in a wheelchair. See, that's when you know the war on terrorism is not going that great. When it takes us three years to catch a guy who can't walk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy with no legs. We didn't even catch him. He gave up. He goes, 'I'm sitting here, hello!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Philippines announced they're withdrawing all their troops from Iraq. All 51 of them. Whoo. P. Diddy's got a bigger posse than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, another conservative Republican came out against gay marriage. Ken Lay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See Larry King last night? I love this. What a hypocrite, this guy is. Ken Lay said some of the people that lost money in Enron are still mad at him, but he said he rarely runs into them. Well, duh, that's because he's still rich and they're all poor. That's the whole point of living in a gated community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City is getting ready for the Republican National Convention. I think it's about a month, at the end of August, and President George Bush is very excited to be coming here for the convention because he's absolutely certain when he comes here, he'll have no trouble finding weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you live around Madison Square Garden, don't come out during convention. Stay indoors, because theory is that the Republicans don't really want to mingle with New Yorkers. The Republicans are just here to nominate a President and get laid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the Republicans are in town, they're going to take a visit up to Grant's Tomb to see what a two-term Republican looks like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Merv Griffin gave Nancy Reagan a puppy, and today it was announced that the dog will speak at the Democratic National Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration now, have you heard about this? They may postpone the November election if there is a terrorist attack. If there is a terrorist attack, they may postpone the election or they'll postpone it if there are scattered showers. Either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans say they don't want the terrorists to determine the election. That's what Republicans are saying, we don't want the terrorists to determine election. No, they want the Governor of Florida to determine the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech just the other day, President Bush called marriage between a man and a woman 'the basis of an orderly society.' That's what he said, yeah. Then Bush said, 'Unless the bride is Jennifer Lopez. All bets are off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you guys seen lately John Kerry and John Edwards together? They are touching and groping everywhere. Even the Queer Eye guys are saying get a room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate now debating whether to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage. They want to define marriage now as a sacred union between a man and J-Lo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new world record has been set in the 100 meter dash. It was very exciting. It was set by Filipino troops fleeing Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of Osama bin Laden's chief confidants turned himself in to Saudi Arabian officials yesterday. You see him getting off the plane in Saudi Arabia at the airport? He was in a wheelchair. They said he was suffering from leg injuries. So apparently, they have Southwest Airlines over there, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news, he was confined in a wheelchair due to injuries he sustained 10 years ago while fighting in Bosnia and Chechnya. How is it we know more about this guy's military background than we do our own President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is believed he may know where Osama bin Laden is. Ah! But today, President Bush told him, 'Don't give it away. We want it to be a surprise in November. Keep it a surprise.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida officials announced this week, starting this November, they will allow felons to vote. You thought Bush stole the election before. Now, they're working with the pros.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if other states follow this? You're talking about millions of voters. Is that a good idea? Do you want to create a felons' voting bloc that the candidates have to appeal to? 'If elected, I'll remove 10,000 cops from the street. I will remove all security cameras from 7-11s.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A defiant George Bush said today he intends to serve two terms in the White House -- Al Gore's, and then his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent poll in Newsweek says that if Colin Powell or any other, John McCain, one of those ran with Bush, he would win. But if he sticks with Cheney, he will probably lose. That's what they said. Bush is loyal, so I don't think he'll drop Cheney. But still, do you still think, secretly, Bush is calling Cheney's doctor? 'You told me he would be dead by Thursday. What's going on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Kerry and Edwards? That little honeymoon. Have you been watching those two guys? Tossing that football back and forth. 'Wee!' Throwing the ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's just kind of refreshing to see a Democrat tossing the pig skin instead of fondling it. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic National Committee released its lineup of the politicians that will speak at the convention. And Hillary Clinton is not on the list. Today, Bill told her, 'Don't feel bad.' None of his other women are speaking, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Britney Spears' ex-husband, that Jason Alexander guy, the one she married for like 55 hours? Well, he's now speaking out about the annulment. He said he didn't know what he was signing because his father wasn't in the room when he signed it. Same thing Bush said when he joined the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush has the two twin daughters, and Jenna Bush is moving to New York City. Did you realize that? Yeah. She'll be searching for margaritas of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City is getting ready for the Republican convention, and New Yorkers are being asked to stay home and not go anywhere near Madison Square Garden during the convention. Isn't that odd? They don't want people going anywhere near Madison Square Garden. Gee, I wish we could get the Knicks to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are having their convention up in Boston, and they have announced their convention lineup, and there is the big surprise. They are not going to allow Hillary Clinton to speak before the convention. ... When Bill Clinton heard this, he said, how do you do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in the Senate failed to get enough votes to pass an amendment banning gay marriage. Couldn't get it through. Yeah. Yeah, afterwards Republicans said, 'We're not giving up. If we can't ram it down their throats, we'll get it in through the back door.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that vice presidential candidate John Edwards drinks four diet Cokes every morning. Yeah, when asked why, Edwards said, 'You'd drink that much caffeine if you had to stand next to John Kerry all day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, John Edwards was using John Kerry's head for shade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk now that Vice President Dick Cheney may be dropped from the Republican ticket. Oh, that's a good move. Lose the smart guy. Yes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush daughters, the twins have officially joined the Bush campaign. It was announced today that their Secret Service code names are Twinkie and Turquoise. Who thought these up? That's the best names for the President's daughters? Twinkie -- what are they, strippers now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Bush twins are in the August issue of Vogue magazine and they look beautiful, have these beautiful gowns on, look very, very nice. And the girls said, talking about their father, President Bush is an avid teaser of their boyfriends. President Bush likes to tease their boyfriends when they come over. Yeah. And after he's done teasing them, he has Donald Rumsfeld torture them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on the Today Show, First Lady Laura Bush said that she told her daughters when they're out there on the campaign trail with their father, 'Stand up straight and keep their hair out of the their eyes.' Which is the same thing Kerry told John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry spoke to the NAACP today, and you could tell he was pandering to the crowd. Like, he said the first thing he would do as president was give a full pardon to Whoopi Goldberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry talked about how there are two Americas. He said he knew there were two Americas, 'cause every night he has to drive home from the other America to get home to his America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards made his first solo campaign appearance yesterday in Iowa. ... In fact, it went so well, Edwards is now thinking of dropping Kerry from the ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ralph Nader also made a solo campaign appearance today. Except in Ralph's case, it means he was there by himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Edwards said Vice President Dick Cheney is out of touch with the lives of most Americans. Cheney denied the charge from his underground bunker at an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Howard Dean will be speaking at the Democratic convention. On the first night, they've got Howard speaking first. I guess they're using him to test the sound system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the nation's top election officials said today the United States will not cancel nor postpone the presidential election because of a terrorist attack. He said if there is a problem, the Supreme Court will reappoint President Bush immediately, rather than wait two months like they did last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Republicans in the Senate failed in their attempt to pass a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. They said if the Founding Fathers ever thought gay marriage was even possible they would have banned it in the Constitution. See, I don't know about that. Do you ever see those paintings of the Founding Fathers? The powdered wigs, the frilly shirts, the big leg things there, the stockings? It looks like a party at Elton John's house, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love hearing politicians talk about the sanctity of marriage? You know what we should do? We should let their ex-wives speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mike Ditka, who was thinking of running for the Senate in Illinois, to replace Jack Ryan -- remember Jack Ryan, who dropped out because of the sex scandal? Well, Ditka has decided not to run. And he dismissed reports his wife would divorce him if he ran. That's what he said. He said today, 'She'd do anything I wanted to do.' Which is ironic, 'cause if Jack Ryan's wife had said that, he'd still be running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Environmentalists are now blasting a proposal by the White House to lift a ban on logging in remote areas of the national forests. The Bush Administration said today, 'We have to chop these trees down now, because hey, we might not be here next year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a Federal judge ruled that Congressman Bill Janklow -- remember him? He was convicted for manslaughter for running a stop sign, speeding, and killing a motorcyclist. He is not liable for civil damages because he was on duty at the time. And today, OJ announced he's running for Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do Martha Stewart and President Bush have in common? They're both afraid of a long sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Late Show was nominated for Emmy awards this year, five Emmy awards. ... But we're in kind of an unusual category this year. Tough competition. We're up against the Reagan funeral and Saddam Hussein's flea inspection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now is the keynote speaker lineup for the Democratic national convention, the speakers include Al Gore...Dick Gephardt and Joe Lieberman. Side effects may include boredom, drowsiness and sexual dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big surprise, Hillary Clinton is not speaking. Hillary Clinton will not be speaking at the Democratic national convention. Usually when she's not talking it's just to Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When John Kerry was a little boy -- did you hear this? He liked to play make-believe and pretend he was Robin Hood. Isn't that nice. That's what he did as a little boy. Liked to pretend he was Robin Hood. Yeah, of course when Kerry played Robin Hood, instead of robbing the rich, he'd marry the rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush became the first US President to visit Michigan's Upper Peninsula since William Howard Taft. William Howard Taft was the last one to do it. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Who are they?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the diet company Slim Fast fired Whoopi Goldberg as their spokesperson after she appeared at a fundraiser and made vulgar comments about President Bush. Yeah, when asked about it, Slim Fast's president said, 'We're not firing Whoopi for her comments. We finally saw tape of her sitcom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know about these two. John Kerry and John Edwards have gotten so touchy-feely. They are -- they are always doing that. Now George Bush wants to ban gay campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush twins, I think you heard, are hitting the campaign trail for their dad. Whenever dad is asked a tough question, the Bush twins mud wrestle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She made obscene gestures. Whoopi Goldberg was fired as a Slim Fast spokesperson. Now she was hired to work for Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;First Lady Laura Bush said the job of being President is not for the faint of heart. How the hell did Dick Cheney qualify?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know a lot of people are wondering about Dick Cheney's future, and he said President Bush won't break up the team. That was his quote, 'Won't break up the team.' Hey, we're Lakers fans. We've heard that before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, a lot of Republicans saying that President Bush should drop Dick Cheney from the ticket and replace him with someone who could make President Bush look smarter and more in control. Who would that be, Dan Quayle?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, John Edwards got the youth and the good looks. So to compete with that, they're going to try to spruce up Dick Cheney's image. In fact, next week he's going to appear on the next installment of 'The Swan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And still a lot of controversy over President Bush's decision not to attend the NAACP convention. See, I don't think Bush gets it. Like they asked him why didn't speak at the NAACP, and he said, 'You know, I'm just not a fan of college ball.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John Kerry addressed the NAACP earlier this week, and he told the crowd, he said he knew what it was like to grow up on the street. Okay, sure, it was easy street, but a street's a street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, of course, Kerry will speak at the end of the Democratic convention. Of course, before him, you know, they're going to have days of speakers praising him, calling him a hero, saying he's the only hope for America. I just hope all this talk doesn't give John Kerry a big head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure your environmentalists heard about this. As you know, the Bush Administration wants to lift a ban on logging. And today, President Bush said that logging is something that should only be done between a man and a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week in 1790 that the District of Columbia became the seat of American government. You know, that's what they call it, the seat of American government. That's why so many asses live there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The weight loss company Slimfast, they dropped Whoopi Goldberg as their spokesperson after she delivered like an X-rated monologue about President Bush at this big fundraiser. Apparently, she used the F-word several times. Oh, that was Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Slimfast fired her because they were afraid that Americans would boycott the Slimfast company. Have you seen America lately? I think we've been boycotting Slimfast for years, haven't we, pretty much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Democratic National Convention they're not going to let Hillary Clinton address the convention. Do you know why? They're worried that if she speaks, if she addresses the crowd that she will overshadow John Kerry. Isn't that amazing? I'm thinking, 'Well, hell, the guy doing sound checks can overshadow John Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the polls, John Kerry is getting a big boost from what they call the Edwards' bounce, because he selected John Edwards to be his running mate. Edwards' bounce. Don't confuse that now with the Clinton bounce, because that will get you impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just announced that Hillary Clinton will speak at the Democratic convention. And in fact, she will introduce her husband, Bill Clinton. Which means he will be introduced as 'that lying son of a bitch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Health and Human Services officially recognized obesity as a medical illness. It finally happened, yeah. Doctors say symptoms include shortness of breath, and wideness of ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big security preparations for the upcoming Democratic convention. Hundreds of police, Secret Service agents, snipers, barbed wire and that's just to keep out Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry was speaking to the NAACP. And talking about flip flopping, he said he's for bling, but against bling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Of course, we're coming here from California, home of the 'girlie man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Governor Schwarzenegger, in trouble. Used the phrase 'girlie men' to refer to some Democratic legislators in Sacramento. Of course Democrats are now calling the remark homophobic. You know, even the 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guys' are going, 'Shut up! It's a joke!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To their credit, K-mart said they would stand by Martha. K-mart is standing by Martha. There you go. Yeah. And today, Whoopi Goldberg said, 'Boy, did I sign with the wrong company.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new acting director of the CIA says although there's no proof Iran was involved in the plot, they allowed eight of the September 11th hijackers across their border the year before the attack. Eight. Hey, so did we. We allowed 11. At least they stopped three of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the 9/11 Commission, now saying Iran, not Iraq, may have been involved in the attack. And in defense, President Bush said, 'Iran, Iraq. Hey, that's pretty good. I was only off by one letter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain is on the program tonight. John McCain. I tell you -- he was our first choice as a guest. And as a backup, we had John Edwards standing by, in case. In case he couldn't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush twins have joined the campaign to help their father in his election for president. Their Secret Service code names are Twinkle and Turquoise. Twinkle and Turquoise. And when Kerry and Edwards heard about it, they said, 'Hey, that's what we call each other. That's our code name.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards started this whole thing about there are two Americas. Now, John Kerry is saying -- there are two Americas. You know why they're doing this? See, this is to prepare us is in case they win, for a tax hike. You can say, 'Hey, my taxes are twice as much as they used to be.' Of course. See, there are two Americas now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medicare has now decided to recognize obesity as an illness. Wow. You thought Medicare was bankrupt before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obesity is an illness now. Bad enough workers calling in sick. Now, you're calling in fat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the 9/11 Commission report, they say it was Iran, Iran, not Iraq, that was helping Al Qaeda. So apparently, we invaded the wrong country because of a typo. A typo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 9/11 Commission has issued its report and next they're going to investigate how this program was nominated for five Emmy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger called the California Democratic lawyers 'girly men.' He said the Democrats in California were 'girly men.' And the Democrats were, well, they were unavailable for comment because they were at a screening of 'Delovely.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of excitement about the Democratic convention because now Hillary Clinton will actually be speaking at the convention. First she was not going to speak, and now she is going to speak and everyone is going crazy. As a matter of fact, Bill Clinton is bringing a date that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of controversy over our Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger calling Democratic opponents 'girly men.' Did you hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another hot day. What was it, 102 today? I was sweating like Arnold Schwarzenegger at a girlie man convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Schwarzenegger has not apologized for calling Sacramento legislators girlie men. You know, I'm not surprised. He still hasn't apologized for making that 'Jingle all the Way' movie.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that he is looking into whether Iran had anything to do with 9/11, but he's not declaring war yet. He said, first, he wants to know all the facts. So apparently, he's trying a new strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech the other day to the Amish people, President Bush said that God speaks through him. Which I don't know. You think God would mispronounce that many words? I'm not sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sandy Berger is now under criminal investigation for destroying highly classified intelligence documents. It's a big deal now. But his lawyer says what he did wasn't illegal, it was just sloppy. Which I think was Bill Clinton's defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has caused a huge international controversy after saying that Fidel Castro has made the Cuban sex tourist industry bigger than the one in Southeast Asia. Well, this has got congressional fact- finding tour written all over it, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Castro is not denying this. Castro says Cuba has the world's best- educated prostitutes. That's what he said. Kind of makes you wonder what these girls would have wound up doing if they hadn't stayed in school. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean was at the Washington, DC, airport, he's in a pay phone when a thief reaches in, grabs his wallet, ran off, stole Howard Dean's IDs. Yeah, I wonder if Howard screamed at the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Usually, when a Democratic presidential candidate gets robbed, it's not until November. So this is actually early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Got everything -- his wallet, money, everything. They said this is the worst thing to happen to Howard Dean since he was endorsed by Al Gore. It's just horrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little toddler in the former Soviet republic of Georgia has been found with two hearts. Yeah. This baby was born with two complete hearts. And today, Dick Cheney said, 'Bring me that child! Bring that child to me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Ronstadt &quot;got kicked out of the Aladdin Hotel. She's doing her show, and she's a big fan of Michael Moore and the 9/11 movie. Anyway, she dedicated a song to Michael Moore, and the audience went nuts, kicked her off, kicked her out of the hotel. In fact, they dragged her offstage using that same net they used on that tiger that attacked Roy. Horrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After she got thrown out of the Aladdin, she went down to the Paris Hotel, where she was hailed as a hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wildfires are raging in California, and earlier today, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that they were started when a scented candle was knocked over by a girlie man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold is in trouble because last week he called the California Democrats girlie men. Arnold said the Democratic lawmakers in California were girlie men and well, the Democrats are upset. Today they responded, one word response: Bitch!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess who was on Larry King last night? Martha Stewart. She says she is writing a book for people who are in the same situation as she is. So I guess it's aimed at arrogant billionaires who lie to the Feds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, of course, and John Edwards and their wives, the four of them now are touring seven states on a bus. So you have seen this? ... I mean what is this? Ricardos and the Mertzes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent interview, Martha Stewart says that the business part of her wants to accept her guilty verdict and move on. But the personal part of her wants to appeal the verdict. Now, Martha said the third part of her wants to put the prosecutor's balls in a food processor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney attended his 45th high-school reunion. That's right. Not surprisingly during high school Cheney was voted most likely not to live to his 45th high school reunion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, John Edwards attended a fundraiser at Disney World's Magic Kingdom. John Edwards, yeah. Unfortunately for Edwards, park officials kept coming up to him and asking where his mommy and daddy were.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic convention is next week. This is kind of interesting. The Clintons will be there, and they are arranging individual security details. Hillary surrounded by four Secret Service agents and Bill protected by Cat Woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the two big stories today, of course, involve celebrities. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Martha Stewart. One is having problems in Sacramento with girlie men. The other is going to prison with manly girls.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart's empire is said to be worth a billion dollars. A billion dollars. Or as John Kerry calls her, the one that got away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with ESPN magazine, John Kerry said he learned about life from playing sports. And the most frustrating thing about playing sports for Kerry, finding a helmet that fits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he also played a lot of sports as a child, but somehow the records were either lost or destroyed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to the Amish people earlier this week, President Bush said, 'I trust that God speaks through me.' Which sounds reassuring until you realize that's the same thing Courtney Love has been saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sandy Berger has stepped down as John Kerry's foreign policy adviser. I guess Kerry's people started to notice office supplies were missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton's former national security adviser, this Sandy Berger guy, is under investigation for sneaking highly classified documents out of the National Archives by stuffing them down his pants. Classified -- stuffing them down his pants. What is it about these Clinton people? They're always being investigated for something in their pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, the anniversary of Neil Armstrong's walking on the moon. 35 years ago. Hard to believe, isn't it? Yeah, the moonwalk. Well, kind of embarrassing -- when President Bush heard it was the anniversary of the moonwalk, he sent a congratulatory telegram to Michael Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, because of the war in Iraq and the war on terror, the moon is now safer than it's ever been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States government is blocking research into medicinal marijuana. Yeah, this according to scientists. If you consider Willy Nelson a scientist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Clinton national secure adviser Sandy Berger has been accused now of smuggling confidential documents out of his office in his pants. In his pants! I believe the last Democrat to have a bulge in his pants got impeached!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's daughter Jenna is campaigning with the President now. And today she stuck her tongue out at reporters. Yeah, President Bush was so furious at Jenna's childish behavior, that he called her a 'doodie head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To mark the 35th anniversary of the Apollo mission, President Bush met with Buzz Aldrin. Then he said, 'Where is Captain Kirk?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize we're less than four months from Election Day? Isn't that amazing? Four months. And less than six months from the final recount.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of John Kerry's advisers, Sandy Berger, he was also President Clinton's national security adviser. ... He's being charged with putting classified documents in his pants and sneaking them out of the National Archives. In Washington, that's what's known as 'inside the beltway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his defense, he said that he didn't stuff the documents down his pants for security reasons. He said he was just trying to impress girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, this way this way, when girls would say, 'What's that bulge in your pants?' He could say, 'It's classified.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Los Alamos National Laboratory, where research is done on all the nuclear weapons, they are reporting they are missing two computer disks with sensitive weapons information on them. Two of the disks are missing. How embarrassing is that? Now we can't even find our own weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush spoke with the Amish. He didn't want to, but it was the only group the only group he could find that wasn't upset about the high price of gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration announced this week they want to lift the ban on logging. This is part of their 'No tree left behind' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, the Bush twins are going online. They are doing an online chat on the Bush reelection Website. And it's historic. It's the first chat line in history where two people claiming to be attractive 22-year-old twins are actually attractive 22-year-old twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how much time the major TV networks are going to devote to convention coverage? Three hours. Three hours total. One hour a night for three nights. To pick a president. All right? That's about 1/10 of the time we devote to finding an 'American Idol,' okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bob Dole, God bless him, 81 years old today. Happy birthday to Bob Dole. Now if you don't remember Bob, he's the Republican who got the least amount of vote for president and didn't get the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, Governor Schwarzenegger's popularity has dropped from 64% to 57%. Apparently, he lost the girlie man vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The director of the Tour de France said he could see people in the crowd spitting at Lance Armstrong as he goes by. The sad part is that's the best treatment an American has gotten in France in probably 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Canada, a lesbian couple that got married last year are now seeking a divorce. Conservative groups are very upset. They say divorce is between a man and a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They released the 9/11 report today. It was finally released earlier today. President Bush wasted no time not reading it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Israel, a five-year-old ape at the zoo in Israel had the flu, and then when he got better, he started walking erect on his two feet, not on four legs, on two feet. He's walking around like this, just like a guy, just walking around. It's amazing, we have an ape walking upright. Listen to this, he's also thinking of running for governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the moon landing, President Bush met with Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong. Isn't that nice? However, there was one awkward moment when President Bush said to Armstrong, 'You know, I hear you're doing great in the Tour de France.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that when Bill Clinton's book was translated in China, the Chinese government added passages where Clinton praises Mao Tse Tung and the Chinese people. In fact, this is true, in the Chinese version, Clinton's book isn't called 'My Life.' It's called, 'Me Love You Long Time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush vowed he will not raise taxes in the next four years. He will not raise them. I believe it is hard, very difficult not to raise taxes when you're not president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More problems at the Aladdin Hotel. Did you hear about this today? Oh, boy. Last night, they threw a stripper out of one of the rooms for dedicating a lap dance to Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the 9/11 Commission report came out yesterday. President Bush said he is not going to read the report. He's going to wait for the books on tape version.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sandy Berger, he has not read the 9/11 report, either, but he does have a copy of it stuffed in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The 9/11 report that came out yesterday -- they stressed, they stressed in the report -- this is the main theme of the report, that we do not have the luxury of time. So what does Congress do today? Leave for a six-week vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Six weeks. Leave it to Congress to make George Bush look like a workaholic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Sandy Berger -- this guy was President Clinton's national security adviser, and he's also adviser to Senator Kerry -- he's now under criminal investigation for putting classified documents into his pants and sneaking them out of the National Archives. Well, thank God his pants never fell into enemy hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The 9/11 Commission report said that the attacks occurred due to the government's failure of imagination. See, I think that's wrong. Let me tell you something. Our government has a great imagination. We imagined weapons of mass destruction. We imagined we'd catch bin Laden. We thought the Iraqi people would love us. We're Disney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The report also calls for sweeping changes in our nation's intelligence-gathering systems. For example -- this is a good idea. From now on, they're going to have the CIA and the FBI exchange phone numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report also highlighted that the terrorists are trying to exploit the weaknesses in our border procedures. Which is pretty shocking, isn't it? We have border procedures? I thought the procedure was, you wait until dark and then run across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all saw that disturbing footage of the five hijackers passing through airport security the morning of September 11th. It was pretty horrible. See, that shows you how things have changed. See, that was a whole different era. I mean, airport security wasn't a high priority back then. I can remember when we used to let O.J. Simpson run through the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Jersey, an Amtrak train was delayed for 90 minutes yesterday after police found a note in a restroom that said, 'You're all sitting ducks.' That's what it said. Turns out it wasn't a threat, that was just Amtrak's new slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory investigating the theft of two top secret computer disks. These are two disks that had sensitive weapons information. They were stolen. How does that happen? You can't even take a pair of underpants from T.J. Maxx without the alarm going off. Can't we get that technology at the lab?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush spoke to the Amish people. See, I don't think he quite get it. He told the Amish people if he is re-elected, he promises to get them some electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In 'ESPN' magazine, John Kerry said he learned a lot about life from playing sports. He had to fight, like so many other kids from impoverished areas who had to turn to polo as a way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kerry campaign says that John Kerry will show his softer side at the convention. Softer side? We've already seen him and Edwards fondling each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I'll tell you, it's starting to get ugly. If you're in the United States military, you get free breast enhancement surgery. See, apparently, this is our last hope in trying to make the Iraqi people like us. Maybe if our boobs were bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;New York City is getting ready for the Republican convention. Earlier today Republican officials were in times square passing out security badges to the hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Security is going to be tight at the Republican convention. You will be frisked. You will be patted down and you will be groped. And that is just by Arnold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush laid out his goals for a second term. That is like me laying out my goals for hosting the Academy Awards again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Happy Birthday today to Monica Lewinsky, Monica, 31 years old today. So happy birthday to Monica Lewinsky, 31 years old today. That is a nice change, blowing candles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations, Lance Armstrong. Wonderful Tour de France. Very exciting. President Bush phoned Lance immediately after his win, which was a surprise. Not that Bush called him -- he was able to get past the French operator without the operator hanging up.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess President Bush asked Lance if he would be back next year, and Lance said he didn't know. And Bush said, 'I know how you feel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, both Bush and Kerry said they were very impressed by Lance's accomplishments. Well, sure, neither one of them is able to stay on a bike all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today the Democrats opened their convention in Boston. I can't wait to find out who they're going to nominate. It is so exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry decided on the new party slogan of the Democratic Party, 'Love it or shove it,' I believe that's the new slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Theresa Heinz, Kerry's wife, got mad at a reporter, told a reporter to 'shove it.' You know, it's a shame how the one America talks to the other America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when I was a kid, I remember John F. Kennedy, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.' Those are great quotes. What have we had this year? We had 'shove it,' 'girlie men,' and Dick Cheney saying 'go F yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security in Boston is unbelievable at the convention. Streets have been closed off, manhole covers welded shut. Even the Boston Archdiocese has been boarded up. They're not taking any chances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's in Boston to cover the convention? Al Jazeera, the Arab network. They are being allowed in to cover the convention. How'd you like to be the guy stuck in line behind them when they go through security, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first, the Democratic Party officials were reluctant to allow Al Jazeera in because they thought their coverage would be biased and hostile. And then they realized, well, it couldn't be any worse than Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry threw out the first ball before last night's Yankee-Red Sox game in Boston. You probably saw that. In fact, Kerry asked, 'Where do you want me on the field? I can take any position.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boston is a perfect city for the Democrats because the Democrats are like the Red Sox. They're optimistic in the spring, concerned in the summer, ready to fold in the fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry was at Cape Canaveral and had his picture taken. Take a look. There he is. Apparently getting ready to blast off for Planet Botox, apparently. That's right up there with Dukakis in the tank, isn't it, pretty much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN announced today that President Bush's missing National Guard records have been found. They were found. You know where they were? Inside Sandy Berger's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 9/11 Commission report was released last week. 575 pages long. And President Bush said today he was surprised to find out it was a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Bush spoke to the National Urban League council. See, I hate it when politicians speak to civil rights groups because they always try a little too hard, you know? Like Bush told the group he'd like to see more people owning their own crib.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new survey, two thirds of Americans say they oppose the use of physical torture against prisoners except in three cases. International terrorism, serial killers, and Martha Stewart. Those are the three.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the show, and I have to say I'm sorry to all you tourists. I have to apologize, because you picked a bad time to come to New York City. All of the hookers are now up in Boston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lance Armstrong &quot;won the sixth consecutive big bike race over there, the Tour de France. And it's a huge thing, and after the victory, President Bush called him to congratulate him on being the first man to walk on the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what Saddam Hussein does during the day. He writes poetry. He eats muffins. A little water coloring. And he works in a garden. Sounds like somebody is giving this guy a queer makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Saddam Hussein is demoralized and dejected. Hey, try a decade at CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry, John Kerry's wife, did you hear about this? She had kind of an altercation with some people from a newspaper and she told them to go shove it. I mean, who does she think she is, Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But campaigning in Florida, earlier today John Kerry brought a crowd to its feet when he announced had that his new wife would be actress Bonnie Hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was like the first day of the big Democratic National Convention there in Boston, and while the Democrats are holding their convention, the Republicans are down in Florida tinkering with the voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was introduced by his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, you know. And it's fascinating, and historians were saying after the speech they believe it's the first time in the history of political conventions that an introduction contained the phrase 'philandering weasel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happened over at Fenway Park in Boston. John Kerry threw out the first pitch. Talk about wild pitch, it went right, then left, then left, then right, then landed on the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Democratic National Convention in Boston, Teresa Heinz Kerry told a reporter to shove it! She said shove it, and out of habit, John Kerry asked, 'How high?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it was so hot, President Bush picked up a copy of the 9/11 report just to fan himself. That's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sweating like John Kerry trying to come up with a personality before Thursday's speech.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all see Hillary Clinton introduce Bill last night in Boston? Did you all watch that? It was kind of like the party faithful introducing the party unfaithful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one really awkward moment when she turned to Bill, slapped him, and said, 'Which of your little whores gave you that tie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know former President Clinton did not give the keynote address. However, I understand he did give a key, a note, and his address to a waitress who was working the concession stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who the 42nd president was? Al Gore. He was president for about 40 seconds. He was the 40-second president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That convention center in Boston, it is surrounded by police, they've got the FBI, they have sharpshooters on every roof. Security was tighter than Kerry's face after a botox injection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the convention last night, the Democrats were all upset about all the good jobs that were lost because of President Bush. Whoopi Goldberg, Linda Ronstadt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz has been taking a lot of criticism for telling a reporter 'shove it' the other day. You saw this on the news. Telling a guy to shove it. Can you blame her? What's the point of having a billion dollars if you can't tell people to shove it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why you have a billion dollars. What's more fun? 'I have a billion dollars. Shove it.' Exactly. Not a lot of minimum wage people going 'shove it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all see Kerry trying to throw out the first pitch at the Red Sox/Yankees game the other night? You see that pitch? It was more like this. Didn't even make it all the way to the plate. In fact, his pitch was so bad, today he was offered a contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that John Edwards' younger brother Wesley turned himself in to the state of Colorado for a warrant relating to a 1993 DUI arrest. Turned himself in. See, that proves Edwards is presidential. Have you noticed most presidents have embarrassing brothers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton had Roger Clinton. Jimmy Carter had his brother, Billy Carter. You know who the embarrassing brother is in the Bush family? George. Yeah. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush inviting Lance Armstrong to the White House. Not to congratulate him, to teach him how to ride a bike properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush fell off his bike again. He fell off again. In fact, today the Secret Service says, 'That's it, the training wheels are going back on. That's it, you've had a chance. Third time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN announced this week that President Bush's missing National Guard records have been found. And President Bush himself was stunned. He said, 'So that means I really was in the guard, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll in this week's Time magazine, 53% of people say it's time for someone else to be president. The other 47% say they're happy with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really cool in New York City. Cooler than it ought to be this time of year, but not as chilly as that hug last night between Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks saw the Democratic convention last night on TV? You know, to find this kind of excitement, you'd have to go back to the Mondale-Ferraro era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one uncomfortable moment at the convention last night when Al Gore accepted the nomination...that's too bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here was the line-up of speakers earlier tonight at the Democratic National Convention. You had Ted Kennedy kicking things off. Then you had Howard Dean. Then you had Teresa Heinz Kerry. Yes, sir, it was loose canon Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great moment for Teresa Heinz Kerry yesterday. She won a swearing contest with a sailor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore, controversial documentary filmmaker, was in attendance at the convention earlier tonight, which explains the extraordinarily tight security around the buffet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what the John Kerry slogan is? Very exciting. The theme is 'a lifetime of strength and service.' A lifetime of strength and service. Do you really want to run on an old Maytag slogan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Bill Clinton, former President Clinton last night, the big speech. How about bubba? Whoo! Watching that speech, he had to stop 23 times for applause and three times for sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news coming out of this 'shove it' controversy, Teresa Heinz Kerry and Dick Cheney just formed a rap group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said shove it, Teresa Heinz Kerry. Talk about coincidence, Hillary walked in on Bill and said, 'Stop shoving it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill of course spoke at the Democratic convention yesterday, and supporters really loved Bill Clinton's speech. They got all pumped up and started chanting 'Four more whores. Four more whores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Howard Dean spoke at the Democratic convention. They didn't give him a time limit. They just said turn the lights out when you leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Democrats are meeting in Boston this week for the big Democratic convention. ... This was very nice. For an extra $50 the hookers in Boston, they say they will dress up like Paul Revere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear President Clinton's speech Monday? I thought it was great. He gave a great speech. It was really good, really good very inspiring. But I tell you, you know what it did? It made me kind of nostalgic, you know? I reminded me of a time in this country when presidents could actually talk. Remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry. Very, very well educated woman. In fact, she can say 'shove it' in five different languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz told a reporter to go 'shove it' the other day. She just got very mad. And it's interesting how people react. When Hillary heard about this, this is what Hillary said, she said 'You go girl.' That's what Hillary said. John Kerry said she acted appropriately, and Bill Clinton said he likes it when girls talked dirty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In talking about the incident today, John Kerry said he would never criticize his wife. When a reporter asked him why, he said oh, he had over a billion reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Illinois senatorial candidate Barack Obama, he's the new rising star of the Democratic Party, he gave the keynote address at the Democratic convention. When they told President Bush about Obama, Bush said, 'Isn't that the guy we can't find? Why don't we grab him?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy blasted President Bush last night. Really went after him, and today, Kennedy is paying the price. Like, I understand just lost his deal with Slim Fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean also spoke last night, and this was impressive. He spoke to the entire convention without using a microphone, very impressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A computer crash wiped out voting records from Miami-Dade County touch-screen voting machine. Wiped out the records completely. Well, you could have knocked me over with a feather. It's almost always the place you least expect. A voting problem in Florida. I can't believe that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, the officials were stunned. They said, 'What? We keep voting records?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news, they did say this will not impact the election in November. Those votes will be counted and lost by hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lance Armstrong, on his way home, being called a hero for all Americans. President Bush called Lance and asked him what it was like to win again in 2004, and President Clinton called Lance and said, 'Hey, what's it's like being with Cheryl Crow?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you hear about this new movie, The Manchurian Candidate? Supposedly very scary. A very scary movie. It's about a President who gets a chip implanted in his head while he's in the military and people can tell him to do whatever they want. Today, Dick Cheney said, 'Shut up, you are ruining everything!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks watch the Democratic National Convention last night on the television? I'm telling you, with that kind of excitement, you'd have to go back to the, oh, Dukakis-Benson era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS, by the way, did not carry the convention last night. CBS, this network decided not to carry the convention. You know you're in trouble when you're too dull for CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy spoke at the convention last night. He looked fantastic, by the way, didn't he look great? He's lost so much weight he had to borrow a pants suit from Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards of course was at the convention, he has a very impressive resume. He was a trial lawyer, you know, that he was a Senator, and former host of Family Feud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mrs. Kerry, how about Teresa Heinz Kerry? Very exciting. She spoke to the convention last night, and probably a mistake for her to speak while holding her Chihuahua.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Kucinich also spoke at the convention, and by the way when he speaks, here are the side effects: Drowsiness, headache and sexual dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this at the Democratic National Convention, John Edwards spoke there. He described John Kerry by saying he is strong, decisive and hogs the covers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ratings for the coverage of the Democratic convention are very, very poor. Very bad. How are Kerry and Edwards going to beat Bush and Cheney if they can't beat Method and Red?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quick survey -- how many are going to vote for the Democratic candidate? How many are voting for the Republican candidate? How many are waiting for 'The Manchurian Candidate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard about this movie? 'The Manchurian Candidate?' Pretty scary. It's about a guy who gets a chip implanted in his head when he's in the military. Then he runs for president and the big corporations tell him what to do, which -- is a chip really necessary for that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just send in big campaign contributions. He'll take care of you. Don't need the chip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching all week, and the Republicans keep telling us the Democrats are trying to divide the country. Then the Democrats keep telling us the Republicans are trying to divide the country. And the result? The country is divided. Nice work, fellas. Yeah, hell of a job. Both sides doing a hell of a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, if you don't like a joke in the monologue tonight, don't worry. Hope is on the way. I want you to know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards gave a speech last night. I thought he did a great job, considering he was a last-minute replacement for John McCain. So he did great, the way he came in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Edwards' speech was so good, when he finished the delegates awarded him $80 million plus punitive damages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And once again, Edwards said there are two Americas. He said there are two Americas. And then later in the speech he announced that if he and Kerry are elected, they'll open a third America out near Anaheim possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were some surprises at the Democratic convention this week. Ron Reagan, Jr., son of the late president. He spoke about the Republicans' fear of stem cell research. And after that, Martha Stewart spoke about her fear of jail cell research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy looked pretty good. Ted Kennedy lost 40 pounds. Of course, the bad news, now his head looks even bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democrats keep mentioning that John Kerry is a decorated war hero. But do you know Dick Cheney has a purple heart? It's from eating steak. Okay, okay, okay. I admit. It's not in the military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, now that the Democratic convention is officially over, the Republicans are getting ready for theirs. And their new slogan for Bush - 'Four more wars, four more wars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush fell off his bicycle again. Apparently, happened when someone told him that the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 passed $100 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yasim bin Laden, anyway, he's one of Osama's 54 brothers and sisters. He says that Fahrenheit 9/11 has some inaccuracies about his family. Well, I hope this movie doesn't ruin the good bin Laden family name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore is now doing another documentary. This one's going to be about how bad things are with HMOs and America's health care. Yeah, I think it's going to be called, 'Bowling for Colons.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A report in the New York Times today shows that a bunch of brand new electronic voting machines down there in Florida, of all places, actually malfunctioned two years ago during a local election, leaving absolutely no way to do a recount and erasing any proof that anybody voted. You ever notice we never have any trouble with electronic lotto machines? Why is that? They never break. They work perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Florida bought these voting machines from the same company that makes the machines you see in the supermarket, you know, where you pick up the stuffed animal with the claw?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, you know, was the last night of the Democratic National Convention in Boston, and right about now the hookers are on the red eye back to New York, so look out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see any of that convention? Oh, my God, that convention, I mean, wow! Wow. For that kind of excitement, you had to go back to the Gore-Lieberman era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards last night, did you see John Edwards speaking, vice presidential...his speech was so dull that Teresa Heinz Kerry told him to shove it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bet this was kind of a sad day. John Kerry earlier tonight accepted the Democratic nomination, and out of habit, Al Gore demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you get a chance to listen to John Kerry's speech? How many of you actually heard the speech, his acceptance speech? It was a powerful speech. In his speech, he said that what he wanted to do...oh, who cares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now, now that the convention is over, all that's left is the Republican convention and then the crooked vote in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry showed up with all his Vietnam crewmates, and not to be outdone, next month here in New York City at the Republican convention, George W. Bush is going to show up with all his college drinking buddies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that my girlfriend is watching too much convention coverage. OK, the other night in bed she said, 'Spank me, Wolf Blitzer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, wow, John Edwards delivered a positive message to American that 'Hope is on the way. Hope is on the way.' And today, Dick Cheney replied, 'That is a lie, the world is a pit of misery and despair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, the Democrats have pledged to spend over $250 million to get rid of George Bush, and that to me seems excessive. All they need is a mountain bike and a pebble.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you. I'm Jay Leno, and I'm reporting for duty, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, he started off his speech by saying, 'I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.' And today, President Bush said, 'Great, send him to Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching all the pundits and all the critics today, and they said it was very smart of John Kerry to portray himself as an old soldier reporting for duty. They thought that was very clever. Of course, President Bush can do that. He can portray himself as an old soldier. Although, in Bush's case, the reporting for duty thing might be new.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry broke out his secret weapon. A personality. I didn't know he had one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry said he was really looking forward to giving the speech last night. He was anxious to find out what his policies were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the film, they showed a picture of a young John Kerry when he was in a rock and roll band. ... He explained he was in the rock band he said he did it because it's a great way to meet girls. That's what he said, it was a great way to meet girls. And today, President Clinton called him and said, 'If you think that's a great way to meet girls, wait until you become president.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, I learned an interesting little bit of trivia about John Kerry. Did you know this? Did you know he was once a soldier in Vietnam?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, the Democrats, very proud of John Kerry's service record, as we all should be. And they choose those words carefully. They always say 'decorated war hero.' Let me tell you why they do that. They always say it because hero, well, that appeals to women. Women like that hero. Okay? War, that appeals to men. They relate to that war. And decorated, that gets them the gay vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, John Kerry addressed President Bush directly by saying, 'In the weeks ahead, let's be optimistic.' Today President Bush fired back and said, 'What does making eyeglasses have to do with running the country?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The night before, vice presidential nominee John Edwards really got the crowd going by saying, 'Hope is on the way.' That's his new theme. Hope is on the way. But see, that means different things to different people. For example, when you tell President Bush hope is on the way, well, that means Dick Cheney is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You tell Dick Cheney hope is on the way, well, that means the ambulance is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards had some tough words for Osama bin Laden. He said, 'We will destroy you.' And then he said, 'If that doesn't work, we'll sue your ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John and Elizabeth Edwards celebrate their anniversary the &quot;same way every year. They go to Wendy's. ... You know, forget that hope is on the way stuff. This should be Edwards' platform. If he can convince his wife to go to Wendy's for his anniversary, think what he could convince world leaders to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US military doctors have determined that Saddam Hussein has a prostate infection. He might have a more serious medical problem, but he refuses to let them examine his prostate any further. So at least he's consistent. Now he won't let the prostate inspector in, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he figures, 'Hey, I was invaded by America once already. Okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New data just released shows the recession of 2001 might not have been a recession at all. So finally, some good news for those of you that lost your job or had your house or car repossessed. That was not a recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In honor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, his home country of Austria put him on a stamp. He's on a stamp in Austria. Which is great news for Arnold. Now he can say, 'Lick me,' without getting in any trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say a record number of Americans are now in prison. So good news for Martha Stewart. She's still trendy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many folks watched and enjoyed the Democratic convention? And it's over. Now the Republicans have just one month to become ethnically diverse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'll tell you, for the Democrats, I'm excited about Teresa Heinz Kerry. Have you been watching her? Did you see her all dressed in red like a bottle of ketchup?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;People saw former President Clinton in a jewelry store, and he purchased a $10,000 diamond necklace. Yes. Hillary, of course, was extremely excited. She can't wait to see who he gives it to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw John Kerry's acceptance speech? Did you guys see that? Yeah? It's the first time he's ever said 'I do' and didn't get any money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently before his speech, John Kerry met with Bill Clinton, and Kerry told Bill about being in Vietnam. And Bill told Kerry about being married to Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're heard the rumors, George Bush may be dropping Dick Cheney. That's the rumor, Vice President. He's not going to drop him, he's going to give him four more years. The bad news is, the doctor's only giving him two.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Help is on the way, ladies and gentlemen. That's what John Kerry was yelling over the weekend, 'Help is on the way.' No, I'm sorry, it was Mike Tyson's trainer trying to get him off the canvas.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, it was John Edwards' wedding anniversary. Edwards, Kerry, and their wives all stopped at a Wendy's to eat. ... You know, I don't want to say Kerry's wife Teresa has never been to Wendy's before, but she ordered the pheasant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Teresa Heinz, it's like a bad episode of 'Green Acres,' isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news today. At the Democratic National Convention in Boston, the balloons finally fell. Yeah, they finally came down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were supposed to cascade down on the stage after the convention -- all the balloons. And they didn't. Apparently got held up. A stage hand was supposed to pull a lever to make them -- it didn't. He kept pulling. Finally, Teresa Heinz just said, 'Just shove it, shove it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry and Edwards are on a 2-week, 21-state bus tour. On the side of their bus, it says, 'Believe in America.' You know what it says on the side of Ralph Nader's bus? 'Exact change only.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is back in Washington, DC. That's where he goes when he wants to get away from the Texas ranch for a couple of weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush and Cheney have a new campaign theme, 'Heart and Soul.' That's their new campaign theme, 'Heart and Soul.' Sounded a lot better than their first choice, 'Oil and gas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intelligence says that Al Qaeda plans to hit New York, Washington, and Newark, New Jersey. Allegedly, Al Qaeda has people in all three of these locations. You know, imagine when they were giving out those assignments, though, the terrorists talking afterwards. 'Hey, I got New York, what did you get?' 'I got Washington.' 'Ahmed, where are you going?' 'I got Newark, anybody want to change?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush said he is working hard to cut off Al Qaeda's finances. He wants to bankrupt them, and believe me, he's the man to do it. You know? I mean, he drove three companies into bankruptcy, what's one more?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney said that terrorist attacks are caused by the perception of weakness. Then he went back to his underground bunker in an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much. Wow, what an ovation, thank you. That lasted just about as long as a John Kerry convention bounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do we have a lot of folks visiting New York City? That's great. Well, congratulations, you got here just in time for terror alert Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here was a weird story. There's a guy playing from somewhere overseas to Ohio, and he's on the plane and he's doing like homework, he's got a work book and he's doing a thing and he writes in the little book, suicide bomber, and it's part of an English exercise, so he's arrested and detained and it turns out he was apparently using the Al Qaeda version of Hooked on Phonics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're shooting a big Hollywood movie for the first time ever at the United Nations. And you know what I was think, sadly, it's probably the most important work the UN has done in years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to his daughter, John Kerry once gave CPR to a drowning hamster. So you see, he does have a healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards and his wife, every year they celebrate their anniversary by going to Wendy', because apparently that's where they met, so every year on their anniversary they go to Wendy's. Well, this year John Kerry and Teresa Kerry also joined them at Wendy's. What a coincidence. Waiting on them all at Wendy's, Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had the Democratic National Convention last week, and according to the polls, John Kerry didn't get that much of a boost. Now getting desperate. He changed his slogan from &quot;Hope is on the way' to 'My wife will buy you a Lexus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The LA Times reporting today that Al Qaeda terrorists have been traced to Iran. And President Bush is talking tough. He said today he will invade Iran the minute he has evidence his approval rating is below 45%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said in a press conference yesterday that several of our major financial institutions are in danger of being hit by terrorists. When John Kerry heard about this, he had his wife, Teresa Heinz, shipped to an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, Al Qaeda is trying to bring down our US financial institutions. Let me tell you, that will not be easy to destroy. There's a lot of competition -- Enron, Adelphia, Global Crossing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are wondering if these terrorist threats are politically motivated, and today, Tom Ridge said in a press conference, 'We don't do politics in the Department of Homeland Security. Our job is to identify the threat and then assign it a pretty little color to go with it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards and John Kerry recently published their political promises and strategies in a book. It's in a book. See, that's smart, putting it in a book. That way they're certain to keep it from Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the new Kerry/Edwards book. It says, 'Our plan for America -- shampoo, rinse, repeat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry told George Stephanopoulos Sunday he has a secret plan for Iraq, but he can't reveal it unless he's elected president. And Bush has a secret plan, also. He can't talk about it, either, until he's really elected President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some bad news for John Kerry coming out of the Democratic convention. The balloons didn't fall, but apparently his poll numbers did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First time since 1972 a candidate didn't get the expected bump from their convention. In fact, not only did Kerry, he didn't get a bump, but Bush gained four percentage points. In fact, today, Bush asked Kerry if he'd like to speak at the Republican convention, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're on high terrorist alert here in New York City. You picked a nice time to come here on vacation, didn't you? Where are you going next week? Fallujah?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Tom Ridge comes out, said, 'Look out, get ready, hang on. Be careful. Watch what you're doing. Hang on to your wigs and keys.' And then now today we find out that the information that they're using to raise the terror alert thing is four years old. It's four years old. Apparently Bush got around to reading it today.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell that the information is dated because Al Qaeda was planning an attack during Al Gore's inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, on the one hand, don't kid yourself. There haven't been this many bomb threats since CBS announced its fall line-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all very excited, very pleased, former President Bill Clinton is on the show tonight. And as you already know this, as a result, security here in the theater is tighter than Joan Rivers' face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton, don't kid yourself, is still very popular. As a matter of fact, he is three points ahead of Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to his daughter, John Kerry once gave CPR to a hamster. Now wait a minute, didn't the same thing happen to Richard Gere?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge announced Al Qaeda has plans to attack buildings in Newark. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, Al Qaeda said, 'Are you crazy? Even we won't go to Newark.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, Tom Ridge is warning all Americans not to run with scissors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest polls say that Bush and Kerry are tied. President Bush said, 'Forget Kerry. How am I doing with the candidate from Manchuria?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry took one of his campaign bumper stickers and put one on his bus. He put it on his bus, ok? I'm saying, 'How about putting one over his wife's mouth if he really wants to win?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard today, the White House released a terror warning for the Olympics. Okay. It was the 1980 Olympics. They admit the information is a little old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House admitted the latest terror alert was based on information that was four years old. But this is interesting. The President's spokesman said that you have to keep in mind, see, Al Qaeda has a history of planning attacks well in advance. They plan the attack well in advance, and then they update those plans just before attacking. You know, kind of the opposite of what Bush does.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorist threats have been made against specific buildings. You know, I'm thinking, why don't we just surround those buildings with our National Guard troops? Oh, they're all in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal, Al Qaeda's plan is to bring the nation's big businesses and major corporations to their knees. They want to destroy these companies. Oh, that's Ralph Nader's platform. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, campaigning in Iowa, President Bush said the other side -- meaning John Kerry -- he said, 'The other side just talks a good game.' Well, nobody can accuse Bush of that, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Davenport, Iowa, three banks were robbed while Bush and Kerry were talking. See, I guess the robbers felt it's better they get the people's money before the politicians did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, have released a book. Here it is right here. It's called, 'Our plan for America.' This is their new book. And if you order now, they'll throw the second book in for free - 'Our plan for the other America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Drudge Report, they say a domestic centerpiece...of the Republican agenda for the second Bush term is to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service. They want to do away with the IRS. Getting rid of the IRS? So Bush really is serious about going after these terrorist organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Democratic convention...John Kerry's daughter told this story about how her dad once gave CPR to her hamster. ... And at the Republican convention, the Bush girls are going to tell the story of how when their pet hamster was bad, their dad built them a little electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts continue to be baffled over John Kerry's failure to get a bump in popularity after the convention. Usually it goes up. He didn't get anything. Jimmy Carter got a bump in '76. Reagan, he got a bump in '80. Bill Clinton not only got a bump in '92, he got a bump and a grind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, on cable, I saw my first Ralph Nader commercial. Do we have that? Take a look.&quot; Nader ad: &quot;People say Ralph Nader shouldn't be running for president, because he has no chance to win. They say a vote for Ralph Nader will only hurt John Kerry and is really a vote for George Bush. But we say this is America. Ralph Nader, it's your duty to run. I'm George W. Bush, and I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little frightening, the terror alert information was four years old. Four years old! I can't wait until 2008 and find out what's going on now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry and George W. Bush both were campaigning in Davenport, Iowa. Amazing? How can one town handle so much excitement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The statue of liberty has reopened. ... Now, here's the deal. It's open, but you can't go inside. I believe it's the same agreement John Kerry has with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both President Bush and John Kerry campaigned in Davenport, Iowa, just a few blocks from each other. Isn't that weird? This allowed voters the chance to get scared to death or bored to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration is receiving a lot of criticism because much of the information that led to this week's terror alert is almost four years old. That's right. You can tell that the intelligence is almost four years old because Homeland Security has almost solved 'Who let the dogs out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, residents of Missouri voted overwhelmingly to make gay marriage illegal. Not only that, the people of Missouri also voted to change their nickname to the 'Don't Show Me' state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1980's rock stars are launching a concert to defeat George Bush. I don't think it is working. Kerry and Edwards are running behind Hall and Oates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bobby Brown now says we should pull our troops out of Iraq. Bobby Brown. Ok, let's not do anything until we hear from Rick James.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Private Lynndie England, remember her from the Iraqi prison scandal? She's being court martialed. She has a pretty lame defense. What happens in Fallujah stays in Fallujah.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Private England said she and her boyfriend tortured Iraqi prisoners just to have a little fun. Whatever happened to miniature golf?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd. Man, you sound like those bank robbers in Davenport, Iowa, when all the cops were guarding Bush and Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Davenport, Iowa, while President Bush and John Kerry were giving campaign speeches, they had three bank robberies. Isn't that amazing? Isn't that unbelievable? Hey, you let Washington politicians into your town, you will attract the wrong element.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, both Bush and Kerry have been ruled out as suspects. You see, because of his wife, Kerry does not need the money. And come on, nobody believes Bush is smart enough to pull off this kind of job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see those pictures in the paper yesterday of Bush and Kerry campaigning in Iowa both holding up ears of corn as they are walking around...because that's what the people of Iowa make, corn. ... How come they don't do that in LA? You don't see candidates at Hollywood and Vine holding up huge vials of crack. Arm around a hooker -- big vial of crack - 'Vote for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in Iowa, President Bush told the crowd, 'With your help, Dick Cheney and I will have four more years.' I'm sorry, that's his meeting with the Supreme Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what happened on this date four years ago? Whatever it was, the Department of Homeland Security just found out about it today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest terror alert that Tom Ridge announced on Sunday was based on information that was four years old. It's four years old. You know those metal detectors, you've got everywhere? We should cash them in and get BS detectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since this was four years ago, the color level have been elevated to rust, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest intelligence says Al Qaeda wants to destroy our financial institutions like the stock market. Oooh! See, I'm not worried about this. If there was some secret sinister plan that was going to cause stocks to collapse, don't you think Martha Stewart would have known about it now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, John Kerry will be meeting with leaders of the Navajo Indian tribe. Apparently the Navajos found out there were two Americas. [They] Want them both back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Kerry is on the reservation, he will go by his Indian name, Long Face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week, Kerry and Edwards were eating at Wendy's. ... Then the minute they got back to the bus, they had a gourmet meal delivered from a yacht club of shrimp, grilled sea scallops and prosciutto-wrapped chicken. The only thing Mrs. Kerry recognized in Wendy's -- the ketchup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans now getting ready for their big convention in New York City. They have a plan for going into New York, they just don't have a plan for getting out. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A baseball company come out with these John Kerry and George Bush bobble head dolls. Pretty realistic. The John Kerry bobble head is huge. The George Bush bobble head is empty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the big finale of Simple Life 2, about the misadventures of a rich heiress traveling the countryside with her partner getting in trouble every time she opens her mouth. No, that's Teresa Heinz Kerry. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city is on a heightened state of alert, which is more than I can say for last night's audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself, this is serious. Earlier today in the West Village, the color coded threat level was raised to teal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iowa, a crowd gathered around John Kerry in a cornfield for a half hour, before they realized it was a scarecrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Bush campaign unveiled its new slogan. The new slogan is, 'We've turned the corner, and we're not turning back.' That's the slogan. Yeah. This replaces their old slogan, 'Do what Dick Cheney says, and nobody gets hurt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to CNN, many people along the campaign trail are now coming up to Teresa Kerry and telling her to keep speaking her mind. Not surprisingly, they all work for the Bush campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush tried to appeal to voters in Iowa by peeling a raw ear of corn and eating it. Afterwards, Bush said, 'That's the worst banana I've ever tasted.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a Bush rally, folks stood up and asked the President questions. It turned out they were plants. Bush knew the answers in advance and Bush said, 'Hey, it worked at Yale.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In less than a year Governor Schwarzenegger's learned a lot. He really has. He's learned tax structure. He's learned negotiation strategy. You've seen him on TV doing that. He's learned the ins and outs of state government. The only thing he hasn't learned the correct way to pronounce California.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tom Ridge announced today that homeland security has informed him there's a good chance Arnold may run for Governor. So at least the information is only a year old now. It's getting better. It's upgrading. It's upgrading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What was it, 92 today? I was sweating like President Bush looking at the latest job figures. Whoo. Doesn't look good on the labor front. They were hoping for, like, 200,000 jobs. No. They reported only 32,000 jobs created last month. 32,000. The Kerry's have more servants than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;32,000. That's nothing. Yesterday, President Bush told the unemployed people of Ohio 'There are a lot of jobs out there, you've just got to be willing to commute.' To, you know, like India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today Senator John Kerry embarked on an 1800-mile train trip through several key battle states 1800 miles on a train. That's the longest Kerry has ever gone without changing direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Kerry's and the Edwards' went to Wendy's the other day for lunch. They made a big deal, oh, 'we're regular people going to Wendy's. We're going to go to Wendy's.' But when they got back they secretly had a gourmet meal delivered from a nearby yacht club. So I guess there really are two Americas and they just don't like the food in the poorer one. That's basically the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Democrats mentioned that John Kerry is a decorated war hero. But do you know Dick Cheney has a purple heart?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This weekend John Kerry meeting with leaders of the Navajo Indian tribe. They like Kerry because his head reminds them of a totem pole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody is New York City getting ready for the Republican Convention. All the crack dealers, for example, are now selling Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There's a controversial new book that says back in Vietnam Kerry laughed when he burned down enemy huts and killed their animals. I don't believe it, John Kerry laughing? I just don't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sick of these summer TV shows. You know, it's all reality shows. Makeover shows, dating shows, quiz shows. You know, the only thing on TV all summer with a plot is al Qaeda.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now the FBI says al Qaeda may use limousines in future terrorist attacks. Do you know what that means? Jason Williams could be our first line of defense.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They also said al Qaeda may try to use rental vehicles that transport tourists around, like cabs. Boy, That's gotta be hard for a foreigner, Huh? Get hold of a cab?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Iraq's interim prime minister made a surprise visit to the holy city of Najaf. It was a surprise because he came back alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let me ask you something, I'm no expert here, is it me, or does every city over there seem to be a 'holy city'? You know, we should try that. like, 'President Bush and Senator Kerry campaigned today in the holy city of Toledo. Holy Toledo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oil production in southern Iraq was halted today because of the insurgency. Oil production was halted, and Dick Cheney said, 'That's it, we're out of here. I'm gone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush was in Maine for the wedding of his nephew, Jeb's son, George P. That sounds like an episode of 'Dukes of Hazard', doesn't it? Jeb's boy, George P. Got hitched! When they wheeled out the wedding cake, three oil company executives jumped out and Prince Bandar, best man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, President Bush, who got into Yale after his father, and then grandfather went there, talked about the evils of alumni getting preferential treatment. He said he had to knock on a lot of doors to be successful. See, this is the kind of thing that drives the Kerry people nuts. See, while President Bush inherited his money, Kerry earned his money the old-fashioned way. He married it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;For the very first time, Kerry has criticized President Bush's reaction to 9/11. Kerry said that if he were reading to the children at the moment it happened, he would have told the kids he had something important to attend to. Let me tell you something, if Kerry had been reading to the kids, first he would have had to wake 'em up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kerry met with leaders of the Navajo Indian tribe. He's been traveling cross country by train, he met with Indians along the way. He's traveling by train, he's meeting with Indians. What is this, 1882 now? Trying to get a treaty so they don't tear down our telegraph poles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;At a meeting of minority journalists, Kerry was asked last week if he would have gone to war, if Saddam Hussein had refused to disarm. And he said, this is the exact quote, 'You bet we might have.' That was the quote. See, it's that kind of decisive thinking. You see, can you imagine when he and Bush debate? Oh my God, I mean, one guy can't make up his mind, the other can't speak his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kerry and Edwards have released a new book which outlines their platform. I'm not sure it's going to help the way people view their relationship. This is the book, it just came out today, it's called ''Hope Is On The Way'. And there's Kerry and Edwards on the cover. It looks a little too chummy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;First Lady Laura Bush said that people shouldn't be saying that the benefits from stem cell research are right around the corner, they shouldn't say it's right around the corner, because it gives people false hope. Then later in the day, her husband said, 'The economic recovery is right around the corner'.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In a huge upset, Ralph Nader has failed to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot in California. How embarrassing is that? You can't get on the ballot in nutball California? Remember our governor's race? Imagine finding out you're not up for the legal qualifications of porn star Mary Cary and Gary Coleman. They were on the ballot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Good news for George Bush. Experts say he is favored to win the 'Last Comic Standing'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Now President Bush is trying to put a positive spin on the latest bad economic numbers. Today he declared victory on the war on jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot today, Tom Ridge raised the terror alert from elevated to sticky.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Greek officials announced that many -- this is what they said -- many Olympic security problems have now been solved. Many? Well, that makes you feel good, huh? When it comes to security, I think a simple majority is all you need.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today in Vegas, the terror alert was raised from who cares to not interested. No, this is really scary. The Justice Department revealed today that two years ago they had video surveillance which suggested that terrorists were targeting Las Vegas. But the public was not told, because they thought it would hurt tourism. So even terror alerts fall under 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas' apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said yesterday this is what he told people. He said, 'It doesn't make any sense to raise taxes on the rich, because rich people can figure out how to dodge taxes.' And then Dick Cheney said, 'Shut up, you're ruining everything.''&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John Kerry went to the Grand Canyon yesterday. He said he wanted to go someplace that made his head look a little smaller.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator Kerry met with the leaders of the Navajo Indian tribe. Kerry said the Indian people have been disrespected in the past, and under his administration, Indians will be treated with the dignity and reverence they deserve. Then he got in his Jeep Cherokee and drove away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And John Kerry has also proposed a ten-year plan for energy independence. And President Bush said today, 'Oh, it's not going to take that long to get all the oil out of Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Alan Keyes is running for the U.S. Senate in Illinois, even though he lives in Maryland. He lives in Maryland. He's going to run for the Senate in Illinois. I don't know if you saw him announce his candidacy yesterday. The guy was sweating like crazy. Now, I was trying to figure out why he was sweating. I think he was sweating, because, as I mentioned, he lives in Maryland. I think he's sweating, because he remembered something he said about Hillary Clinton four years ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Presidential candidates are very busy right now. I don't know if you've heard the latest, but yesterday, true story, John Kerry visited the Grand Canyon. Yeah, he went looked at the Grand Canyon, afterwards, Kerry said, 'I haven't seen crevices like that since I shaved this morning.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you heard the latest report out now that al Qaeda might try to use rental vehicles like taxi cabs to commit terrorist acts, and we the public, us, we're supposed to keep an eye out for any cab drivers who appear suspicious. ... What is a suspicious cab [driver]? What, clean shaven? Freshly bathed? Speaks English? Doesn't go ten miles out of the way?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you heard that other story that terrorist threats were made against the city of Las Vegas, but city officials didn't want to make them public, and now some people -- listen to this -- some people are accusing Las Vegas of putting money ahead of people. No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the amazing part of this story. Now, follow me. This gets a little complicated. But apparently, the justice department obtained video surveillance suggesting that al Qaeda was targeting Las Vegas. Okay? And after confiscating the tapes, the FBI tried to meet with the hotels to review the videos, but the hotels turned them down. Didn't want to see them. Because if they reviewed the tapes, it would make them more likely to be held libel in a civil court in the event of an attack. Isn't that pathetic? We are now more afraid of lawyers than we are of terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess these terrorists shot four days of footage, and of course, a lot of people are very, very nervous. Not that they are in Vegas, but they might be caught on videotape with someone other than their spouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Belgian airliner was forced to turn around after a cat got into the cockpit and scratched one of the pilots. ... We may have found the one country that has worse airline security than we do. Boy, that's got to be reassuring if you're a passenger. You go through security, have your bags checked for weapons, you got to take off your shoes, you walk through the little house, you do that whole thing, and then your plane gets hijacked by a cat. That's pretty creepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Ridge, the head of Homeland Security, he's not ruling out terrorism with this cat. ... He thinks the cat may be a member of Al Kitty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush was in Florida, where he asked voters to once again send him to the White House. The voters in Florida said, 'Once again, we didn't send you there in the first place.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American Bar Association has condemned the Bush administration's handling of foreign dissidents, calling it abusive and arrogant. And when told about the ABA's comments, President Bush said, 'Who cares what a bunch of basketball players think?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with democrats. John and Teresa, or as they now call them, 'cash and Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Drudge Report, John Kerry and his wife had a huge argument after a campaign rally in Arizona. They had a huge argument Sunday night, and they went and slept in separate hotel rooms. Yeah. So apparently, they're going after the Clinton vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, what happened was that they were having an intimate moment, and Kerry accidentally yelled out the name 'John Edwards.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the papers today, John Kerry said that as president he would remove a large number of troops from Iraq within the first six months. Well, that's smart, don't you think? In a war, it's always a good idea to tell the other side your plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced he will not -- he will not be attending the Republican Convention. So, uh-oh. They're gonna have to find another black guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'60 minutes' correspondent Mike Wallace, who is 86 years old, arrested for disorderly conduct in New York City, after arguing with parking officials over where his limo driver had parked. I tell you, mike was mad. He was ready to fight! I mean, at one point, he removed his jacket and his teeth. I mean, he was ready to go in there&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think mike has a good case. Today, I understand, he pled incontinence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Olympics start tomorrow. Did you know this? U.S. Athletes have been warned against extravagant flag waving. After winning Olympic medals, they're not to wave the flag, or they will be dealt with. Don't you love our country...you can burn the American flag, that's okay. But if you wave it, oh, my god, you're in serious trouble now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi soccer team beat Portugal in a preliminary game. What a big victory for Iraq. And I saw people in Baghdad going nuts. Shooting guns, turning over cars, starting fights, it looked like a war zone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Santa Monica, right up the street here, President Bush appeared with Arnold Schwarzenegger at a huge campaign rally. See, only in California can a governor who speaks German and a president who can barely speak English try to make themselves understood to a crowd that's primarily Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it me, or is Bush going everywhere Kerry goes? Have you noticed that? So far, in the past week, Bush has followed Kerry to Iowa, New Mexico, Las Vegas, now L.A., Kerry's here, too. And tomorrow, he follows him to Portland, Oregon. The only place he hasn't followed Kerry? I guess Vietnam. I guess that was the only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has some interesting views on our legal system. You see what he said today? Take a look.&quot; Bush: &quot;It's one thing to have justice, it's another thing to go overboard with justice.&quot; Leno: &quot;Yeah, you know. Can't be having too much justice, now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story, happened just a couple of hours ago, New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey...held a press conference, announced he is resigning as governor, because he had an extramarital affair with another man. Finally, a Democrat who can honestly say, 'I did not have sex with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The California Supreme Court has ruled that all the gay marriages that took place a couple months ago, null and void. ... In one day, do you realize, in one day, the supreme court has nullified almost as many marriages as Jennifer Lopez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China announced today they are considering sending engineers, scientists, teachers, and philosophers into space. Oh, yeah, and anyone who disagrees with the government, they go, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big opening ceremony for the Olympics earlier tonight. ... Actually, it's impressive. 202 nations marching together. 202. You know, that was supposed to happen in Iraq, but of course it didn't work out that way.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God bless President Bush. He tries. ... Like today he called the prime minister of Greece to wish him good luck in the games and to thank him for the Grecian Formula so popular around the world today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opening ceremonies also featured these giant statues. ... I see this one giant statue coming in with this enormous 40-foot head, and then I realize that's a John Kerry campaign commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole Greek tradition -- this guy in a loincloth is standing on a cube. ... You know who it was? The Governor of New Jersey. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of New Jersey, Jim McGreevey resigned yesterday after admitting to having an extramarital affair with another man. He called himself a 'gay American.' Yeah, like most gay people are immigrants. You know, they come here from the island of Gaydar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay American. Like the second part was in doubt. He's the Governor!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what annoys me? This guy is not resigning because he's gay. They're trying to make it look like -- no, he's resigning because he's a moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why he's resigning. Apparently, this boyfriend, this guy he had the affair with, 33 years old, a guy from Israel, met him in Israel in 2000. Brings him back here after 9/11, becomes head of homeland security for New Jersey. He's not even a citizen. The FBI won't even give him clearance. So then the guy resigns for being unqualified. He keeps him on the payroll for $110,000 a year, and now the guy is going to sue him for sexual harassment. Men. You can't live with them, you can't live without them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for? The Governor's kids. Like a bad episode of 'Trading Spouses.' 'Meet your new mommy, it's Larry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy's been married twice before. He's married twice, and now he's gay. You thought John Kerry couldn't make up his mind. What are you doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida, of course, being hit by Hurricane Charley. Authorities are telling people to evacuate certain areas. You know when Florida should be evacuated? On election day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney attacked John Kerry. Said John Kerry lacks deeply held convictions. And Kerry shot back today. He said, 'Hey, that's not completely true.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney also warned Americans about a group that is trying to impose their radical extremism on everyone else. He said, 'They have no tolerance for democracy and they have no tolerance for people with a different religious faith.' And then he said, 'I'm sorry, that's our platform.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are lining up big-name Hollywood celebrities to appear at the convention. I understand they've already got Affleck. Affleck's doing it. Not Ben, the duck. They've got the duck. AFLAC.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I understand why she would be reluctant to have her picture take with P. Diddy. We all know at one time they were married.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TBS will have a reality version or like the real thing of Gilligan's Island. They've already cast it. They have the bumbling goofball. They have the millionaire. No, wait a minute, that's the Bush-Cheney ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The USA, our athletes, 103 medals. That's pretty good. 103 medals. Congratulations. Although I understand today a group of Vietnam Swift Boat veterans have come forward and said a lot of the athletes didn't really earn all the medals.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Bush said today he was impressed with what he saw when he looked at the footage from Greece. Bush said it's hard to believe that's the same place that they filmed the John Travolta movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention started in New York City today. And the Republicans opened their convention in the traditional way -- with a prayer for more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans arrived in swift boats, or as they call them, 'Yachts.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said he will not be attending the convention in New York City. Well, that's reassuring, when the head of Homeland Security goes, 'I'm not going there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A scary moment for Vice President Dick Cheney. He was on Air Force 2, and a small plane came towards them. ... Air Force 2 had to take emergency evasive action to avoid hitting the small plane. And for a minute there, George Bush came this close to becoming acting president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the problem we're having in Iraq is because we won the war too quickly. He said the war was a 'catastrophic success.' He also called the economy a 'disastrous achievement.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest issue of GQ, Gentleman's Quarterly, John Kerry talks about what a man should look for in a woman. GQ? If John Kerry's going to talk about what he likes in a woman, shouldn't it be in Fortune or Money magazine, one of those?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore caught driving 75 miles an hour on a highway up in Oregon. Cited for speeding. Poor Al Gore. You know, he'll do anything to get his name on a ticket now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And poor Al, he didn't get paid, 'cause he didn't get the pizza there in under 30 minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest poll, it seems Ralph Nader now in double digits. Seems there are 12 people who are going to vote for him now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know where Ralph Nader was today? In Las Vegas. He was in Las Vegas today, where he denounced gambling. Good call, Ralph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later, he's coming to LA to criticize breast implants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news today for Florida. This is official. They've just selected the observers who will work on election day to make sure the votes are counted fairly. The bad news -- it's the Olympic gymnastic judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the MTV awards, &quot;The John Kerry daughters were on, and the George Bush daughters were on, and both sets of daughters were booed and I thought, 'Welcome to my world.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the Republicans in town, they had a lot of protestors. I'm telling you, it was just like the '60s, you know? The air was full of the aroma of tear gas and weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great time to be in New York City. We got the protestors. We got the riot police, the bomb sniffing dogs. Where do you folks go from here? Najaf?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the opening night of the Republican convention, and the theme for this year's convention is building a more hopeful...ah, who cares.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if you are a delegate, you are going to get frisked, patted down, you are going to get groped. And that's just by Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention goes on all week, but of course the highlight will be toward the end of the week. George Bush will show up for one day, you know, just like he did in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst moment of the Olympics is when that nut ran out of the crowd during the marathon and grabbed the front-runner. See, doesn't that make you mad? I mean, here's a guy, couldn't win a race by himself, so he decides to get publicity by ruining the chances of a man who should have won. You know, he's like the Ralph Nader of the Olympics.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What made&quot; the US women gymnasts &quot;so good is they perfected some new moves. That was the whole thing. My favorite was the triple reverse double backflip, where you end up the same place you started. I think that's called 'The John Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry is &quot;at his home in Nantucket this week doing his favorite thing, windsurfing. I mean, even his hobby depends on which way the wind blows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking at a church in Manhattan, Bill Clinton suggested that the Republicans forgot the Commandment, 'Thou shall not lie.' And believe me, when it comes to forgetting Commandments, Bill Clinton knows what he's talking about, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican National Convention got under way in New York last night. Or as the Democrats call it, 'Fear factor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday night's theme was courage. Tonight's theme was compassion. I believe Wednesday and Thursday's theme are gas and oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke tonight. ... They were going to have him speak the same night as President Bush. But then they realized, 'Uh-oh, the convention interpreter's head might have exploded, you know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Rudy Giuliani's speech last night, they ran a video of Frank Sinatra singing New York, New York. Finally, the Republicans figured out a way to get big name celebrities at conventions -- get the dead ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore was at the Republican convention last night, covering it for USA Today. Is that really the most unbiased reporter USA Today could find?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that like sending Jessica Simpson to cover the national spelling bee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security, very tight at the Republican convention. In fact, even the NRA people only allowed to bring one gun each.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 800,000 New Yorkers left during the convention. Boy, Bush really knows how to clear a room, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They raised the terror alert in New York to elevated. No New Yorkers leave. A threat by Al Qaeda to destroy our financial institutions. New Yorkers stand firm. Republicans come to town, 'Let's get out of here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Vice President Dick Cheney visited Ellis Island. For the younger kids, you know what Ellis Island is? Well, it's now considered an out-of-date immigration center. It's where foreigners would identify themselves, take medical exams and prove they were employable before they could enter the United States. Well, you see why it's out of date. We don't really do that anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI is now investigating whether there was a possible Israeli spy at the Pentagon. The FBI says it's very serious. They say Israel hasn't penetrated this far into our government -- well, since New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey had an affair with an Israeli man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans in the city, but don't worry, they will only be here until we're capable of self-rule. And they're leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the second day of the Republican convention, and tonight's theme was strength through...oh, who cares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's convention got off to a rousing start with the Log Cabin Republicans' medley of Broadway show stoppers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Moore &quot;was at the Republican convention last night, which explains the extraordinarily tight security around the buffet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night at the convention, just like here, Michael Moore was booed mercilessly, and I thought to myself, 'Hey, welcome to my world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was talking to Matt Lauer on the NBC Today Show. He's talking to Matt Lauer and he says, 'We cannot win the war on terrorism.' And then Matt Lauer started crying like a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, of course, yesterday went wind surfing because when you're in a statistical dead heat, it's time to kick back and relax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been crazy here in New York City with the convention. We have had naked people in the streets. We've had...all-night parties. Arrests. Yeah. And that's just the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of&quot; Republican delegate &quot;are going to Broadway shows, yeah. When asked about it, a spokesperson for the Republicans said, 'A lot of us are curious to see what gay people look like.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service tackled a man at Madison Square Garden because he was screaming profanities and running towards Vice President Dick Cheney's seat. Yeah. Afterwards, the Secret Service said they never realized Michael Moore could move so fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people in Britain are upset because last night at the Republican convention, Rudy Giuliani compared President Bush to Winston Churchill. Not only that, President Bush was upset because he has no idea who Winston Churchill is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger stopped at a firehouse, and he praised the firefighters for quote, this is an exact quote, 'The balls you have to do the jobs you do.' ... Then, so, he didn't appear sexist, Schwarzenegger told the female firefighters they had nice hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another 100 degree day here. I was sweating like John Kerry looking at my latest poll numbers. That's how hot it is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, I was sweating like President Bush trying to make up my mind on the war on terrorism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On NBC, President Bush said about the war on terrorism, 'I don't think you can win it.' And yesterday he said at the rally, 'We will win it.' And of course, John Kerry's furious. Now Bush is beating him at flip-flopping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Schwarzenegger &quot;gave a very personal, moving speech about his life. ... I learned some stuff I didn't know. Did you know Arnold wasn't even born here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold said he couldn't believe that a once-scrawny boy from Austria who couldn't speak English would one day be Governor of California. And Grey Davis said, 'Me neither! What happened?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just before his appearance last night, he pumped himself up for the speech. Did you see that? Arnold Schwarzenegger bench pressed Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold is a very powerful weapon for the Republicans. 'Cause he appeals to republicans, democrats, liberals, conservatives. The only group he doesn't appeal to? Film critics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laura Bush also spoke last night. Quite eloquent. ... Like, she never once referred to Teresa Heinz Kerry by name. She only called her 'that ketchup bitch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's speech tonight was interrupted 15 times by applause and five times by heart attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans went from Arnold Schwarzenegger last night to Dick Cheney tonight. You know what this is like? Arnold's like the picture in the dating service ads, and Dick's the guy that shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry keeping the low profile this week. He said he wanted to get away, he wanted to go somewhere where no one would ever expect to see him. So I guess he showed up at his old seat in the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on CNN today, President Bush said he remembers John Kerry's anti-war testimony from 1971, and he said talking about it in the campaign is fair game. And of course, people are shocked. I thought Bush couldn't remember anything from the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden's cook and chauffeur have now been captured. You get the feeling this is not the big victory the Republicans were hoping for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More good news. Apparently, we're now closing in on bin Laden's pool boy and pilates instructor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the hypocrite of the week award. Virginia Congressman Ed Shrock, who opposes gay marriage -- this guy opposed gay marriage, opposed gays in the military, suddenly dropped out of the congressional race after allegations came out he called a gay sex hotline. Yeah, he was on a gay sex hotline. And you know who answered the phone? The Governor of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore, got a speeding ticket in Oregon last week, cited for going nowhere fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor Al. I guess he tried to talk his way out of the ticket, and the cop fell asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems a dog in Cambodia has reportedly given birth to a kitten. President Bush said today, he's not sure how it happened, but he wants a constitutional amendment to ban it from ever happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is this week's National Geographic. The cost of fat -- it's got a naked fat woman on the cover. Bill Clinton said he thought it was their sexiest woman alive issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both President Bush and John Kerry very impressed with Lance Armstrong. Well sure, just being able to stay on a bike without falling off, you know, that's something neither one of them has been able to do all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting ready for our third hurricane, and John Kerry heard this and he says it is proof that George Bush is losing the war on weather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight the Republican convention, listen to this lineup, Dick Cheney, they had Zell Miller and Mitt Romney. That's right. It was old white guy Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Word is circulating that the Republicans are not tipping the hotel staff where they stay. I'm thinking, come on, folks, spread some of that Halliburton loot around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight Dick Cheney gave a hell of a speech. They only had to use the heart paddles twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Log Cabin Republicans were at the convention. ... They hate Hillary Clinton but they love what she's done with her hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that we can't win the war on terrorism. That's what he said on Monday. Then on Tuesday he said, we will win the war on terrorism. And earlier today, he predicted a tie.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Schwarzenegger's speech &quot;was an historic occasion. I believe it was the first time that a former Mr. Universe, bodybuilder addressed a national convention...well, gee, I guess since Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech last night at the convention, Arnold Schwarzenegger led the crowd in a chant of 'four more years.' ... Actually, Arnold said, 'Fire more ears.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, protesters made it inside the Republican convention and started taking off their clothes. Republicans said it could have been a lot worse. One of the naked protesters could have been Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the Republican Party held a reception for black Republicans. Yeah, apparently, the reception was a big success. They both showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actor Ron Silver is reportedly very worried that speaking the other night at the Republican convention could end up hurting his career. Then someone explained to him that being Ron Silver is what's hurting his career a little bit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night at a New York bar -- this is true -- a group of reporters were told to move out of their seats so President Bush's daughters could sit down and have a drink. Yeah, yeah, not because they're the daughters of the President, but because they're regulars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what was being called the biggest speech of his career, President George W. Bush took on his biggest enemy, the English language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech tonight President Bush said that America should create an ownership society. For example, if you're homeless, buy a home. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't have a job, buy a company. Give yourself a job. See how simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Vice President Dick Cheney told the delegates he was looking forward to four more years. Unfortunately his doctors only gave him two more years, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The keynote speaker at the Republican convention was Democratic Senator Zell Miller. A Democratic senator speaking at the Republican convention. Even John Kerry is going, 'Make up your mind, pal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking about the President, Zell Miller said, 'I have knocked on the door of this man's soul and found someone home.' See, first he tried to knock on the soul of Dick Cheney, but that had already been sold to the oil company so he went to the next door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans really went after John Kerry last night. Whew, they were on the attack. Kerry took so many shots, got two more purple hearts just from them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don King &quot;is a big Republican. ... But he wasn't there for the convention. He was in Madison Square Garden to promote the big Chris Matthews/Zell Miller fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his interview with Chris Matthews, &quot;You didn't see it, but the Secret Service had to take&quot; Zell Miller &quot;down with a tranquilizer dart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a terrific speech. Really good speech. That's where the Republicans are smart. They don't want to portray themselves as the right wing party, so they bring in an actor to by play a moderate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two women protesters outside Madison Square Garden tried to avoid being arrested by taking off their tops in front of the police. They were topless in front of the police. Right idea, wrong convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John Kerry was on vacation in Nantucket. When President Bush heard that Kerry was taking a vacation with the country at war, the economy in trouble and the nation on high alert, he said, 'Wow, maybe he really is presidential.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in GQ magazine this month, John Kerry discussed what he looked for in a woman. He said the most important thing was trust. Trust. You know, as in 'trust fund.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in Genre magazine, Janet Jackson said President Bush used her wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl to take the country's mind off of Iraq. Oh, shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or as Jesse Jackson might say - 'Bush used her rack to distract from Iraq.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention, of course is in New York. Last month, the Democratic convention was in Boston. And next month, Ralph Nader's convention is at the Dunkin' Donuts in Van Nuys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A stunning report from the Homeland Security Department has named 753 incidents of bad conduct by Air Marshals in just eight months including -- drinking on the job, drug use, and losing their weapons. You know what the punishment is? Putting them on leave with pay. Isn't that called a vacation?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they have time and money on their hands. You know they're going to do? They're going to get drunk, do drugs and lose their weapons again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in a shopping all in Greensburg, Pennsylvania tried to pass off a phony $200 bill. It had a picture of George Bush on it. ... The clerk at the store caught it right away. He said, 'Do you have anything smaller?' And she tried to give him two Cheneys and a Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the convention last night, you had Dick Cheney, he spoke, and...Zell Miller also spoke. So for one night I wasn't the dullest guy on CBS. Finally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney showed his gentle side. He flashed his warm sneer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One embarrassing moment, though, last night when Cheney's daughter made a move on the Bush twins, and I said, 'Whoa!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush accepted the nomination, and he said if he's reelected he promised to start reading memos so that's a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Bush has accepted the nomination, the next step, of course, is rigging of the voting machines, so there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, okay, most women would rather sleep with President Bush than John Kerry. However, most women said they would sleep with John Kerry if they were having trouble sleeping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in town for the convention have been going to see The Lion King on Broadway. It's true. Yeah. Yeah, in order to make the Republicans more comfortable, producers went through the script and replaced the word 'Africa' with 'Connecticut.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Vice President Dick Cheney delivered a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition. There's a Republican Jewish Coalition. Yeah, not surprisingly, the group is made up entirely of Cheney's cardiologists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After his speech last night, Dick Cheney's entire family came on stage with him, except for his lesbian daughter, Mary. When asked why, Mary said, 'I'm sorry, I just don't like to be anywhere near Dick.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got some good news on jobs today. Looks like he might be able to keep his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, taken right after the convention, President Bush is way up way up in the polls. In fact, they said if the election were held today, the Supreme Court would re-elect him 7-2.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both Bush and Kerry are now focusing on the battleground state of Ohio. See, Bush knows no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. Of course, before Bush, no Republican ever won the White House without winning the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Bush Administration official said today we were moving closer and closer to capturing Osama bin Laden. Of course we're moving closer. It's almost election day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't it seem weird that Osama bin Laden has a cook and a chauffeur? You know what that means? He could be a Republican. He might have been in New York last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with USA Today, former First Lady Barbara Bush says she tries to avoid news coverage of world events. So apparently, it's hereditary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you read this strange story about this woman that was caught trying to pass a counterfeit $200 bill that had a picture of George Bush on it? Turns out there's also a John Kerry bill. Pretty realistic. He's on both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a rally at a rally in the Midwest today, John Kerry vowed to tell the truth if he's elected president. ... See, that's when you know a candidate is really desperate, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like both John Kerry and Bill Clinton now have purple hearts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was stunned when I heard Bill Clinton was in the hospital, because I just assumed Hillary finally ran him over with the Mercedes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton was admitted last week after complaining of mild chest pains and shortness of breath. And today Dick Cheney said, 'Hey, to me, that's a good day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, the warning signs were there. People said they knew something was wrong when they saw Clinton grab his own chest for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The anesthesiologist had a news conference today. ... He said they had a little problem using the gas on Bill Clinton to put him under. Apparently, they couldn't get him to inhale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, John Kerry called, spoke to him for about ten minutes, he was out like a light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did call the President today. I couldn't get through. He was busy giving the nurse a sponge bath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is, of course, Labor Day, the day when Republicans traditionally thank the servants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch President Bush's speech last night? He did a very good job. And you know something? He didn't appear to be distracted by the balloons at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Last night President Bush said in his speech, 'We will always keep the promise of Social Security.' Let me tell you something. That's true. We'll always keep the promise. We'll get screwed on the Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John Kerry held a midnight rally in Ohio right after the Republican Convention. John Kerry giving a speech at midnight. How hard was it to stay awake at that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Kerry campaigned in three states -- anger, denial, and brooding indecision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The response to Dick Cheney's speech was given by John Edwards. A-ha! You see that? Proving once again, whenever there's a guy in an ambulance, a trial lawyer is not far behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And a lot of people were surprised Michael Moore showed up at the Republican Convention. Did you see that? He was also at the Democratic Convention. See, I think he must be one of those undecided voters they're both vying for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know you're at the Republican Convention when the largest breasts in the room belong to Michael Moore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And after the convention ended last night, some convention workers came in and began tearing down the set, and, of course, President Bush was thrilled. These are the first new jobs he's created in four years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the convention last night, one of the TV analysts said that the Republicans did a much better job than the Democrats at getting the balloons to fall. Is that the standard now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier in the day yesterday, President Bush was also in Queens, New York. See, this is where the President gets a little confused. Like, he told the residents of Queens, while he respects their lifestyle, he's still against them getting married.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said that today the doctor who's going to operate on President Clinton is one of the best. In fact, Dick Cheney has him on speed dial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said the problem with President Clinton, they said what was happening, not enough blood was getting to his heart. Gee, I wonder where it was going.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, they're going to bypass his heart. So this could turn him into a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what's sad? Clinton was supposed to go on a tour of upstate New York this weekend with Hillary. Now he has to spend it in bed with a bunch of nurses around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said Clinton must have been a little groggy, 'cause when they told him he had acute angina, he told the nurse, 'You, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton had quadruple by-pass surgery earlier today, and apparently the surgery went fine and he's going to be just great, so that's good news. .. The doctors say that within 48 hours, I will be able to start doing jokes about him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Al Gore had a similar procedure. ... About four years ago he had what is called an 'Oval Office' by-pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There is a giant hurricane heading toward Florida again. It's very serious. Earlier today, Governor Jeb Bush ordered the National Guard to place sand bags around the crooked voting machines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Well, trouble at the Republican Convention last night. You know the Bush twins, they were spotted at a security checkpoint by margarita-sniffing dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think it's been tough here in New York City having the Republican Convention, well, next week hang on because it's going to be the Taliban convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The opening ceremonies also featured these giant statues. I see this one giant statue coming in with this enormous 40-foot head, and then I realize that's a John Kerry campaign commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Democratic Senator Zell Miller endorsed President Bush. ... I believe Miller is the most prominent politician to switch sides, well, since James McGreevey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Republican Convention held in New York this week is finally over. ... Police say they haven't seen that many white people in Madison Square Garden since the last Neil Diamond concert.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;After the Republican National Convention ended, John Kerry gave a speech. And he said, this is a quote, 'The RNC stands for 'really not compassionate.' In response, President Bush said, 'Oh, yeah? Well the DNC stands for 'bunch of liberal wienies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush...stopped off in Pennsylvania, which he's already visited 34 times this campaign. ... You can tell he's been there a lot, 'cause instead of chanting 'Four more years,' the crowd chanted, 'Go somewhere else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a new ad, a group called 'The Log Cabin Republicans' says that President Bush is trying to have it both ways on gay rights. That's what they said. It's really unfair, 'cause having it both ways is gay rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton is &quot;expected to make a full recovery. ... In fact, today Clinton was seen roaming the halls with his hospital gown on backwards. So he's back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems the nurses have nicknamed him 'Spongebill Nopants.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He got the best of care. You saw it on the news. Teams of doctors holding press conferences. Scores of nurses. You know who I feel sorry for? The guy in the next bed waiting for open-heart surgery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is amazing after open heart surgery. He could leave the hospital in four to five days. Although he told Hillary it's going to be about three months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton looks &quot;like the picture of health. Here's my question. What the hell is keeping Michael Moore alive?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctors told&quot; President Clinton &quot;from now on to lay off the fat. He said, 'Look, I haven't seen her in years.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today john Kerry rushed to the hospital with chest pains after seeing his latest poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said Bush is ahead in a lot of key issues like Iraq, terrorism, and the economy, but Kerry is ahead on grammar, pronunciation, and overall nuance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry called Bill Clinton Saturday night in the hospital, and they say that Clinton talked to Kerry for 90 minutes. ... Clinton reportedly told Kerry to stop talking about Vietnam. Not during the campaign, on the phone. 'Will you stop? I'm in the hospital.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention, when they went to new york, they spent $255 million. Boosted the economy by $255 million. When the Democratic convention was in Boston, they only brought in $14.8 million. People wonder why. Well, sure, Democrats don't like spending their own money. Everybody knows that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has a new theme to his campaign. He says the 'W' in George W. Bush stands for 'wrong.' The wrong direction, the wrong policy. Gee, I wonder if Bush is going to now say the 'F' in john Kerry stands for 'flip-flop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Bush got the last laugh. He said, 'Everybody knows wrong starts with the letter 'R.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a shocking new book by Kitty Kelly, acquaintances of President Bush say that when he was in the National Guard...that he liked to sneak out back for a a joint or go in the bathroom and do cocaine. Isn't that unbelievable? They actually found people who saw Bush in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's going to get hurt by this? John Kerry. [Bush] did coke and marijuana. This means Bush could now carry California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On election night, if Kerry wins, NBC has hired Donald Trump to knock on the White House door and tell Bush, 'You're fired.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, while the Republican National Convention was in town, crime in New York City dropped 40%. That's right. That's if you don't consider prostitution a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry, after the big republican convention, is slipping in the polls. Yeah. I believe he is starting to lose confidence because all week long he's been telling people, 'Well, you know, it's a thrill just to be nominated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;new book says George Bush smoked marijuana while he was in the National Guard. Yep. And Bush said, 'See, I told you I was in the National Guard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton had the quadruple bypass surgery and is recovering nicely from that operation. The doctors told him he could resume having sex in about two weeks, and Hillary says, 'If he does, I'll kill him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders say he's recovering nicely. He's already hitting on the chubby nurse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it really surprised me. Who would have thought his heart would be the first organ to give out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former President Clinton underwent successful quadruple bypass surgery. Quadruple bypass -- yeah. Or, as Clinton calls it, a four- way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton spoke to John Kerry from his hospital bed and gave Kerry advice about the campaign. It's true. Apparently, it's the first time Clinton made a phone call from bed that didn't start with, 'What are you wearing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on the campaign trail, John Kerry -- listen to this -- he said that President Bush's middle initial stands for 'wrong.' Yeah, in response, President Bush said, 'My middle initial isn't 'R.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today it was so hot...I was sweating like President Bush when he heard they found his National Guard records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, I was sweating like Hillary Clinton looking for Bill's life insurance policy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said during surgery, they stopped Clinton's heart for 73 minutes. Isn't that amazing? 73 minutes. In fact, at one point, Clinton's entire life flashed before his eyes. And at first, he didn't recognize it, because it's nothing like his memoirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton's heart surgeon, the main guy that did the heart surgery, just like a month ago donated $2,000 to the Bush campaign. The doctor said he's not a big Republican, it was just a little thank you note from all the business he got from Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton got tens of thousands of get-well messages, which is nice. I guess President Bush said a prayer for him. Jesse Jackson went to see him in person. Rush Limbaugh sent over some pain pills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Clinton had no heart damage, his arteries are now clear, and they say he can live a long and healthy life...as long, his doctor says, as long as he practices some lifestyle self-control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors held a press conference yesterday. ... It kept getting asked over and over and over again, when could Clinton start, you know, campaigning for John Kerry. ... Finally, they turned to Kerry, and he said, 'Will you shut up?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry is behind Bush in the polls, so he's trying to reach out to more and more people. And I guess the Kerry campaign, they're experimenting with new slogans. Have you heard the latest one? ... 'Did somebody say Vietnam?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More of President Bush's National Guard records have been found, suggest he was absent from duty. That was the latest story today. They say he was not there. You know, that is so unfair. Hey, did you ever stop to consider for a minute that maybe, maybe Bush was on a secret, super secret, undercover National Guard mission?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said in a recent campaign rally, he said the middle initial 'W' in Bush's name stands for 'wrong.' Bush fired back in his typical style. He said, 'Hey, the middle initial 'F' in Kerry's name stands for 'phony.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, just came out today, Ralph Nader down to 1% of the popular vote. It seems to me, if you're at 1%can you still call it the 'popular vote?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has successfully gotten his name on the presidential ballot in Florida. .... Gee, I wonder who could have helped him with that. Jeb Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An official of the US State Department said today the US is close to capturing Osama bin Laden. We'd be even closer if Bush were behind in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Carolina yesterday, a masked man held up a bank using a rusty pitchfork. I think Zell Miller is starting to lose it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, the economy is finally showing signs of traction. Signs. Apparently jobs are now leaving so quickly, they're leaving skid marks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American Movie Channel, coming out with a documentary about Republicans in Hollywood. This should be the shortest documentary in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It includes everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger, all the way to Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is saying there's great risk if John Kerry wins. Yeah, the risk is President Bush won't be able to find another job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits are saying that Kerry's message is garbled. ... You know you're doing badly when you're running against Bush and you're the one that is garbled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton is wide awake and alert, ladies and gentlemen. Wide awake and alert. I wish we could say the same for our current President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For 73 minutes during the surgery, Clinton had no pulse, no heart beat, just like the Kerry campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Clinton's surgery, Americans have been lining up for heart checkups. ... I was thinking, Clinton has always had that effect on people. Because during his impeachment, Americans were lining up for oral sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is doing very well. ... In fact, yesterday, they took him off his respirator and today, they took him off his nurse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book that's coming out, when President Bush was on National Guard duty, he would sometimes sneak off to snort cocaine and smoke marijuana. When he heard this when he heard this, President Bush said, 'That's ridiculous. I never showed up for National Guard duty.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday, Dick Cheney said if John Kerry is elected president, America will face another attack. That's what he said, yeah. Then Cheney said, 'But if Bush wins, I'll call it off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was watching 'That '70s Show' last night. Or as we call it, the Bush/Kerry campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new investigation by the Boston Globe has concluded that President Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligations when in the National Guard. Wait 'til Swift Boat Veterans for Truth find out about this, they'll be furious.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a global poll, if the world could vote for the President of the US, they would choose John Kerry over President Bush. However, when the poll includes the Federation of Planets, then Ralph Nader wins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls today, Ralph Nader is down to 1% of the popular vote. 1% -- that's embarrassing! 1%, trailing, even low-fat milk, that's 2%!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this same poll, China said, overwhelmingly, they would vote for Kerry. China -- they can't even vote in their own country! Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These countries said they would choose John Kerry over George Bush, even though most of the people polled had no idea what John Kerry stands for. So in that way, I guess they're just like Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he has no plan to read that new book that trashes him by Kitty Kelley. ... When asked why he wasn't going to read it, Bush said, 'Well -- because it's a book.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry said today that only an idiot would fail to support her husband's healthcare plan. That's what she said. I'm confused. I thought she was John Kerry's healthcare plan. And his economic plan, and his retirement plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Bush toured the hurricane damage in Florida, and Bush really looked surprised. There are places boarded up for reasons other than his economic policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton is &quot;feeling much better -- like today, I understand, he asked for a desk in his room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Clinton's had the bypass surgery...his favorite rib joint in Arkansas, this is a place Clinton would always go -- a place called McClard's barbecue, says they want to add healthier items to the menu. There's a problem. When your favorite rib joint has the word 'lard' in the title.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Al Jazeera released a new tape featuring Osama bin Laden's number two man. Did you see this latest tape? Take a look at what he had to say.&quot; &quot;Ayman al Zawahiri&quot; tape: &quot;Are you ready for some football?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump &quot;has that cool move with his hands when he goes, 'You're fired.' Call that 'The Cobra.' He goes, 'You're fired.' Don't confuse that with Clinton. He uses his hand. 'You're hired. You're hired.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the assault weapons ban expires on Monday. Thank God I can go back to shooting geese with my Uzi!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are now accusing, it is really getting ugly. They are accusing John Kerry of using rich friends to help him get into Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry says that the 'W' in George W. Bush stands for 'wrong.' But he still can't explain what 'John Kerry' stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton...still heavily sedated. They have him grogged up on the pain killers and so forth. In fact, he is so loopy, that earlier today, he accidentally hit on Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Bill Clinton's operation -- true story, the number of patients complaining of similar chest pains has increased dramatically. Doctors are calling the trend the 'Bill Clinton Syndrome.' That's true. Yeah. Before the operation, the Bill Clinton Syndrome was characterized as a burning sensation in the groin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that a record made by a band that John Kerry was in during college has been bought for $2,500. Yeah. Meanwhile, the White House said that President Bush was in a college band, but that all the records have been lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. ... I was sweating like Dan Rather checking for forged documents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people think President Bush deserves four more years in the National Guard?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, 60 Minutes featured documents they claimed proved, they proved, President Bush did not fulfill his National Guard requirements. Well, now there are rumors that the documents could be forgeries. Of course Bush is stunned. He said, 'What? You mean I did show up for duty?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry unveiled his new campaign slogan. It's, 'Undecided voters, I'm just like you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is behind President Bush in the polls. Things don't look good. In fact, today Ralph Nader asked Kerry to drop out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Nader is &quot;down to 1%. 1%. He is now trailing Scott Peterson. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are saying that Vice President Dick Cheney went over the line last week when he said that if John Kerry became president, there's a danger we'll get hit again by terrorists. You can understand why Cheney would be afraid. I mean, if Kerry is president, Cheney won't have the secret underground bunker to go to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has vowed to tell the truth if he is elected president. That's what he said. He has vowed to tell the truth if he's elected. Up till then he'll continue to lie. But if his elected, we'll talk about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC, &quot;One of the commentators said that John Kerry seems to be a man who likes himself. Well, you know what they say, opposites attract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both sides are arguing about the formats of the big presidential debates. ... Bush wants to sit, Kerry wants to stand. ... You know, split the difference. Make them squat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors say Bill Clinton is resting comfortably. Well, of course he is. This is the first time in years he hasn't had to sleep on the sofa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton and John Kerry had another long telephone conversation last night. Kerry said they did not talk about the campaign. I guess they were both too embarrassed to bring it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton's hospitalization is bad news for John Kerry, 'cause Clinton was supposed to campaign for Kerry. For the next two months, he was supposed to be out there campaigning. Well, today Al Gore called Kerry and said, 'Hey, I can step in and do it.' And now Kerry's getting chest pains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Moore is &quot;on the cover of Rolling Stone this month. He says he has never, ever done drugs. ... Well, he did say he might try them if they were deep fried and covered in cheese sauce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is ready to report to prison. She's waiting now for a bed to become available at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution. She's waiting for an available bed. What is this, the Four Seasons?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news, third hurricane may hit Florida. Three hurricanes. For the third time, President Bush is doing nothing to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political pundits are saying that President Bush has made gains in two key states. Dazed and confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton, you know he had quadruple bypass surgery Monday, recovering nicely. ... President Clinton was a very, very healthy man. Oh, no there was one other time he was hospitalized in 1998 remember that when he fell off that chubby intern. Hurt his...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney denied he said that if John Kerry were elected, the US would have a terrorist attack. Yeah, Cheney explained, 'What I actually said was that if Kerry were elected, I would have a heart attack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is expected to be released from the hospital and he'll be allowed to go home. ... Clinton was excited about it and said, 'I never thought I'd be this eager to put my pants on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear 60 Minutes has a new policy? From now on, they've got to spend at least 60 minutes verifying their stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of questions about the authenticity of these memos they were showing on 60 Minutes, concerning President Bush and his service in the National Guard. Let me tell you something, if there's one thing you don't want to see, is a President who didn't really win the election being brought down by phony documents.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is scrambling to bolster President Bush's image, announcing yes, it is true President Bush did not go Vietnam, but he did attend an early screening of 'Apocalypse Now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Kerry unveiled his new campaign slogan: 'A mind is a terrible thing to make up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry just can't seem to shake this rich guy image, you know? Like today, he challenged President Bush to three debates and a yacht race.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidates are arguing about the exact format these presidential debates will take. Kerry wants to stand behind the podium. Bush wants to stand behind Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the nationwide ban on assault weapons scheduled to expire at midnight tonight. You still got to wait 20 minutes to buy your assault weapons, sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today John Kerry criticized Bush for not fighting to renew the ban. You can understand why Bush doesn't want to renew the ban on assault weapons. These are first weapons of mass destruction he's actually been able to find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, former President Bill Clinton went home from the hospital. ... He left the hospital on Friday, and didn't get home until this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary thinks he's still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he's a great patient. He's a nice man, Mr. Clinton, and people at the hospital said his after his surgery, they were excited, they were happy. In fact, the nurses said he really left his mark, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure if our homeland security has improved all that much. Like, today, the CIA called the state of Florida and said, 'There might be a hurricane headed your way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the AMC network at 10:00, they have a documentary called Republicans in Hollywood.' That's at 10:00. Then at 10:03, 'Democrats in Hollywood.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is done by the same director who brought you 'Soul Brothers of Salt Lake City.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WB network premiered the new series called 'Jack and Bobby.' It's about two young Irish brothers, and one of them is destined to become president of the United States. Actually, there was a third brother named Teddy, but as he grew older, his head got too big to fit in the TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's start off with the political news. Of course, the bickering, the name-calling, the endless lying back and forth. Great having Bill and Hillary back in the news again, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is out of the hospital. He returned home over the weekend. You know, Clinton must feel like that guy in the movie 'Misery.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's stuck in bed being taken care of by Hillary. She's got the big hammer, and she's not hitting him in the foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke to the members of the National Guard at the convention in Las Vegas today. Boy, a lot of those guys are really excited to see him. Well, sure. You know, a lot of them, they've been waiting since the early '70s to see him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on over at C-BS news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you're familiar with the allegations that the National Guard records displayed on 60 Minutes the other night, the allegations are they were fake. You know, as long as we're cracking down on fake stuff over on 60 Minutes, how about somebody look into Mike Wallace's hair, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New documents surfaced today proving that President Bush did not fulfill his National Guard service. CBS says they know they're new, 'cause they were just printed over the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics on 60 Minutes and the handling of these documents, they claim that there was a lack of forensic evidence and forensic experts. How can CBS have a lack of forensic experts? All they have is forensic experts. 'CSI: Miami,' 'CSI: New York,' 'CSI.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole controversy is making the Bush people very, very smug. They're saying, 'This proves that even network news can get it wrong.' I think we knew that when they said Bush won Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney said today that these economic numbers, you know the economy is so bad, he says it doesn't take into consideration all the people who make money on Ebay. Cheney said over 400,000 people make money on Ebay. That's what he said. Sure, 400,000. Well, yeah, if you've lost your job, you got to sell your house, your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Bush heard Cheney talking about Ebay, he said, 'Ebay? Didn't we kill him and his brother Uday over there?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nothing but disasters on the news. Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan, the Kerry campaign. It's just one disaster after another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry gave a pep talk to the Manville, Ohio, senior high school football team, and they went out and got creamed 34-7. ... I mean, after 10 minutes of listening to Kerry, half the team fell asleep, the other half was zigzagging all over the field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crime in the US is at a 30-year low. Lowest it's ever been since '72. And today, John Kerry blamed the whole thing on President Bush. He said the economy is so bad, even criminals having a hard time finding jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own Governor Schwarzenegger signed a bill, a new bill that makes it illegal to have sex with a dead body in California. First they ban smoking, now this! You can't live in this state anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number one film in the country is 'Resident Evil: The Apocalypse.' I believe this is Michael Moore's second film on President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WB premiered their new show called 'Jack and Bobby' about two brothers, and one of them grows up to become president of the US. They were going to do one about the Clinton brothers called 'Bill and Roger,' but then they realized, 'Oh, &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot;' had already been done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Playboy now planning a women of McDonald's issue. Naked women and McDonald's. It looks like Bill Clinton's dream come true, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said, 'It is critical,' -- this is a quote - 'It is critical that the president of the United States speak clearly and consistently.' Yeah, immediately afterwards, Bush resigned the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House called the producers of the Today Show and asked them not to air any more interviews with the author of a new book that's critical of President Bush. ... I guess the White House means business, because at the end of the call, they said, 'Do as we say, or you'll be asking, 'Where in the world is Matt Lauer?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the new shows coming out. CBS has a new news magazine coming out. It's called 'Dan Rather's Believe It Or Not.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, CBS, which stands for 'Can't Believe Story...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seems to be more and more evidence that these documents about Bush's time in the National Guard, you know, the ones they showed on 60 Minutes, they might be fake. That's the rumor. In fact, on Nightline, Ted Koppel said, 'If the Kerry campaign had put this stuff out, it would be unbelievably stupid. It would be the stupidest thing.' You know what that means? Oh, my God, Bush could be the smart one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what you call CBS News after they lose all their credibility? Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush addressed the National Guard troops at the National Guard Association in Las Vegas. President Bush told the troops that he's proud of his time in the National Guard. He said it was the best weekend of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He refused to answer any questions about his own military service. He said, 'Hey, what happens in the National Guard, stays in the National Guard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did tell the group, 'Hey, if I knew the National Guard met in Vegas all the time, I would have showed up more often.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was speaking to the National Guard about Iraq, I think he got a little confused. Yeah. Like at one point, he ordered the carpet bombing of the Aladdin Hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Bush spoke to what, a couple of thousand people at the National Guard convention yesterday, today, not one of them can remember seeing him there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine Bush and Kerry in Vegas at the same time...at the blackjack table, huh? I mean, one can't decide if he wants another card, the other can't count to 21.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitty Kelley &quot;says in her book that George Bush once belonged to a whites-only private club. Well, yeah, it's called the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's quite controversial, this Kitty Kelley, 'cause 20 years ago, she was accused of blurring the lines between gossip and journalism. See back then, there was a line between gossip and journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry campaigned in Wisconsin today. It was reported he had a big cheese head on. It turned out, no, that was his actual head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in Harper's Bazaar magazine, Teresa Heinz Kerry says she doesn't much care for the title 'First Lady.' Well, the way the campaign is going, I think she'll be okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this weather could affect the turnout on the election day. For example, if there's a hurricane in Texas, Kerry could win. If there's a rainstorm in Massachusetts, Bush could win. If it snows in hell, Ralph Nader could win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats and Republicans put aside their petty differences today. ... They sneaked themselves another pay raise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sixth pay raise in six years. Isn't this unbelievable? I mean, 9/11 recommendations? 'We'll do it next year.' Confirmed judges nominated three years ago? 'What's the hurry?' All for a pay raise - 'Me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey in Men's Health magazine, more men would rather be George Clooney for a day, because of all the women, than would rather be George Bush for a day and have all the power. Hey, I say, why not be Bill Clinton, have both?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Governor Schwarzenegger has passed a new law. It is now illegal in California to have sex with a corpse. There goes Tipper Gore's weekend, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart announced that she wants to serve her prison term as soon as possible, and she wants to serve it in Florida. And when they heard about it, Florida residents said, 'You know, we're getting really tired of fleeing the area.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big story this week, these forged documents, you know, the ones on 60 Minutes. Or as the Democrats call them - 'weapons of mass distraction.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was speculation, that someone may have intentionally duped Dan Rather and the 60 Minutes cast by passing them forged documents. See, don't you hate these scams that target the elderly? It is wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the latest issue of 'Cosmo.' Can you see what it says here? Look, get in close. 'How to tell if Dan Rather is faking it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Dan's getting a little desperate. Today, he produced what he said was another witness in his defense. He brought in 'Joan of Arcadia,' and she said God told her the documents were real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Dan Rather acknowledged that there are a lot of unanswered questions. Really? You know, the last time a TV show had this many unanswered questions, I think Jessica Simpson was on 'Jeopardy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on 60 Minutes II, Dan Rather interviewed the former secretary of the guy that supposedly wrote the memos. ... She said she never typed them, they're probably forgeries, but then she said, that's okay 'cause what's in them is true. ... So, it's kind of like those 'Penthouse letters to the editor.' You know what I mean? You know they're fake, but they get the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather has now challenged President Bush to answer the question. This is true. He said to President Bush, 'Did you get preferential treatment in the National Guard?' And I'll tell you, Bush gave him a one-word answer. He said - 'Duh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News has come forward and admitted they had phony documents also, and turned out it was just their regular script.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last election, we had phony documents. Remember in Florida? They were called ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Ted Kennedy, now hitting the campaign trail with Senator John Kerry. Well, you know what they say -- two huge heads are better than one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator Kennedy accused President Bush of incompetence. That's what he said. Bush fired back, he said 'Let me tell you something, pal. My bladder is working just fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry's in Las Vegas today, where he accused President Bush of living in a fantasy world, and the people in Vegas went 'Yeah, so?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush and Cheney say they're now targeting people that can't make up their minds, so, apparently, they're trying to get John Kerry's vote, as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vietnam stories, purple hearts, National Guard records -- is that really how we're going to decide who our next president's going to be? You know, let's go back to the old fashioned American way. Find the most handsome guy who's the best liar and give him the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A study by Yale University says that gambling may be healthy for senior citizens. I guess that pretty much proves we've given up trying to reform Medicare, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TV show, 'Green Acres' debuted on this day in 1965. Do you remember? It was a sitcom about a stuffy pompous lawyer and rich wife with a foreign accent or, as John Kerry and Theresa call them, trailblazers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the latest news, that 18,000 people have sent a petition to President Bush, asking him to pardon Martha Stewart. Yeah, not surprisingly, all the signatures were from prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a law banning the sale of assault weapons expired, which means, I can't believe this, it's now legal to buy Uzis and AK-47s. Yeah, the NRA said, 'Finally, Americans can protect their loved ones from up to 200 burglars at once.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times &quot;said the CBS memos about President Bush and the National Guard were fake, but accurate. ... Kind of like breasts in California, fake, but..&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, CBS unveiled their new slogan, 'Truth? You can't handle the truth!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one kind of embarrassing moment for President Bush when he heard that forged documents about him had been discovered. Bush said, 'What, you mean they found my diploma from Yale?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather got some bad news today. He's being investigated by 60 Minutes. Yeah, that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 60 Minutes the other night, Dan Rather interviewed the 86-year-old former Texas National Guard secretary, 86 years old. And Mike Wallace was furious. Oh, yeah. He complained to the producers, he said, 'How come Rather always gets to interview the hot chicks, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy new year if you're Jewish. Our Jewish viewers, happy new year. This is the year 5765. And today, again, President Bush was asked where he was in May of 1973, and Bush said, 'Come on, that was 3,792 years ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the difference between Hurricane Ivan and President Bush? We know Hurricane Ivan was in Alabama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader is in Las Vegas tomorrow. He's not addressing anyone, he's just going to 'The Star Trek Experience' at the Vegas Hilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The word is that Ralph Nader will be on the ballot in Florida. He will be on the ballot. Yeah, a lot of good it did Al Gore. But he's gonna be on the ballot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I saw a picture of John Edwards today. It was on the side of a carton of milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happened to this guy, has anybody seen him? Anybody seen Edwards? He's dropped out of sight, it's like he's vice president already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney was campaigning in Reno, Nevada. Actually did some gambling. Yeah, he was gambling. He had some bacon and eggs, and tried to walk up a flight of stairs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush again speaking on Iraq. He's talking a lot about it. You know, again, he got a little confused today. Like, he said he was so happy this year Muslims in Iraq will be free to celebrate Christmas.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin is using terrorism to increase his power, and erode his people's civil liberties. So, nice to see the American way of life catching up around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Glamour magazine, breast size has gone up in the last four years, that's what they say. They say the average breast size has gone up one full cup size in four years. See, this is a platform Bush should be running on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have Crosby and Nash on the show tonight. Again, it's Crosby and Nash, 'cause of the Bush economy, they had to lay off some people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats are saying that President Bush is refusing to take part in a town hall debate with John Kerry, 'cause Bush is worried about the questions the audience will ask him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, of course, the Emmy Awards last night. HBO got 32 Emmys, NBC took home 8, CBS News gave back 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss America winner Deidre Downs said &quot;I can't believe it&quot; &quot;three times. In fact, she was just one 'I can't believe it' short of the record set by Dan Rather when he found out the documents were fake.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on at CBS News. Or as what it stands for today, 'Can't Backup Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather admitted today just a few hours ago he admitted that he was misled about the authenticity of those documents. And you know, he was really upset. Today, he was talking about that 86-year-old woman. Remember the one he interviewed, the former Texas National Guard Secretary? Today he said, 'The bitch set me up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, opposite the Emmys, NBC showed 'Titanic.' You know, when I saw a ship going down, I just thought it was the Kerry campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When John Kerry saw the latest poll numbers, he called President Clinton again. Not for advice, just to make sure he still had his vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's going on 'Dr. Phil' next week. Dr. Phil? I mean, how bad is the campaign going that he needs grief counseling now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what happened to John Edwards? Anybody seen Edwards? Where is he? You know, you're not supposed to go to your secret, undisclosed location until you became vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a fiery speech at New York University today, John Kerry lashed out at President Bush. Kerry said, by one count, the President offered 23 different rationales for this war. And of course, Kerry's furious. He's got twice as many as that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice, the Emmy for best supporting actress went to Mrs. Jim McGreevey. So congratulations to the Governor's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty nasty...the memos about President Bush and the National Guard, and CBS is now saying that they were misled and they victims of a colossal hoax. ... Incidentally that's the same thing they said after hiring me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Bush Tax Proposals, As Read By John Kerry. 10. No estate tax for families with at least two US presidents. 9. W-2 form is now 'Dubya-2' form. 8. Under the simplified tax code, your refund check goes directly to Halliburton. 7. The reduced earned income tax credit is so unfair, it just makes me want to tear out my lustrous, finely groomed hair. 6. Attorney General Ashcroft gets to write off the entire US Constitution. 5. Texas Rangers can take a business loss for trading Sammy Sosa. 4. Eliminate all income taxes; just ask Teresa to cover the whole damn thing. 3. Cheney can claim Bush as a dependent. 2. $100 penalty if you pronounce it 'nuclear' instead of 'nucular.' 1. George W. Bush gets a deduction for mortgaging our entire future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS now admits that, yes, the Bush National Guard memo was a fake. And of course, this has caused a huge shakeup at CBS. Now, they're starting to question other shows, like does everybody really love Raymond?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At his big press conference today, John Kerry introduced his four-point plan for Iraq. Four points. One for each one of his positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard the two cable guys talking about it today. They said, 'We're now reaching the moment of truth.' ... Really? I've been watching this thing all summer. I haven't seen one moment of truth on either side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush and Kerry have now agreed to three, there's going to be three debates. The first debate will cover the 1960s. The second debate will cover the early '70s. And the third debate, if there's time, some topical issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know where the first debate is being held? Miami. Miami, Florida. I mean, first hurricanes. Now Bush and Kerry going down there? Haven't these people suffered enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say John Kerry already has begun preparing for the debates. ... He figured starting off by having his wife buy everyone in the audience a new car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though President Bush is leading in the polls, they say John Kerry's greatest strength is when he's under pressure. He can turn things around. And it's true. Sometimes, he even does it in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's going to appear on Dr. Phil's show next week. And not to be outdone, John Edwards is taping an episode of 'Where are they now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush gave a speech at the United Nations. I don't want to say it was a hostile crowd, but they had Bush standing behind a screen made of chicken wire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said, 'We are determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate.' Although by terror network, it wasn't clear whether he meant Al Qaeda or CBS.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS now admits they were misled by an unreliable source. I believe his name was a 'Daniel Rather.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors that Dan Rather could lose his job over this. Which would be ironic. Another American losing a job because of President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Saddam Hussein is depressed but defiant. He still claims that he is the constitutionally elected president of his country. So he's kind of like the Iraqi Al Gore, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cat Stevens, who is also known as Yusef Islam, he was denied access into the United States. ... His flight was from London, and it was diverted to Maine. Well, thank God he wasn't allowed in the United States, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, did we lose Bangor in a poker game or something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said his name turned up on a watch list, one of those do-not-fly lists. Which I can't imagine why with a name like Yusef Islam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm no security expert, but shouldn't they have checked the list before the plane took off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Us Weekly' says that Britney Spears may have faked her wedding. That's amazing. Britney Spears can fool the American public, but Dan Rather can't. It's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, an organized baseball game was played in Iraq today. And I'm glad there wasn't a chair-throwing incident like what happened in San Francisco. 'Cause the last thing you want to see is a Shiite hit the fan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it's autumn by the chilly reception George Bush got at the UN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, CBS now admits that Dan Rather's apology was a forgery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Homeland Security deported singer Cat Stevens. He's on an airplane, they take him off the airplane and send him back. Isn't that crazy? And today they're closing in on Gordon Lightfoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is going to jail, and Cat Stevens has been deported. Man, I feel so much safer now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be three debates, and each debate will have a category, and the categories will be domestic policy, foreign policy, and movie sidekicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debates, here are the ground rules, you cannot approach your opponent and you cannot touch your opponent. This is the same rule they had to use in the last McGreevey debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Us Weekly &quot;says they knew something was fishy&quot; about Britney Spears' wedding &quot;when they found out the wedding was performed by Dan Rather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush and Kerry &quot;campaigns are still trying to decide on the debate format. Yeah, apparently, Kerry wants a town hall format, while Bush wants to do rock/paper/scissors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech today, John Kerry said that the Bush Administration is so distracted that Osama bin Laden has become 'Osama bin Forgotten.' Yeah, then Kerry introduced his new speech writer, 9-year-old Mikey Sullivan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;49% of MTV viewers think the United States did the right thing by going into Iraq. 49%, yeah. The other 51% of MTV viewers said that Beyonce's booty is off the hook.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HBO has a big special. Cat Stevens live at Guant namo Bay.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cat Stevens &quot;was questioned by the FBI after his plane to Washington was diverted because his name was on a government terror list. You know it's bad enough our two candidates for president are stuck in the '70s. Apparently so is airport security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Yusuf Islam used to be Cat Stevens. And if I'm not mistaken, Osama bin Laden was formerly known as Vanilla Ice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather has now apologized twice for airing those forged documents. He had to do it twice because nobody believed it the first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk that Dan Rather may have to take early retirement. What is it like 73 in two weeks? You know, 60 Minutes is the only place where a 72-year-old man steps down is early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as the career started to take off, what happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republicans are now saying that Rather should lose his job because he misled the country with bogus information. Which is odd because the Democrats are saying the same thing about President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week from now, John Kerry will debate President Bush in Florida. Right now, Kerry has a bad cold and can barely understand what he's saying. So it looks like it should be a fair fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry's voice is so bad the doctors advised him to rest the throat and only give one position on each issue so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said that George Bush was incompetent with the handling of Iraq. And President Bush said John Kerry can't make up his mind. And you know what's really scary, they're both right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House doing everything they can to try and bolster President Bush's military image. Like, today they gave him a medal for campaigning in the 'Battleground State.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said today he'll go to the UN if elected president and persuade other nations to help fight the war on terror. War on terror, we can't even get these people to pay their parking tickets. Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon now considering a new rule to court-martial any soldier who patronizes a prostitute while stationed overseas. So in other words, buy American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a terrible day, miserable day, tough day, lousy day. I spent the entire afternoon at the airport waiting to pick up Cat Stevens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the airport in Frankfurt today, we captured Weird Al Yankovich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he's very excited about Cat Stevens. He says it's proving we're winning the war against singer/songwriters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are dark days here at CBS. You have CBS making up stories on the evening news, and then...earlier in the week, CBS was fined $500,000 for the Janet Jackson Super Bowl thing. $500,000. CBS says they were duped by a fake breast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be three debates. There will be categories. First category is domestic policy. Second category will be foreign policy. The third category will be girl groups from the '60s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new rule for the debate this year, candidates can't touch each other. ... That is the result of the last series of debates where Al Gore tried get George Bush to dirty dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush marked the opening of the American Indian national museum and he said, this is his quote, 'It will serve as a powerful reminder the spirit and vitality of American Indians.' Yeah, then Bush said, 'So, which one of you is Tonto?'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for the CBS network. They've now been fined $550,000 by the FCC for airing Janet Jackson showing her breast during the Super Bowl.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cat Stevens says he is outraged by the United States' refusal to allow him into the country. He says he has no choice now but to enter America the way most people do, climbing through a hole in the fence in San Diego.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big legal question, does Cat Stevens still get the frequent flyer miles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see who went nuts at the airport the other day? Elton John. ... First Cat Stevens, now Elton John. You know who should be in charge of Homeland Security? Dick Clark!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush gave a major speech about Iraq. Today, John Kerry gave a major speech about Iraq. You know what this means? The war in Vietnam may finally be over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said, 'You can't have free and fair elections in a place where there's no rule of law.' And in response, President Bush said, 'Oh, yeah? Well, what if your brother is governor of that state?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's still fighting a bad head cold. You know, with his head, that could last for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader attacked the Democrats today, calling them gutless, spineless, clueless and hapless, and the Democrats fired right back and said, 'Yeah, at least we're not voteless okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush attended the opening of the Smithsonian Institute's American Indian Museum in Washington, DC.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first baseball game has just been played in Iraq. I don't think they quite understand the concept. Like, a guy stole second, and they cut his feet off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is shaking up his staff, making a lot of changes in his campaign team. Today he actually fired Teresa, his wife, and replaced her with Heather Locklear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite Hurricane Jeanne, this Thursday's presidential debate in Miami is still on. Is that a good idea, with a hurricane going on in a presidential debate?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader said yes, he will participate in the presidential debates. Okay, it will be at home yelling at the screen, but he's gonna play a role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry tried to lower expectations of himself. He said this today he said, 'Bush has never lost a debate, and he's a formidable opponent.' And then Bush lowered expectations of himself when he said, 'Hey, what does 'formidable' mean?''&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry's advisers are now working hard to try and prepare him for the debates. You know, they told him he has to try and connect with regular people. ... They told him, if you need a glass of water, don't yell, 'Jeeves!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry predicted at a fundraiser the other day that Osama bin Laden will be captured just before the election. And of course, when President Bush heard this, he was furious. He said, 'How did she find out?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forbes magazine released its latest list of the 400 richest Americans. The richest woman on the list? Alice Walton, worth $18 billion. Or as John Kerry calls her, 'The one that got away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first Kerry-Bush debate takes place Thursday in Miami, and today thousands of local residents began evacuating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidates must remain at least 10 feet apart. And they cannot talk directly to one another. It's actually based on the John Kerry-Teresa Heinz Kerry prenup agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Debate experts say President Bush could win if he doesn't get off- message. And then they say Kerry could win if he gets a message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is working very hard preparing for these debates. I understand he just got one of those 'Hooked on Phonics' tapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said &quot;and I quote, 'Will President Bush mispronounce a word? I bet he will.' What is that -- are we so used to the President screwing up now, we're proud of it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry's people are having problems preparing him for the debate. You know, they keep trying to tell him, he doesn't talk like the regular 'Average Joe.' And Kerry said, 'Au contraire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A New York company is now making a video game that re-enacts John Kerry's war career. Players pretend they're Kerry in a Swift boat in Vietnam. ... Isn't there already a game based on John Kerry's life? 'Who wants to marry a millionaire?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big question now is will the Iraqi election take place as scheduled or not. You know, all the pundits, they're arguing. ... You know, we can't even figure out if Britney Spears is married, okay? How are we going to know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple months ago, people were complaining. They said, President Bush, he's going to use his influence with his Saudi friends to bring down the price of oil six months before the election. And now gas is $2.50 a gallon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is concerned about the lectern, Bush is worried about the room temperature, he's worried about lighting, and Kerry is making the mistake of concentrating on the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here are the categories of the debate. Foreign policy, domestic policy, and sitcom neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Nader &quot;couldn't get into the debates in Florida, but here's good news, Nader will be making an appearance on 'CSI Miami' as a guest cadaver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about all the ground rules that the candidates are insisting on&quot; for the Thursday debate. &quot;For example, John Kerry wants his podium to be tall enough so he can rest his hands, and President Bush wants his podium to be wide enough to hide Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech this week, John Kerry suggested that if President Bush is reelected, he might bring back a military draft. That's what Kerry said, yeah. When asked about it, President Bush said, 'Trust me. Even if I bring back the draft, there's plenty of ways to get around it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People think Martha Stewart &quot;was convicted for insider trading. She wasn't. She was convicted for lying to prosecutors. Her prison term is for giving false information and covering it up. And today, Dan Rather said, 'You can go to jail for that?! What?!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both Kerry and Bush campaigns have written up 32 pages of ground rules for the debates tomorrow night. ... Even the size of their dressing rooms have to be exactly the same. When did this become the battle of the divas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, he's been taking a few days off to prepare for the debates. In fact, today Bush had a microchip implanted in his ear. This way, Dick Cheney can speak to him directly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deal for the three debates almost fell apart. 'Cause John Kerry did not want the light to flash when his time was almost up, and Bush didn't want the light to flash, 'cause you know, he's easily distracted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this debate is helping the economy. In fact, this week, millions of people are buying those big-screen TVs so they can see Kerry's entire head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;experts...say Kerry can't look like a know-it-all, and Bush can't appear too simplistic. That's what it actually says. So the entire presidential race comes down to this. The smart guy has to look a little dumber, and the dumb guy has to look a little smarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, by the way: CBS News says they cannot vouch for the authenticity of John Kerry's tan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mom and I are going to watch the debates together. Here's what she's going to do. She plans to do a vodka shot every time Bush says 'flip-flop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now are the categories of the debates: Foreign policy, domestic policy and one-hit wonders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each candidate has agreed to 32 pages of rules. I'm telling you, it's like being a J-Lo husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the debates, &quot;USA Today said being likable is more important than being smart. ... Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Whew!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christina Aguilera has joined a campaign that encourages young voters to vote. When asked about it, Aguilera said, 'If I can't get teenage boys to pull a lever, no one can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush and Kerry negotiated a 32-page document full of rules. The rules - I mean, camera angles, size of the podium, even the temperature. You know, the one rule they should've put in? No lying!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another rule that Bush and Kerry wanted is you cannot move from behind the positions behind the podium. They can't move. Which is especially tough on Kerry -- not being allowed to change position.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strangest rule they had? Both Bush and Kerry agreed on this. No spandex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People underestimate President Bush when it comes to debating. He is pretty good at it. Back in college, he was able to argue both sides of that 'tastes great, less filling' debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry's people have been advising him, keep it simple. They say Kerry gets the biggest payoff when he uses the shortest sentence. Like when he said, 'I do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each podium had a light on top that would go on if either candidate talked past the allotted time. For Kerry, they actually used a tanning light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's when you know you've been eating too much of your wife's ketchup. Okay, when it starts coming through the pores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's hometown newspaper in Crawford, Texas, has endorsed John Kerry. However, well, President Bush doesn't know about it because it was in the newspaper.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore had a column in the paper yesterday called 'How to Debate George Bush.' Al Gore. I think it was next to Dan Rather's article, 'How to spot phony documents.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of porn stars has made a 'Porn for Kerry' DVD to help raise money for the campaign. Remember the good old days when campaign workers were just licking envelopes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California the other day we had a 6.0 earthquake. Yeah. But, Governor Schwarzenegger was not fazed by it. He said it was 'part of the plan to make California the most exciting action state -- with the shaking and the bobbing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart ordered to report to Alderton Federal prison in West Virginia by October 8th. It's a minimum security facility. As Martha likes to call it, a a gated community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the big debate earlier? It's exciting. I watched it on the big screen at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debates required months and months of negotiation, and a 32- page document agreement. That's also what it took to unseat Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, here's his strategy, he's seeking to portray John Kerry as confused. ... You think about it, you know you're in trouble when you're running against George Bush and you're the one who looks confused.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was in Miami, and all day Florida residents were nailing sheets of plywood over their TV screens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The security, though, and you can understand this, was very, very tight at the debate. They even searched the bags under Jim Lehrer's eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just my observation, at the debate, Bush appeared confident, he appeared relaxed, he appeared calm. That's right, he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were an awful lot of rules for the debates. For example, a light would flash when your two minutes are up. They had a red light that flashes indicating your two minutes are finished. Coincidentally, President Clinton had the same thing for interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush won the coin toss before the debate, and as a result, at the end, he was allowed to have the last word. True story, yeah. Not surprisingly, the word was 'courageosity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched the debate last night? Or, as the networks are calling it, 'Rich White Guy Survivor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch the rich white guy who went to Yale and wore the red tie, or the rich white guy who went to Yale and wore the blue tie?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like a boxing match, the big head versus the airhead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I keep hearing all these pundits on TV say the debates are really like a job interview for the candidates. And we're the bosses. We're doing the hiring. You know, if that's true, we need to put another ad in the paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first question went to John Kerry because he won the coin toss. Well, duh, of course he did. His wife owns all the coins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess a lot of people felt Kerry won the debate last night. Even a lot of Bush supporters felt he won. Bush didn't have a good night, if you saw it. I think he hadn't choked that bad since the last time he had a pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats think Kerry won. The Republicans think Bush won. And the swing voters, well, they were all watching porno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a stunning statement at a lecture at Harvard University, ultra- conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said, this is what he said, he said, 'Sexual orgies eliminate social tensions, and ought to be encouraged.' All those times you thought he and Dick Cheney were just duck hunting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the debate, &quot;for the first time in his life, Jim Lehrer was the most exciting person in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, Bush and Kerry debated foreign policy in Miami last night. Is Miami having a bad year or what? Haven't these people suffered enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night's debate was on foreign policy and if you saw it you know Bush spent the entire night gloating about the arrest of Cat Stevens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know about this but one of the ground rules for the debate, Bush and Kerry were not allowed to touch during the debate. But don't worry, they made up for it after the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's it for George Bush. He will not have to be in the next debate much his dad got him out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I missed&quot; the debate. &quot;I watched 'Pimp My Ride.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the first, the very first presidential debate, and it lasted a full 90 minutes. It was 90 minutes long. Yeah. Or, as President Bush calls it, three 'Sponge Bobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, during the debate, there were several tense moments when President Bush and John Kerry really when after each other. Not only that, Ralph Nader got into a heated discussion with the guy working the McDonald's drive-thru.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prime Minister Tony Blair is recovering from a mild operation to repair a heart flutter. Doctors said his heart first started to flutter when he watched President Bush trying to explain his position on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got some bad news today. Another debate on Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say Bush was off his game the other night. They said he looked distracted, confused, at a loss for words. Off his game? That is Bush's game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news from the debates, the terror alert on John Kerry's face has gone from orange back to pasty white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw it on the cover of Newsweek today and ABC, CNN -- they all say that John Kerry won the debate the other night. Kerry won. Well, I just hope this doesn't give him a swelled head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love some of the hard-hitting questions the other night. 'Senator Kerry, do you believe you would do a better job preventing another 9/11?' And Kerry said, 'Yes, I do, Jim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits also said that President Bush seemed unprepared and looked tired. They say what Bush needs to do for Friday is two things -- study videos of John Kerry speaking and get plenty of sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night is the big vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards. The heartthrob versus the throbbing heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they say the closeness of this race, right now, makes tomorrow night's vice presidential debate almost important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Fox reporter who covered the Kerry campaign for Fox, a guy named Carl Cameron. He's in a lot of trouble for posting fake quotes for John Kerry on the Fox News Website. Four fake quotes. He said it was all a joke. Kind of like 'fair and balanced.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how the network works. You see, CBS makes up stuff about Bush, Fox makes up things about Kerry. Fair and balanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the debate, &quot;Kerry is so confident that he's windsurfing again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very strong performance for John Kerry at the debate. ... Kerry even picked up the support of one of the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts are saying that if this was a game show, Bush would have gone home with a handshake and a quart of motor oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight, of course, the big vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards. The Litigator versus The Defibrillator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're calling it 'the battle of the undisclosed location.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Edwards and Cheney together? I mean, doesn't it look like Mr. Wilson yelling at Dennis the Menace?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. If Cheney's debating tonight, who's running the country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most amazing part of the debate tonight is when Dick Cheney told Edwards in his Darth Vader voice, 'John, I am your father.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of embarrassing, President Bush called Dick Cheney and told him he might not be able to watch the debate tonight, because, you know, it's opposite baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential candidates are dead even. ... And you can see it in their faces. Kerry's expression looked like he's dead. And Bush looks like he wants to get even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, Bush and Kerry are tied at 49% each, and Ralph Nader is at 1%. The margin of error is 3%. That means Ralph Nader is now trailing the margin of error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always like the people who say they'd like to see a mixture of Bush and Kerry together. Oh, yeah, that'd be the perfect candidate. A boring guy who trips over his words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see where President Bush made some mistakes during the debate, like when he said, 'I know how this world works.' You think that's true? You think maybe President Bush doesn't even know how the magic wallet works?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was asked about the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens. And he said it was good news for the folks who make lava lamps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a movement across the country now to give felons the right to vote. ... Is that a good idea? Do you want to give inmates the right to vote? I mean, you're talking about a potential voting base of millions of voters. Do you really want candidates now trying to get the felon vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I'll take 100,000 cops off the street! I'll remove all security cameras at 7-Eleven! Cab drivers must carry $500 minimum!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kerry campaign &quot;just released new x-rays that show shrapnel still lodged in John Kerry's leg from Vietnam. And of course the White House fighting back. Today, they released bits of pretzel lodged in Bush's throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cat Stevens said today, that since his run-in with homeland security, sales of his album have actually increased. ... And today, Captain and Tenille said, 'Hey, how do we get on that do not fly thing?&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you ever see the pictures of the Supreme Court in the press? How old are these guys? The cast of 60 Minutes looks like a boy band compared to these guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks following Mount St. Helens? It's getting ready to erupt. John Kerry said it's proof that Bush is losing the war on volcanoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought Dick Cheney did pretty well. He only flat lined twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for John Edwards. If he does not win in November, he has a firm offer to be the new host of Family Feud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an awkward moment tonight at the vice presidential debates when Gwen Ifill, the moderator, was hit on by Dick Cheney's daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political experts -- this is true -- say that Dick Cheney was at a disadvantage during tonight's debate because Cheney is short, fat and unhealthy-looking. ... Yeah, the debate's moderator made it worse when he introduced Cheney as the white Ruben Studdard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, an author who's writing a book about Dick Cheney, said that Cheney is misunderstood and is not a monster. Then the author admitted, 'Cheney told me if I didn't say that, he'd eat my children.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night they had the big vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards. The CEO versus the trial lawyer. Or as I call it, 'The Shark Tale.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Cheney next to Edwards? Don't they look like the before and after shot on the show 'Extreme Makeover?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people say John Edwards won the debate. Some people say Dick Cheney won the debate. I think most people say, who cares. It's the vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you argue your qualifications to be the vice president? 'You know, if you need someone to run this country, I'm the second best man for the job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debate, President Bush is in the Oval Office with the TV on. He was cheering, screaming, jumping up and down. He was watching the Yankee game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the John Edwards-Dick Cheney debate for vice president? Really? That's surprising because according to the Neilson ratings more people watched A&amp;E's biography of Joyce Dewitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards and Cheney sitting there together at the desk, sitting there together, they looked like the dinner theater production of Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard about this, the evening ended badly for Edwards. Right after the debate he was roughed up in the parking lot by Cheney's lesbian daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debate, John Edwards accused Dick Cheney of 'not being straight with the American people.' That's what he said. Yeah, and apparently, Cheney misunderstood, 'cause he started yelling, 'Who you callin' gay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's debate, there were four reporters for every person in the audience. Yeah, not only that, there were four paramedics for every Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And doesn't Dick Cheney look like the guy whose picture you actually put in the frame when you get it home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney claimed that was the first time he ever met Edwards, which turns out not to be true. They met at three other occasions - once at a prayer breakfast, once on Meet the Press, and one crazy night at a hotel in Encino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is the second presidential debate, or as the Republicans are calling it, 'Fear Factor!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night's debate in St. Louis will be before an audience made up entirely of undecided voters, which creates a huge dilemma for John Kerry. Does sit on the stage beside President Bush, or does he sit in the audience with all of the other people who can't make up their minds?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little trouble for President Bush today during his debate preparations. They asked him about his plans for dealing with Hamas, and he said, 'They are fine with me, as long as they don't try to get married.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of porn stars has made a DVD called 'Porn Stars for Kerry.' ... They made a porno movie to raise money for him. Let's just hope this one doesn't feature Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chief UN weapons inspector, Charles Duelfer, said Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction, had no chemical or biological stockpiles when the war in Iraq began. And President Bush said the timing of this information seems politically motivated. ... See those Democrats are sneaky. Now, they're resorting to the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, it's their first free election in Afghanistan. This is a very big thing. However, they're expecting voter fraud, disruption at the polls and intimidation of voters. So I guess the American style of democracy is really catching on over there, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second debate, &quot;George Bush's challenge will be to stretch four- and-a-half minutes of meaningless platitudes into an hour and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the first debate, the candidates were standing at the podium, standing at the podium. Second debate they'll be sitting on stools. And the third debate they'll be lying prone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Their 29th wedding anniversary this weekend. 29 years. They'll be celebrating with a romantic dinner, and I understand Bill is bringing a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Clintons are very, very close. In 29 years, Hillary is the only woman that Bill has ever cheated on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, President Bush and John Kerry will hold their second presidential debate on TV. Or as most Americans call it, game three between the Yankees and the Twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA just came out with a new report, and it says that Saddam Hussein was so fearful of the US that he used the phone only two times after 1990. Yeah, once to call his generals, and once to vote for Justin Guarini.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the second presidential debate, which was in a town hall format. You know what that is? That's where everyday Americans, and not just reporters, get a chance to have their questions avoided.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to relax, President Bush spent today fishing in the rain. He went fishing today. Am I missing something here? Are they afraid maybe he was a little too prepared at the last one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, John Kerry stayed at a hotel in Colorado to get ready. Kobe called him and said, 'Whatever you do, don't order room service!&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's debate was in high def. Do you know what that means, 'high def'? That means when you're watching, you have to be high or deaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, do you know there are now dating services that fix people up based on their political leaning? Like, if you're Republican, they fix you up with a Republican. If you're a Democrat, they fix you up with a Democrat. If you're a Nader supporter, they'll fix you up with Ralph Nader. Because he's not doing anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate &quot;was what they call the town hall meeting format. Both of the candidates were seated on stool. Coincidentally, I also watched it while seated on a stool...at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was funny, sitting on stools. From force of habit, Bush said scotch and water, hold the ice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's topic for the debate was domestic policy. And George W. Bush was very proud about this one point. He took credit for toppling Jay Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here are some of the rules for tonight's debate. No back-of-the-head camera television angles, no reaction shots of audience members during the debates. You can bring your own make-up people. Coincidentally, these are also the rules for a Paris Hilton sex video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, will be celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary this weekend. Isn't that sweet? That's right. Yeah, Bill said it's going to be a romantic weekend with dinner and a movie and then, later, he'll give Hillary a call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last time John Kerry did a town hall meeting -- true story -- a woman in the audience told him he was hot. Then, she told Kerry that she needs health care so she can afford a pair of glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over half of adults in the United States say that they get their news about the presidential election from the Internet. Not surprising, the most popular website is 'Swift Boat Veterans for Paris Hilton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say&quot; President Bush and John Kerry &quot;are exhausting, but I went to record&quot; the debate &quot;with my TiVo and my TiVo went, 'Do we have to? Isn't a game on? Can't we watch a movie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry looked a little more human than he did in the last debate. Except when he tries to wave to the crowd. Then he gets really stiff, doesn't he? Then he gives that whole Disneyland pirate of the Caribbean wave.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have now come forward and officially conceded that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. In fact, feeling the tremendous relief that came from admitting this, they said there's no Santa Claus, OJ did it, and Al Gore's really been president for the last four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has criticized both Bush and Kerry for belonging to a secret organization when they went to Yale. You know, is Nader one really to criticize? I mean, he belongs to this secret organization, it's called 'Nader for President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard about the big presidential election chaos over there in Afghanistan. Given with how badly they screwed up over there, today Bush declared 'mission accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main polling place is in Kabul, which is an ancient Afghan word, meaning 'Broward County.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you folks go to the Columbus Day parade? A lot of prominent Italian New Yorkers were at the parade. Mario Andretti was the grand marshal of the parade, Rudy Giuliani was at the parade, Hillary Clintoni was at the parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, elections, free elections were held in Afghanistan, that's pretty good. Already, though, there are charges of fraud in Broward and Dade counties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second debate at the request of President Bush, it was the town hall format. ... And also at the request of President Bush, the next one will be the 'happy hour' format.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the third debate is Wednesday night, and this is going to be an exciting one because the jackpot is up to $375,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor going around that President Bush in the first debate had some kind of listening device and somebody was feeding him answers to the questions for the debate. And they actually had a photograph of and there was a bulge in his jacket. I was thinking well, you know, that's an improvement over the last guy who had a bulge in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that amazing? Think about it. Over 100 million Americans will go to the polls, and almost half that number will have their votes counted.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, practicing hard for this one. All day long he's been walking around saying to himself, 'Internet. Internet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush apparently had a hard time getting past reporters and leaving the auditorium in St. Louis last week after the debate. He couldn't get out of the auditorium. Literally, the President -- isn't that amazing? Bush not having an exit strategy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a survey by the Premier Dating Service for Busy Professionals, that's the name of this place, they said 49% of single women said they'd rather go on a date with George Bush, 33% picked Kerry, 15% picked Nader.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with Bush, halfway through the date, he'd choke on a pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of talk in political circles now about amending the US Constitution so people born in other countries can run for president. Apparently, this is part of President Bush's plan to outsource the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute. That seemed kind of mean, didn't it? Who is writing all these Bush jokes? Ellen, put on the camera in the cue card room.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics are now saying that all of the Afghanistan elections weren't totally fair. They were fair enough. Laughter you know, kind of like Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest problem over there was absentee ballots sent in from Afghans that were vacationing in Florida at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cambodia has just created a nine-member panel to create a new king. We have something similar here, it's called the Supreme Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Bill and Hillary's wedding anniversary, and a happy anniversary to them. Married 29 years, 12 of them happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They spent the day quietly, you know, not talking to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, it's like I've always said, marriages are like flowers. The fake ones last the longest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think George Bush is under more pressure&quot; than John Kerry &quot;and I think he is actually starting to feel the pressure, because today he said that he would be willing to stay on until 2009 and then turn things over to Conan O'Brien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The final debate is tomorrow night. The first debate was behind podiums. The second debate was the town hall format. The third and final debate tomorrow night will be the karaoke format.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a photograph of President Bush from the first debate, and he's got some kind of lumpy looking thing in the back of his coat. And the rumors are flying saying it is a special radio receiver and he was getting answer from somebody off stage. Wow, it's like he's back at Yale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, now everybody's going crazy about the bulge in his jacket and I was thinking, you know something like this hasn't happened at the debates since 1996. Remember that, when Clinton had intern under his podium?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. You're all in a good mood. You sound like President Bush when he realized tonight was the last debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, of course, is the third debate. This one asks the most important question of all -- which of these guys do I hate the least?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who won tonight's debate? Anybody that watched baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both candidates, this time, stood in front of podiums. Actually, they couldn't sit down because, as you know, the last debate they lied their asses off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pollsters say this is the closest debate since Ruben beat Clay on 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats are calling George Bush a child of privilege. And they're labeling him the fortunate son because his dad was rich. That's what they're calling him, the fortunate son. As opposed to Kerry, the fortunate husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two rich white guys from Yale, or as we call it, diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another big issue in this campaign has been the separation of church and state. ... How about separating the church and our children? Can we start doing that first?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry took a lot of flack for a statement he made in the New York Times on Sunday. He said we need to get back to when terrorism was not our main focus, just a nuisance, like prostitution. And of course, the Democrats were all over him. They said, 'Hey, since when is prostitution a nuisance?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy weighed in. They said it's not like prostitution. Of course, neither of them have ever been with a terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Florida Governor, Jeb Bush, announced that to avoid any election return problems this year, this time he's going to announce the results before people go in to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, have officially conceded that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Today, the soldiers in Iraq said, 'Can we come home now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest CIA report, Saddam Hussein was developing millions and millions of gallons of flu vaccine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's gas, 3 bucks a gallon here in Los Angeles? See, I feel bad for President Bush. The oil companies are his only economic success story, and he can't brag about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's Wednesday, or as they call it in Bill O'Reilly's office, hump day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it's a big story. A female producer at Fox News has filed a sexual harassment suit against Bill O-O-O-O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She claims he repeatedly talked to her about phone sex and masturbation. The last straw was when he asked if her breasts were fair and balanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, former President Bill Clinton talked about his 29th wedding anniversary that he and Hilary celebrated the other night. Bill says, 'It goes to show you how time flies when you're the one having fun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, he had a romantic evening planned. Flowers, champagne, soft music. No word on what Hillary did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw the third and final presidential debate? How about George Bush, he looked great, he was wearing his three-piece bulge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing George W. Bush did was show everybody that the bulge in the back of his jacket was just his flask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched the debates, and frankly Bush did look confused, at one point he tried to buy a vowel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein had a hernia operation. But don't worry, he should be recovered fully in time for his execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a recent study...people in France have sex 137 times a year. And that doesn't include screwing the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the first debate, the audience couldn't ask questions. During the second debate, the audience could ask questions. And during tonight's debate, the audience got to stay home and watch the baseball game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Schieffer, the moderator of tonight's presidential debate, says that, for the past couple of weeks, people had been coming up to him in airports and suggesting questions. Yeah, which explains why Schieffer's first questions tonight was, 'Would you like to become a Hari Krishna?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the state of Ohio rejected Ralph Nader's attempt to get on the ballot. Yeah, experts say this will hurt Nader's chances of losing all 50 states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton plans to tape a phone message that will be sent to voters' homes, urging people to vote Democrat. He's gonna tape a phone message, yeah. Apparently, you'll know it's Clinton's message because it start with, 'What are you wearing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard there's a new three strikes and you're out policy, but enough about President Bush and the debates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush and Senator Kerry had their final debate last night. They were going after the undecided vote. Unfortunately, the undecideds were watching baseball.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the debate, Kerry is so stern. He looked like a funeral director.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bush was like giddy. Looked like a before and after ad for Prozac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if you are not a fan, you have to admit President Bush did a little better in the third debate. ... See, last night he spoke from the heart. See, the first two debates he tried speaking from the brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry likes to get carried away, too. Like today, he blamed the eruption of Mount St. Helen on President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this? He said, 'If I were president, I would hold a summit of all of the volcanoes of the world Fuji, Etna, Vesuvius, a coalition of volcanoes. They would pass a volcano test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating dropped down to 47%. Remember that lump they said was in his back? Now it's in his throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said to help with the flu vaccine shortage here, he's not gonna get a flu shot. ... Then he coughed and shook John Kerry's hand four times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidates were asked if they thought homosexuality was a choice. And John Kerry said, it wasn't a choice. Good thing for him it's not. I mean, if it were a choice, he'd be going, 'I don't know, maybe, I could.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moderator, of course, was CBS' Bob Schieffer. How old is Bob Schieffer? I believe he was chosen because of the great job he did in the Lincoln/Douglas debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope Martha Stewart didn't watch that debate last night. She must be sitting in prison thinking, 'These guys are running around free and they put me in jail for lying?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US officials announced that Saddam Hussein had hernia surgery two weeks ago. Apparently, he pulled a groin muscle doubled over laughing when he heard we found no weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam was feeling some discomfort, so immediately they check him into the hospital, do the operation and he's made a full recovery. Isn't that ironic? Bush finally comes up with a healthcare plan, it's for Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is taping a phone message to be sent to voters' homes, asking them to vote for John Kerry. It's a recorded message. And like Clinton, if a man answers, it hangs up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called the worst phone sex line in history last night. $2.99 a minute, I wound up talking to Bill O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A female producer at Fox News has filed sexual harassment against Bill O'Reilly, claiming he reportedly talked to her about phone sex, threesomes and masturbation. And of course, the people at Fox News were shocked, they had no idea he was a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a classic case of he said/she said. And since they both work for Fox News, you can't believe either one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the big debate last night, the President and John Kerry? I thought it was a pretty good debate. Both candidates got to dodge a wide range of issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first debate the candidates were on stools. The second debate it was the town hall format. Last night, at President Bush's request it was the open bar format.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush talked about his favorite painting at the White House. He said it inspires him to know that even a dog can draw a straight flush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing Kerry and Bush agreed on was there are too many CSI shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Bush &quot;seem a little confused to you at one point? Because several times during the debate he called out, 'State capitals for $200, Alex.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly is being sued for sexual harassment by a female co-worker. Apparently the last straw was when he changed the name of his show from the 'O'Reilly Factor' to the 'Oh, Baby, Factor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election is now only 19 days away. That's right, 19 days. Which means in 19 days, the most annoying TV ads will be about that guy who's jellin' like Magellan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne, was upset that John Kerry brought up their lesbian daughter. Upset. Yeah, she said, 'The only thing that upsets me more is that I brought up a lesbian daughter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. What a crowd. Man, you sound like Al Franken when he heard about Bill O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman producer at Fox suing Bill O'Reilly for sexual harassment. I guess one of the allegations was he had phone sex with her on a cell phone. That sounds like a bad Verizon commercial, doesn't it? 'Guess what I'm touching now? Good.&quot;&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the allegations, O'Reilly talked to this woman about phone sex and sexual fantasies and vibrators. Bill O'Reilly. It's always the quiet ones, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This woman claims O'Reilly had phone sex with her three times against her wishes. Three times. You know, the first time, maybe. By that second or third call, wouldn't you be looking at your caller ID?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This couldn't happen at a worse time. He's got a children's book. You know he's got a children's book out now, Bill O'Reilly? Do we have a copy of it? Here it is right here. It's called, 'Mommy, why is daddy on the phone so much?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, Mike Wallace had that run-in with the limo driver, and they took him to jail. ... Then, Dan Rather gets caught with a fake memo. Now Bill O'Reilly, being sued for sexual harassment. Do you realize the most trusted newsman in America is now Geraldo Rivera?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did Dick Cheney's daughter say to Bill O'Reilly when he called? 'You got the wrong number.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush boasted the other night that the elections were held in Afghanistan over the weekend. And he said the first voter was a 19- year-old woman. She was also the 7th voter, the 12th voter, the 20th voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people now saying that the questions at the end of the debate the other night actually helped John Kerry 'cause they made him look more human. Well that, and you know, taking the bolts out of his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although Bush said he wasn't getting a flu shot, Kerry got a flu shot yesterday. Did you see that on the news? Kerry got his flu shot. And out of force of habit, the doctor gave him the shot between these two wrinkles in his forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you've heard there's now a flu vaccine shortage. We only have half the amount necessary. How does this happen? How come we never run out of crack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both Bush and Kerry were campaigning in Las Vegas yesterday. You know what would be great? If candidates who went to Vegas, stayed in Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Las Vegas yesterday, John Kerry met with the AARP. They were having their convention. Kerry gave a speech, then Kerry introduced his retirement plan, his wife Teresa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oil has now hit $55 a barrel. Don't we occupy the biggest oil field in the world now? Didn't Michael Moore say Bush had this relationship with the Saudis? Isn't gas supposed to be a nickel now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, at least 11 members of Al Qaeda have disappeared while in US custody. They were in US custody, and now they have completely disappeared. It's almost as if they were starring on the final episode of 'Last Comic Standing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential debates are over. And they are so dull that CBS has ordered 13 more episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're coming down to the elections, and they are just around the corner. And all that really is left now is the last minute tinkering with the voting machines in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry spent the day reaching out to voters that he calls 'persuadable.' Meanwhile, President Bush spent the day reaching out to voters he calls 'persuady-ish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's facing a storm of criticism because during the debate last night, he referred to Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. That got him in trouble. Yet, today, because of the controversy, Kerry cancelled his speech entitled, 'Boy, can those Bush twins drink.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Kerry now blaming President Bush for what's happening with the flu. And Bush, he shot right back. And said, 'Uh, it's pronounced 'Fallujah,' smarty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidates, now they're into their boxing metaphors. That's the big thing. President Bush quoted Joe Lewis by saying, 'You can run but you can't hide.' So, of course, Kerry, he quickly quotes Muhammad Ali when he said, 'Is that all you got?' And, today, Ralph Nader quoted Mike Tyson, 'I'm broke.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they say the campaign is going to get even more negative. Is that possible? Can it get more negative? One side is calling the President a complete idiot. The other side is calling a war hero with a chest full of medals from Vietnam a coward. How can it get more negative than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say America could spend weeks not knowing who's really president, Bush or Kerry. Is that so bad? We spent the last four years not really knowing who's President, Bush or Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a scary thing on the campaign trail on Friday in Cleveland. John Edwards' plane, the takeoff was aborted because of an indicator light. Apparently there wasn't enough electricity for both the indicator light and John Edwards' hair blower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a Bush/Cheney billboard in New Jersey, Dick Cheney's name is spelled wrong. An 'A' instead of an 'E.' His name is spelled wrong. So, apparently, Bush really is in charge of his own campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they began early voting in Florida. And, once again, Al Gore lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early voting was followed by early screw-ups, early intimidation and early lost ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Pennsylvania are now looking for a man who robbed a bank wearing a George Bush mask. You know it wasn't actually George Bush because, apparently, the guy had an exit strategy to get out of the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy was going to wear a John Kerry mask, but he couldn't fit the head through the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Martha Stewart got her first phone call in prison. The bad news, from Bill O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill O'Reilly being accused of sexual harassment from the female producer on his show. She claims they had phone sex, and he claims, no, he's just the victim of a vast right-hand conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First you had Bill Bennett, with gambling -- remember Bill Bennett? Wrote the morals book. Got him on gambling. Rush Limbaugh's on drugs, Bill O'Reilly being sued for sexual harassment. Apparently, being a conservative is a lot more fun than it used to be now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC's Primetime Live -- isn't that a news show? It's basically a news show. Well, they have new poll numbers that show Republicans are more satisfied with their sex lives than Democrats. When did network news start to ask these kind of stupid questions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how cold it is here in New York City, the Bush twins switched from margaritas to Irish coffee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a rough weekend. I had to drive my mom to the Canadian boarder to get her flu shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the flu vaccine shortage, President Bush says he will skip getting his flu shot this year. ... Kerry says he'll just get an extra shot of botox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed this now, both candidates are using fear tactics? It's the last minute in the campaign election and both candidates are using fear tactics. My fear, honest to God, my fear is that one of them will get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, October 19th, which means what, only 15 more voting days left in Florida.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Florida's new slogan, 'Let's screw this one up early,' yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Ralph Nader said today he has no intention of leaving the presidential race. It's not so much he wants to stand, he just has nowhere else to go, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said today that Bush was planning a January surprise if he's reelected. Hey, if we know who's president by January, that will be a surprise, don't you think, at this point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Ohio was arrested after being paid in crack to register voters. You know, it's scary enough the election's gonna be decided by the undecideds. Now it's going to be decided by the undecided crackhead, which is even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A crackhead registering voters. Well, it's nice to see Marion Barry working again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush told a crowd of supporters in Florida that he is the best protection from the draft. No, that is not true. Bush's dad was the best protection from draft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry bought a hunting license in Ohio to appeal to gun owners and hunters. 'Cause he was gonna do a lot of hunting before next week. They he went to a Catholic mass to appeal to Catholics, and then when he campaigned in Appalachia, he told the crowd his wife Teresa was also his first cousin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former CIA Director George Tenet has now become a professor at Georgetown University. The good news, if you're a student, you cut Tenant's class, he won't even find out about it 'til after you graduate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad thing is, he applied to be head of dorm security, but they felt, not qualified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple months ago,&quot; Bill Clinton &quot;had the quadruple bypass heart surgery. I heard today that he is recuperating nicely from his surgery and he spends about ten minutes a day at his desk having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is very confident of being reelected. He is so confident, he brought back the bulge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are already a lot of irregularities in the early Florida voting. You know it's sad when the voting goes smoother in Afghanistan than it does in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Florida, there were computer glitches in the early voting, there were confusing ballots, long lines and chaos. And when President Bush heard about this, he said, 'Mission accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's been accused of using bad grammar to appeal to uneducated voters. 'Cause yesterday, he stopped in a store, and asked, 'Can I get me a hunting license here?' Yeah. After hearing about it, President Bush said, 'It should be, 'Can me get me a hunting license here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton says he's feeling better, and that every day he walks a mile from his house. Yeah, Clinton added that the hard part is sneaking back in without waking Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says that after he gave his speech at the Republican convention, his wife, Maria Shriver, was so mad, she wouldn't have sex with him for 14 days.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was raining so hard, &quot;cars were spinning out of control like President Bush in the debate. It was unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore accused President Bush of using religion to support his Presidency. And, boy, Bush fired back at Gore. He said, 'You're just mad 'cause God made me President.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big speech -- Al Gore ripped President Bush -- he's out of touch. He said Bush intentionally deceived the public about the reasons of going into Iraq. Then, finally, the kid working the counter at Starbucks said, 'Mister, you gonna order coffee or not, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore also said, yesterday, President Bush governed, he governed from a love of power, as opposed to his old boss, who governed from the power of love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in USA Today, Teresa Heinz Kerry said she didn't think Laura Bush was a public school librarian for nine years. You know, Laura Bush was a public school librarian for nine years. And she said she didn't think Laura Bush ever held a real job. That's what she said. Let me tell you something. If you're a librarian and you're married to George W. Bush, there is no harder job on earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry's defenders said, 'Oh, she just says those things once in a while because she's eccentric.' Do you know what eccentric means? Anybody know what it means? It's when someone is crazy, but they're rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Cheneys announced that for the final two weeks of the campaign, their daughter will be straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if Bush had a second term, Dick Cheney could be a candidate in 2008. A lot of people forgot about that. But Cheney says he has no intention of running for president. Three reasons -- one, he'd be too old. Two, health reasons. And, third, he's already been president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early voting has begun in Florida this week. And of course, there are already problems. Yeah, but after waiting two to three hours, many Floridians were shocked to get to the front and realize - 'What, no flu shot! Hey, what's this all about?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know why voters in Florida started voting this week? See, a lot of primitive places like Florida and Afghanistan -- they need a longer time to count the votes. These primitive cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal officials announced today they found another 2.6 million doses of flu vaccine which they will be able to distribute in January. That is, if Bush wins. If he loses, they might accidentally lose them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign is getting heated up, it is really going crazy. John Kerry shook up the whole campaign today, he introduced his own lesbian daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nickelodeon asked children who they would vote for in the presidential election. And the kids picked John Kerry. And President Bush was so angry, he told the kids that tonight they'll get a visit from the 'Boogey Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, one of Iran's top leaders announced that he wants President Bush to win the election. One of the leaders in Iran, yeah. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'You know, for an evil doer, he's not such a bad guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yankee's loss to the Red Sox is &quot;the most embarrassing thing to happen to New York, well, since the Mets. In fact even Hillary Clinton said, 'Does this mean I no longer have to pretend to be a Yankee fan?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health experts today released three tips to avoid getting the flu. Three things you should do -- wash your hands often. Do that. Avoid crowds. Oh, and get elected to Congress. You'll be guaranteed a flu shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress also says that senior citizens will also get a Social Security increase in January. You know, assuming the flu doesn't kill them first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, neither Bush nor Kerry got the flu shot, and both of them said today they're not gonna get one. And Ralph Nader said he's not getting a flu shot, either. Although, in his case, he doesn't really need one, because he doesn't come in contact with any large crowds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard Ralph Nader's latest complaint? He says he's being held back by special interest groups working against him. I think they're called the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Kerry campaign announced today that they will have 10,000 lawyers at polling places in the battleground states. 10,000 lawyers. Boy, let's hope you don't slip and fall outside of a voting booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teresa Heinz &quot;said the other day, she doesn't know if Laura Bush has ever held a real job. The First Lady fired back. She said, 'Hey, she was busy raising three kids, Barbara, Jenna and George W. Okay? That is a full-time job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry went huntin' today. You see that? Killed a goose. He didn't bring his wife Teresa along. He's a little rusty. He wanted to make sure he didn't kill the goose that laid the golden egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll on ABC's Primetime Live...they say Republicans have wilder sex lives than Democrats. Let's see. Now, this survey was done while President Clinton was still in the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is scheduled to campaign for John Kerry next week, but he's still under doctor's orders to take it easy. Doctors told him no girlfriends over 180 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, one of the biggest events in world history. The fall of Castro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Castro says he's okay. He says he's got the best health care in the world right there in Cuba. In fact, he was rushed to the hospital on their fastest donkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed a ballot measure that would spend up to $6 billion in state money on stem cell research.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC has dropped the Miss America pageant, leaving the pageant without a major network for the first time in 50 years. And John Kerry immediately blamed President Bush for making Miss America go it alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turner Broadcasting now is casting for a new reality show called 'The Real Gilligan's Island.' They're looking for a real life Mr. and Mrs. Howell, a real Skipper and a real Gilligan, which, you know, we kind of have that. I mean, John and Teresa are perfect for Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry went hunting for geese in Ohio, but President Bush said Kerry only did it for the photo-op. Yeah, the weird part is, Bush said this while wearing a flight suit while standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, voting in the presidential election started two weeks early. Senior citizens are already reporting problems with the voting machines. Yeah, apparently the seniors are confused because when they pull the lever, no quarters come out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush announced today, we do not have a shortage of flu vaccine. He says what we have is a surplus of patients who want it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry's campaign slammed Dick Cheney for getting a flu shot. A Republican spokesman called the criticism 'ridiculous.' He said, 'If anyone deserves the vaccination, it's the most powerful man on...I mean, the Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney did get a flu shot this week. But it was by accident. He did not intend to get one. What happened was, he was at the hospital having a heart attack, and he fell on a tray full of needles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said today her husband, former President Bill Clinton, got a flu shot also. Which I'm glad. I think it's good. I mean, if Clinton got the flu, think about it, he could infect hundreds of women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa Heinz Kerry is still taking heat for saying she didn't think Laura Bush ever had a real job. Turns out Laura, you know, was a school teacher and a librarian. And Teresa Heinz Kerry, she used to be a translator. Did you know that? She was a translator for, like, two years. Two years. Hey, Laura Bush has been a translator for the last 25 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems today for John Kerry. Remember that goose he shot yesterday? Turns out it was a lesbian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Kerry campaigned in Wisconsin. He was wearing one of those giant, you know the big cheese heads? Then people realized, 'Oh, that's his regular hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both candidates have campaigned heavily in Florida because it's what they call a swing state. You know the easiest way to win in Florida? Anybody know? Play the Miami Dolphins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Communism has a new slogan in Cuba: 'I've fallen and I can't get up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a reporter asked President Bush if it was fatal, and Bush said, 'No, it's pronounced 'Fidel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a good year for dictators. Saddam is out of power, Fidel Castro broke his knee, George Steinbrenner's Yankees lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor James McGreevey, looking for an apartment, and his wife is now buying a house, after they separated after he announced he was gay. ... I thought this was odd, even though he's moving to a small apartment, he's still keeping the pool boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, I have a busy weekend coming up, you probably knew that. It's my last minute Ramadan shopping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've started voting in Florida. The election is three weeks away, and the early voting in Florida, this gives them an extra two weeks to rig the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They started counting the ballots. Bush now has a slight lead over Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey! If you thought this Halloween was scary, wait until next Halloween when we still won't know who won the election. That's going to be even scarier.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm gonna wait until everyone else in line voting and then sneak in and get a flu shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, tomorrow, it's not who wins that's important, it's the fact that this campaign has finally ended, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hard to believe just one more day and then the Vietnam War is finally over.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, can you figure out these ballot propositions? You know, I am totally confused. You know, we should have one proposition that combines everything in it. We just vote yes or no, you know what I'm saying? Like Proposition 101, which would create property taxes to benefit stem cell research done on Indian casino owners for medical marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told an Ohio reporter that he was unfazed that Osama bin Laden has not been caught. And he said, 'It's only a matter of time until Osama bin Laden is caught.' Well, it better be in the next hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Red Sox victory has even given hope to both the campaigns. Like, it's given hope to John Kerry 'cause he's from Boston. And it's given hope to President Bush because, although they made a lot of errors on the ground, it didn't cost them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Red Sox have broken their curse after 86 years, which is pretty amazing. That means the only one now with an 86-year-old curse of not winning is Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks seen that new Osama bin Laden tape? Kind of scary don't you think? I thought this was nice, in the tape he reminds Americans to see their clocks back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That bin Laden tape actually worked, he's up three points in the latest Zogby poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The polls now show the presidential candidates in a dead heat, and in case of a tie, the presidency, of course, goes to the guy whose brother is governor of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is very confident about the election tomorrow, he's so confident that he's going to win that today he was campaigning in front of a 'Mission Accomplished' banner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow's election should be very exciting, especially at the White House. Here's what's going to happen at the White House, every time a state is called for Bush, the twins will do a shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Thank you. You sound like Hillary Clinton when she heard that John Kerry had lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we go any further, I want to say to our viewers in Florida, was that so hard? Huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has not been a good 24 hours if you're a gay John Kerry supporter who planned to get married this weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like people are giving Bush and Cheney four more years. The bad news, Cheney's doctors only gave him two more years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Cheney on the news? I have never seen him so happy. I mean, he was actually yelling out his hotel window, 'I've got a lesbian daughter!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you've got four more years to capture bin Laden. No hurry now. Yeah, take your time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so much for the debates, huh? Bush is going, 'I prepared too much.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry conceded today. He would have conceded earlier in the day, but he had to meet with the French, the Germans and Russians first. Get their feeling on the whole situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very good concession speech. Very emotional for John Kerry. He said he would like to wrap us up in his arms and give us each a big hug. Great, now he starts campaigning like Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, Kerry did not take it good. I understand he was upset all night last night. In fact, he spent all night tossing and turning in his tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to feel a little sorry for Kerry. Not only did he lose the presidency, he was really looking forward to having Teresa move into one of his houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teresa, oh, man, she was so upset about the results of this election, today she raised the price of ketchup to $50 a bottle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you, what is Dan Rather doing? What is he doing, the Hee- Haw election update?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was really sweating this one because he knew if Kerry had been elected president, he probably would order Bush to go to Iraq and make up the rest of his National Guard service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13% of all the voters in Florida this year were first-time voters. Actually, maybe they did vote four years ago, this is just the first time the vote was counted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voter turnout, very low in Beverly Hills. You know why? No valet parking, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is toughest on the campaign staff. The staff workers. Like for the Kerry staff, the biggest problem was fighting uncertainty. For the Bush staff -- fighting doubt. And, of course, the Ralph Nader staff -- fighting loneliness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has still not conceded. Apparently, there's still some absentee ballots coming in from Jupiter and Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, DC, our friend, former Mayor Marion Barry, elected to the city council. The crack is back, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Time magazine, Osama bin Laden's brother, Yeslam bin Laden, said that he has a hard time buying airline tickets. Really? Gee, I can't imagine why. Maybe if he changed his name to maybe like Ahmed bin Laden, maybe that would help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton's presidential library opening next month. A spokesman said Mr. Clinton wants the building to be an interactive center for young Americans. You know, kind of the way the Oval Office was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was walking through Central Park today on my lunch hour, and I saw a squirrel doing a manual recount of his nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell that the election is finally over, moments ago the hookers left Democracy Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is thrilled. Today he was wearing his happy sneer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself, John Kerry now is in big trouble, he really, really, really has to do well in tonight's debate, or that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry, remember a couple weeks ago he was in Ohio and he went duck hunting, remember? I think that probably hurt John Kerry, because Bush easily carried the duck vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You gotta feel bad for John Kerry because now he'll have to go back to his life of being a Senator, a wind surfer and a billionaire. So that's too bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry did say he was sorry that he lost the election because he was looking forward to spending less time with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks in Ohio, the crooked voting machines are due back in Florida by Friday, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conservatives are very happy about the Bush victory. Yeah, when Bill O'Reilly heard about it, he said, 'I haven't been this excited since -- well, you know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his concession speech this afternoon, John Kerry said he is so grateful he wishes he could hug every one of his supporters. ... After hearing this, Ralph Nader said 'Actually, I was able to hug all of my supporters. One, two and three.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During NBC's genius election coverage, a giant map of the United States was painted on the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink. ... The states were painted red when President Bush won -- blue when John Kerry won -- and yellow when Tim Russert had to relieve himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts said that this year's Florida was Ohio. As a result, this year's spring break is expected to suck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marion Barry was elected overwhelmingly as a city councilman in Washington, DC. After hearing this Marion Barry said, 'Wait, aren't I the same guy that was caught smoking crack?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. You sound like Al Gore when he realized he finally had someone now to go to lunch with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see how happy President Bush was yesterday when he found out he won? I mean, he couldn't decide when to give a victory speech or announce the invasion of Iran.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GOP did so well, the only Republican without a 'mandate,' Dick Cheney's daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said yesterday in an American election, there are no losers. Earth to John!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush received a very gracious concession call from John Kerry and got a very gracious collect call from Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Ralph Nader's concession speech? He actually gave it at a concession stand. A couple of people around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you wish these politicians would get real, just say what they really think? I mean, the election is over. Wouldn't it be great if Kerry just said, 'I want to thank everyone who voted for us. I want to thank our campaign volunteers, our friends, our family and most importantly to the state of Ohio, you really suck!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats were really upset yesterday. I haven't seen Michael Moore this angry since he tried to buy a single seat on Southwest Airline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the ironic thing about this election, do you realize the Electoral College is the only college Bush has ever done well in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's got to be hard for John Kerry. You know what's got to be tough about losing a presidential election, that last day of Secret Service protection. I mean, do you even get them for the whole day? Like mid- afternoon you come walking out of the Seven-11. 'Fellows? Bob? Larry? Hey, hey!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Party is now in charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court. You know how they got there? They got there by saying liberals control everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For people who think this is most exciting presidential race in history, three words: Arnold versus Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor that Attorney General John Ashcroft will resign before the inauguration. Well, the White House feels that since Bush is going to swear to defend the Constitution, they want to make sure it's still around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ashcroft says he wants to take time off to spend more time with the voices in his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, is Thursday, November 4th. This is the day all of the people in favor of legalizing marijuana showed up at poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky voters voted to ban gay marriages in Kentucky unless the two people are siblings, then it's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden released another video. Bin Laden bragged that he will bankrupt the United States, and today President Bush said, 'Hey, two can play that game, pal!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's brother, Yeslam, I think that's what his name is, is coming out with his own perfume. I'm not making this up. This is it right here. It's called 'Camel Number 5.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the birthday of the cash register. The cash register was invented today, so that means two days in a row, Republicans are celebrating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some interesting statistics about the election, 11 states voted to ban gay marriages. Three states voted to ban men's figure skating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself, John Kerry is in big trouble now. He must win in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri or it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was a rough campaign. Now the Kerry daughters are drinking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is Hillary Clinton is running for president in 2008. Yep. And here's why people think that. Today she was in Ohio duck hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, the election is over. The first thing this morning President Bush was back at his desk, ignoring intelligence memos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Bush's address yesterday afternoon? Very excited, wasn't he? Very excited. He was thrilled. It was like he never won a presidential election before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who is really happy is Dick Cheney. He went crazy. He celebrated last night. He took his daughter to a strip club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When John Kerry called President Bush to concede the election, the call apparently lasted less than five minutes. And the phone call would have been even shorter, but for the first three minutes, President Bush was talking from the wrong end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, President Bush called his victory over John Kerry historic. ... The President said it's the first time in history only 49% of Americans opposed my presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On election day, a young boy in the South was kicked out of a polling place because he was wearing a John Kerry T-shirt. Yeah, yeah, later, the child was led back in when they realized it was John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twice as many people watched Tom Brokaw's coverage of the election on NBC than watched the coverage on Fox News. Apparently, the ratings for fox news would have been higher, but Bill O'Reilly kept asking women if he could poll them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What an excitable crowd. Boy, you sound like President Bush after realizing he never has to debate anybody ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced another round of tax cuts. Not for the whole country, just Ohio.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of sad. John Kerry went windsurfing today and nobody cared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry has lost his Secret Service protection. Yeah, it's gone. But he still has his wife's Brinks' truck guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a reporter asked President Bush if his agenda would be bipartisan. And he said, 'I thought I made it clear, I'm against gay marriage'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they have a new puppy at the White House, Ms. Beasley. They have another Scottish terrier named Barney. And, of course, the British lap dog named Tony.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Attorney General John Ashcroft, he's going to resign. Yeah, he says he wants to devote more time to covering up naked statues in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love autumn, folks? It's fantastic. Autumn is the time of year that all the states turn red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the election, rumors in Washington are starting to fly. They say Attorney General Ashcroft may be stepping down. Apparently he wants to spend more time spying on his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry was seen enjoying a three point concession bounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is very sorry he didn't run. He was watching Kerry and said, 'That could have been my concession speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was re-elected, and today he hit the ground vacationing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election night, Bush only got two hours of sleep. But don't worry, he'll nap through the intelligence briefing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that he now has a clear mandate. Coincidently, a clear 'man date' is what Governor McGreevey is looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today -- this is the latest -- former President Clinton gave his two cents. He said -- this is a quote - 'Democrats shouldn't sit around and whine about the election.' That's what he said. Yeah. Yeah, instead, Clinton said Democrats should use the election as an excuse to ask for pity sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends of John Kerry say he has been extremely depressed after losing the election this week. In fact, Kerry is so down; he hasn't been able to leave any of his houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people had a rough week last week. It was an especially rough week if you were a gay, pro choice stem cell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush thanked those who worked hardest for his reelection -- Ralph Nader and Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his press conference the other day, President Bush said he felt the people had spoken. That's what he said, the people had spoken. And ironically, most of the people speak better than he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You got to feel sorry for John Kerry, you know? He came this close to finally getting his own house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the Bush Administration said yes, there is still a shortage of flu vaccine, but only in the blue states. Now, what does that mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last two days, Hillary Clinton has gotten over 5,000 phone calls urging her to go on the road for the next four years and run for president. Most of the calls were from Bill in the other room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a brief update on Yasser Arafat. Doctors say although he is dead, he is expected to make a full recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, like one French newspaper said today, Arafat is not in a coma, he's just sleeping. Just sleeping, yeah. Yeah, and Ted Williams is just enjoying the air conditioning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Arafat may be brain dead. That's got to be demoralizing to his people, you know what I'm saying? I mean, your leader is brain dead. Thank God that could never happen here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An F-16 fighter jet accidentally strafed an elementary school in New Jersey with 25 rounds of ammunition. Did you see that? Fired on the school. Of course, since it was New Jersey, the kids immediately returned fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Proud to be a gay American New Jersey Governor James McGreevey gave his farewell speech. Do you know the story on this guy? You know, the real reason he's stepping down isn't because he's gay. I don't think people care if he's gay. It's 'cause he's a moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has nothing to do with the fact that he's gay. It's because he got several of his friends -- he got his friends jobs on the state payroll. He got the construction worker job, the Indian chief, the motorcycle guy, the cop. All of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that marathon yesterday? Wasn't that amazing? Yep. The marathon is over. All the runners are finished. It turns out the Republicans won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Was that crazy, the election? You know, friends are now concerned, they're worried about John Kerry, because today he made one last duck hunting trip to Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush says now that he's going to simplify the tax code. Have you heard about this? Only the states that are blue will have to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bushes have a new puppy. Yeah. He selected a new puppy, and the Senate expects rapid confirmation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new puppy's name is Ms. Beasley. And Ms. Beasley will be replacing Barney, who will be moving to the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They thought the puppy had already ruined the Oval Office rug, but it turns out the stain was left over from the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched that new reality show last night, 'Fallujah Extreme Makeover.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Operation 'Phantom Fury' is now under way in Iraq. You know, where are they coming up with names for these missions, you know? Phantom Fury? Is President Bush dipping in his comic book collection now?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A French military strategist said today the attack will not resolve anything. Of course people are shocked. A French military strategist? What the hell is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you saw the footage of Fallujah, I mean, it was unbelievable. Bullets flying through the air, smoke in the sky, people yelling in foreign language. It's like LA with cheaper gas. 82 cents a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says we're making very good progress and they said soon Fallujah will be a red state.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft has resigned. He didn't want to resign but the Bush White House felt he was just too liberal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he figured once New Jersey Governor McGreevey was gone, his job was done.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey Gov. McGreevey &quot;said he was not going to apologize for being a gay American. ... How about apologizing for being a corrupt American, okay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim McGreevey is so tied to corruption, gays are saying he's secretly straight, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember how President Bush says he doesn't read the newspaper? Today, finally got a subscription to the New York Times. No to read, just got the new puppy to paper train.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader has requested a hand recount of all of the ballots in New Hampshire. Ralph Nader. John Kerry does not want a recount, but Ralph Nader...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice thing about a hand recount of all of the Nader ballots is, you can count them all on one hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know there's talk of Hillary Clinton gearing up a network for 2008. Of course, Bill's very excited about it, as he calls her campaign 'The Polar Express.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Yasser 'Weekend at Bernie's' Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arafat's wife is &quot;accusing the people of trying to bury Arafat alive. Al Gore said, 'Hey, I've had that happen. It's scary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Calls are pouring in all around the world for Mrs. Arafat. Jacques Chirac called. He hoped for the best. Blair sent his regards. And Dick Cheney called to ask if Arafat filled out his heart donor card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paramount Studios is blaming the poor performance of the movie 'Alfie' on the election. They say with the conservative mood the country is in, they don't feel they want to see a guy who has slept around a lot. That shows you how times change. Remember the 90s? We elected Alfie twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been thinking about this all day. Do you think it's too soon to hit on Mrs. Arafat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Palestinian sources, Yasser Arafat is dead but improving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey is stepping down this weekend. He says he wants to spend more time embarrassing his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor McGreevey is looking back on his greatest achievements while in office. He cites environmental reform, very proud of that, improving education and replacing those hideous drapes in the governor's mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier right here, the 38th annual Country Music Award show. It turned out to be another heart-breaking loss for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is already talking about running in 2008. He's going to make some changes, for example, Kerry will be replacing Teresa Heinz Kerry, his wife, with Diane Keaton for 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush and &quot;the family get a brand-new dog. The dog's name is Ms. Beasley. Coincidentally, our last president also had a dog that would lick him under the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS aired the 38th annual Country Music Awards. Yeah, apparently, 51% of Americans watch the Country Music Awards, and the other 49% voted for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, guys. You all sound like the naked statues when they heard John Ashcroft resigned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Ashcroft has stepped down from his position as Attorney General. Yeah, he said he wants to spend more time not dancing with his wife.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commerce Secretary Don Evans, he also resigned. Evans said he doesn't want to resign, but when the country doesn't have any more commerce, you don't need a secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, that's two major Cabinet positions that have left. It's pretty amazing, isn't it? Actually people in the Bush Administration with an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;French doctors say that Yasser Arafat's condition has dramatically worsened. Which is pretty bad, because a couple of days ago, they said he was dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, what they said was, instead of looking like Ringo Starr, he now looks like Keith Richards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Palestinians are accusing Arafat's wife of only being interested in Arafat's money. And John Kerry today said, 'Hey, leave the poor woman alone. Give her a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is considering running again in 2008. Then, you know, he could change his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Al Gore '04 Website, it was always Al Gore in '04. That was the name of his Website. Well, yesterday, it changed to Al Gore, 2008. Al Gore's thinking of running in 2008. So, it could be, you could go for the nomination Al Gore versus Hillary. Imagine that debate? Two people who spent their entire lives trying to get out from under Bill Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Pennsylvania Avenue...reopened yesterday for the first time to pedestrians. But President Bush got a little confused. He said, 'You know, it should be open to people of all religions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Madonna on the news today? Madonna said we should pull all of our troops out of Iraq. Today, Donald Rumsfeld said, 'Well, we're going to wait and hear what Britney Spears has to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein announced today he does not he does not want to be tried by the Iraqi people. He wants to be tried by the Scott Peterson jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actress Renee Zellweger said today she wants to take time off from acting for a while, just to be a girl. I'm sorry, that was the Governor of New Jersey.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Late Show. My name is Dave Letterman. I'm your new hard ass Attorney General.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft has resigned, but he said he is proud of his record. 3,000 arrests, no indictments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commerce Secretary Don Evans has also resigned. This really took Bush by surprise. He had no idea we had a Commerce Secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yasser Arafat is not dead, but he may not be well enough to attend his own funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reports that Ralph Nader is demanding a recount of all his ballots in New Hampshire. ... A New Hampshire official agreed and said, 'One, two. Yeah, it's two.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, what a crowd. You sound like Yasser Arafat's wife after she heard he had $1 billion stashed away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, Yasser Arafat died last night. This time, it looks pretty permanent, yes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was turning into Kenny on 'South Park.' Oh, he's dead again. Oh, he's back. Oh, he's dead again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was he was in the hospital in Paris for over three weeks. And his dying wish, that his bill be sent to the Israelis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arafat's wife was seen grieving today in the West Bank. She's also grieving in the Citibank, the Mellon Bank, Wells Fargo Bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said Arafat's wife had not even seen him in four years. That's got to be tough, being married to a terrorist, don't you think? Every five minutes, 'Honey, have you seen my anthrax?' 'It should be in the container near the nerve gas, where you left it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palestinian officials said that Arafat's body will be transported in a bullet-proof container. You don't want to shoot a dead guy, whatever you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that the United States will be more than willing to help the Palestinians establish their own state, as long as it was a red state.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, boy. First, Ashcroft resigns. Now Arafat is dead. This has not been a good week for religious radicals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I'm a believer in that 'uniter, not a divider' philosophy. For example, like, if John Ashcroft if he had reached out to the gay groups, they could have worked together. Like, they could have dressed the nude statues in really fashionable clothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. It looks like we're making quick progress over there in Iraq. In fact, today in Fallujah, they banned gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fallujah is now 70% under control. Which is pretty good, considering LA is only 60% under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I've always wondered about the women of Fallujah. Are they called 'Fallusies?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yet another person was kicked off the Scott Peterson jury. This is the third one, and it was a foreman this time. ... Can you imagine that? Five months worth of work down the drain. Today, John Kerry said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a year of repair, Pennsylvania Avenue right in front of the White House has been reopened. Yeah. However, it will remain closed to John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know by now, Yasser Arafat is dead. Damn, just when the peace process was going so well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was touching. At Arafat's bed there in the hospital in Paris, just before he passed away, Mrs. Arafat leaned down very close to him and whispered three words: 'Where's the money?&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But calls were coming in from all over the world to Mrs. Arafat. Tony Blair, for example, called and expressed his sympathy. Vladimir Putin, he sent his condolences. Bill O'Reilly called, Bill O'Reilly. He asked what she was wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has selected Alberto Gonzales to be his new attorney general. Alberto Gonzales, yeah. Yeah, there was one awkward moment when Bush asked if he was related to Speedy Gonzalez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Controversial Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat passed away. In the Middle East, thousands of Palestinians showed their respect by flying flags at half-mast and throwing rocks underhand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news from the Middle East. Israel said today they are finally ready to sit down and negotiate with Yasser Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arafat died earlier this week in Paris. And in lieu of flowers, the Arafat family has asked everyone, please just throw rocks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Arab countries are very upset about who we sent to Arafat's funeral. They said we did not show enough respect. 'Cause, you know, Bush didn't go. And Vice President Cheney didn't go. Secretary of State Colin Powell, he didn't go. You know who we sent to represent the United States? Anybody know? Carrot Top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Blair met with President Bush at the White House today. Did you see the two of them speaking together? ... They looked like a before and after commercial for 'Hooked On Phonics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madonna has called for US troops to pull out of Iraq. That shows you how time's changed, huh? I remember the good old days when people used to call the US troops to pull out of Madonna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush nominated Alberto Gonzalez to be the next Attorney General of the United States. I'll say, little Alberto, he has come a long way since he lost his mother trying to get here from Cuba, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said he will push to have a constitutional amendment stating that marriage is to be between a man and a woman. Bush said this is his mandate to prevent 'man dates'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who might run for [president in] 2008? Hillary Clinton. That's right, Hillary Clinton. Her husband, Bill, is so excited he's already interviewing White House interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15 years ago this week, the Berlin Wall came down. 15 Years ago. Yep. Politically speaking, I believe this was the biggest thing to go down until -- well, Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palestinians said an emotion farewell to their former leader, Yasser Arafat. That's right. A spokesperson for the Palestinians said, 'We haven't been this upset since last week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy I tell you, I watched 'Extreme Makeover' today. But enough about the Bush White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Bush had a Cabinet meeting. Just him and Cheney, that was it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard this story. Today, President Bush had his 'Colin' removed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell submitted his letter of resignation. Yeah, yeah. Actually, he submitted it six months ago, but Bush didn't get around to reading it until today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney rushed to the hospital after experiencing a shortness of breath. I guess he panicked when he saw the price of oil starting to go down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he's fine now. Luckily, doctors gave him a donor heart that's good for the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, 'Old Dirty Bastard' has died. But enough about Yasser Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Arafat's funeral on the news? What a mob scene that was. I mean, they had people flying in from as far away as Guantanamo Bay to go to that thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The temporary successor to Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas...escaped a shooting by militants as he was visiting Arafat's grave. See, that's why he's called a 'temporary successor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Thursday, Bill Clinton will dedicate his new presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas. ... One of the most popular attractions -- you'll be able to ride the mechanical intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the program. Folks are here on a great night. The entire balcony here in the Ed Sullivan Theater is filled with outgoing members of the Bush Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colin Powell and three other Cabinet members resigned today. And President Bush says it proves that he's winning the war against his own staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this just in: Yasser Arafat is still clinging to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arafat funeral went pretty well. Only 30 people were killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a tough week for Mrs. Arafat. She's so distraught she can barely shop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But at the funeral itself, there were riots. There were people sobbing. There were guns firing. It's the same reaction I got when I hosted the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened over the weekend? Dick Cheney, they rushed him to the hospital. ... And don't kid yourself, it was serious. For a few minutes, President Bush was actually in charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Thursday the presidential, Clinton Presidential Library opens up on Thursday in Arkansas. It's a wonderful facility. It's a state-of-the-art library. In fact, visitors will be able to get a virtual Lewinsky.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Secret Service has now doubled guards around the White House. They doubled the number of guards. Not to keep people out, to keep more of Bush's Cabinet people from escaping. They are trying to sneak out everywhere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe how many -- you know, I haven't seen this many secretaries running from the Oval Office since Clinton was in there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And contradicting earlier reports, Homeland Security director Tom Ridge said reports that he is stepping down are news to him. That's what he said. They're news to him. Why is the homeland security guy always the last to know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kind of ironic, the only cabinet member whose heart is still in it, Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, President Bush chose Condoleezza Rice to replace Colin Powell as Secretary of State. And I think President Bush is a little confused. He's looking forward to seeing a lot more of her and Stedman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's now talk in some political circles of amending the United States Constitution so Arnold Schwarzenegger could run for President. They're actually running ads here in California, testing the waters to see if people would go for that. In fact, I saw one last night. Our constitution currently prohibits foreigners from becoming President. But what would be so wrong with President Schwarzenegger, President Banderas or President Madonna?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember, just 'cause someone talks funny, doesn't mean they wouldn't make a good President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Maybe you heard about this down in Washington yesterday, a man tried to jump the White House fence. However, good thing he was knocked back over by fleeing Bush Cabinet members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Big shake-ups in the Bush White House. I don't know. It's hard to picture the Bush administration without Spencer Abraham, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell has resigned and will be replaced by Condoleezza Rice, and it is her job now to make sure to keep world hating us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But President Bush had high praise for Condoleezza Rice. He said she is one of our greatest Condoleezzas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush announced today that Condoleeza Rice will replace Colin Powell as Secretary of State. When asked why he was leaving, Powell said, 'I want to see what it's like to be ignored in the private sector'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;He's okay now, but Dick Cheney, he went to the hospital this weekend. He's fine now, but he went to the hospital after experiencing shortness of breath. Yeah. The doctors asked Cheney when he first noticed this, and he said, '1972.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how many of you watched that new reality show 'I'm a cabinet member, get me outta here!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Bush's Education Secretary, Rod Paige, he's out. He's a big force behind that program Leave No Child Behind. Before he left, he introduced the President's new program, 'Hey Kid, You're On Your Own.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said he was sorry to see Rod Paige leave. He said 'He learned our kids real good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Colin Powell said no one should be surprised that he's leaving, because he always told President Bush that he always thought he'd only serve one term and Bush said 'me, too!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an important announcement. President Bush announced he will not be burying anymore nuclear waste in the state of Nevada. He's not going to bury anymore nuclear waste -- or as he said 'nukelar' waste -- in Nevada. He said he will bury it in a blue state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the day that President Bush was going to pardon the presidential turkey. You know, he does it every year. It's symbolic. Before he could pardon the turkey, he had actually resigned. Everybody is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Colin Powell has resigned and Condoleezza Rice is replacing him, and in 2009, she will replace Jay Leno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of weird because Bush wins the election and now everybody is leaving. As a matter of fact, the Bush twins have been replaced by the Hilton sisters. Not a bad deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess we know what happened in Little Rock, Arkansas, at the opening of the Clinton Presidential Library. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big ticket there. President Bush was there. He raised six and a half million dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was excited to be there because he had never been to a library before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The library itself is state-of-the-art. When you take a tour of the library, they have an exact replica of the Oval Office, and it's complete with an animatronic Hillary throwing a lamp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was there. When they told President Bush it was gonna be a gala event, he said, 'Well, none of them are going to be getting married, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, things are pretty quiet at the White House today. Well sure, nobody left. They've all been fired, they all quit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big gossip in Washington, DC, these days is all about President Bush kissing his Cabinet secretaries. You know about this? First, he kissed Condoleezza Rice twice on the cheek. Then he kissed his new Education Secretary, Margaret Spellings, right on the lips. Is that unbelievable? One day, Bush goes to the Clinton library, comes back 'The Tongue.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you saw the opening of the library. It rained on Bill Clinton's parade yesterday, which is kind of a switch. Usually, Hillary does that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security was tight. In fact, I understand Bill Clinton frisked each woman personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the library? It's really something. They said the most popular attraction is the viewing booths where you pay a quarter and you get to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton library &quot;is totally transparent, except the Clinton apartment, which is on the top of the library. ... Shouldn't it be the other way around, you know? Shouldn't the Clinton apartment be transparent? See, that would be the attraction, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because you know, Hillary's going, 'I know what's going on in the library, I want to know what's going on in the apartment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess there are two sections to the library. There's the smaller wing to the left of the building, and the larger area, which they call the vast right wing. That's off to the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, he gave a speech at the library, and told a story about how he was shocked to learn Bill and Hillary first met at the Yale University library. He was shocked because he went to Yale for four years, didn't even know they had a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry told Geraldo Rivera &quot;that he lost the election because of that last-minute Osama bin Laden tape. ... See, that's not a good sign. You know what I'm saying? After a year of campaigning, people still prefer bin Laden's speech over John Kerry's speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton's presidential library opened yesterday, and it costs $7 to get in. That's a fact, $7. Yeah, on the bright side, every night is ladies' night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
