<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Hillary Clinton. She was the big winner in West Virginia last night,&quot; with 67% of the vote versus &quot;26% for Barack Obama,&quot; who &quot;hasn't had numbers that low since the last time he went bowling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell Hillary was kind of pandering to voters in West Virginia. Like today, she promised if elected, she would impose a heavy tax on anybody with teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but, hey, give her credit. Hillary Clinton is living proof of the American dream. Think about it. If you work hard and really put your mind to it, you can watch someone else become president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for Hillary. Just a few hours ago, John Edwards announced he will be endorsing Barack Obama. Well, the rumor is that Barack Obama promised him, if elected, he would offer him the cabinet position of secretary of Shampoo and Highlights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although, Hillary Clinton...was quick to point out Dennis Kucinich still has not endorsed anyone yet. Still on the fence there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Hillary is doing badly in the delegate count, but she's so far behind, her Secret Service code name is now NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a survey in 'US News &amp; World Report,' 32% of Americans think John McCain is too old to be president. When they told John McCain about this, he said, 'Huh?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Energy Department said today that gas prices will peak next month at $3.75 a gallon, which surprised a lot of people. We actually have an Energy Department? Hey, where is it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean on the show tonight. ... Now, anybody here from Florida or Michigan? All right. You can't be seated. You'll have to leave. I'm sorry. It's the Democrats' ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Howard Dean was once the biggest Internet phenomenon until that 'leave Britney alone' guy came out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Israel...today. He is there looking for knishes of mass destruction.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was in town this morning, John McCain. Do you like John McCain? He was on...the 'Regis and Kelly' program this morning. And I don't know, maybe he was tired,&quot; but he &quot;seemed a little confused. He kept calling Regis, 'Maury.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the reason. The day before, John McCain was in the Pacific Northwest, and one of the things he did, he strolled through a redwood forest.&quot; And &quot;you know what, folks? He was the oldest thing in the forest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Democratic presidential campaign? Don't you want it to stop?&quot; And &quot;the election is what, three years away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And once they finish up in the United States, then they go to Mexico and campaign. They'll be campaigning in Mexico for another six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary won big in West Virginia, but...her campaign is broke. They're out of money&quot; and &quot; $21 million in debt. ... And here's how desperate it is. Today, Hillary is so broke, she was shopping at Bob's Discount Pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night,&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;won the West Virginia primary with nearly 70% of the vote. ... Yeah, apparently, Hillary would've gotten even more votes from the West Virginians, but on the way to the polls, some of their houses got a flat tire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain, of course, no one is really paying attention to him right now, but he's everywhere trying to get attention. Yesterday on 'Live with Regis and Kelly,' John McCain showed one of his baby pictures. That was nice. Yeah, the picture was on loan from the Museum of Natural History.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of scary to be on TV nowadays because you never know when you might get eliminated,&quot; as happened to Syesha on &quot;American Idol.&quot; Her name now &quot;takes its place among other notable third-place winners, like Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama in the West Virginia primary last night. She raked in 20 of the 28 delegates for West Virginia, which means now she has even more of no chance to win this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if there was any doubt that Barack Obama has what it takes to be a president of the United States, that doubt was erased during a campaign stop in Oregon,&quot; when he mistakenly said he had been to 57 states. So he is &quot;definitely ready to take over for President Bush.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;needs rest. Some crazy lady keeps calling him at 3:00 a.m. every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. 101 degrees today in Los Angeles. Man. People were sweating like President Bush when he heard gay marriage was legal in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge political fireworks today after President Bush went to Israel and he talked about American politicians who might want to talk with Hamas or other leaders. Politicians who would sit down and appease terrorists. He said he would not do it. He would not put up with it. He would never talk to terrorists. And then he flew to Saudi Arabia to spend a couple of days with the Saudi royal family.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story in politics is that John Edwards has officially endorsed Barack Obama. They say the endorsement will help Obama win what's known as Hillary Democrats. Do you know what those are? Hillary Democrats? Those are Democrats that like to knock back whisky shots while pretending to duck sniper fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are saying, there could be an Obama-Edwards ticket. Others think there should be an Obama-Hillary ticket. And today, the former governor of New Jersey, Jim McGreevey, said, 'Hey, why not a three-way?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I don't think Hillary gets that it's over. Did you see her today campaigning with the immunity necklace from 'Survivor' around her neck?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, in an interview, Hillary Clinton said that her comment about getting the support of white voters, remember, she said she had the support of white voters. She now says that was one of the dumbest things she's ever said -- well, that and when she turned to Bill and said, 'I do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government, our Federal Government, has dropped out of having American students compete in the international competition that compares math students. Is that unbelievable? We're not in it anymore. President Bush spoke about it today. He said, 'Foreign students are simply gooder at mathesizing than we are.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox is coming out with a new show called 'Secret Millionaire,' where a group of super rich people go out and try to blend in and befriend residents in poor neighborhoods for ten days. Didn't we just have this show? It was called the Democratic primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, I mean God bless her, and it looks like now there is no possible way she can win the nomination. So she's not dropping out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because you know, West Virginia earlier this week she won big, won like no delegates but still she won big. And then now they go to South America and they continue the campaign in South America. Just keeps going and going and going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her campaign is $21 million in debt. $21 million in debt. So her campaign is the world's most expensive fantasy camp. Look at it that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary thinks there is a chance. She is counting on her stimulus check to keep her going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's sad because she's doing anything she can to raise money. Earlier today I saw her outside with a sign wearing a sign that read, 'Will drop out for food.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But finally some good news for Hillary. ... And a bit of strategy now that I think could make Hillary Clinton unstoppable. Today, listen to this, today a wealthy industrialist, a wealthy industrialist built her an iron pant suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama had to apologize for calling a reporter sweetie. Yeah, meanwhile, Bill Clinton apologized for calling a reporter when her husband was home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in an interview with Katie Couric, Hillary Clinton said that she would not quit, no matter how bad her numbers looked. Yeah. Yeah, then Katie Couric said the same thing to Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was just in Saudi Arabia, meeting with King Abdullah. I think he gets a little confused. He kept saying, 'So where's Paula Abdul?' I don't think he understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he got employee of the month while he was over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea of how low of President Bush's approval rating is, during the flight of Air Force One to the Middle East, they made him sit in the bathroom the entire way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was in Israel, President Bush launched a political attack on Barack Obama. I guess he attacked him over there, so he doesn't have to attack him over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, today, Barack Obama responded to that attack, and then McCain attacked Obama, and then Obama fired back at McCain, and then Hillary Clinton said, 'Hello! Will somebody attack me? I'm still in the race! 'Hello, I'm still here! Anybody, attack me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, things are not looking good for Hillary. In fact, today, she was thinking of changing her name to Gas Prices just to see her numbers go up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it's getting crazy. I mean, it's like 4 bucks ? it's well over $4 a gallon here in California. To give you an idea of how expensive gas is, earlier today, I saw Amy Winehouse injecting it between her toes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was on this day in 1911, that the US Supreme Court ordered the breakup of Standard Oil Company, claiming it was a monopoly and violated the anti-trust laws. Yeah, they broke it up, which was kind of sad because, as you know, the oil industry never really recovered from that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...Osama bin Laden has issued a new video. You can get it Nutflix, if you want to order it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Senator John Edwards has endorsed Barack Obama. This is important, because his only other previous endorsement was, of course, for Crest Whitestrips.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, since the Edwards endorsement, all eyes are on Al Gore now. Ooh, who's Al Gore going to endorse? And analysts think Gore will jump on the Obama bandwagon. Have you seen the size of Al Gore lately? That could be the end of the bandwagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the other day, John McCain made a speech about what things will be like five years from now. See, normally, a guy that age starts talking about the next five years, the word 'assisted-living' usually comes up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, chemicals in pizza box liners and soft drinks can lead to obesity. I believe these chemicals...are called pizza and soft drink, okay? Who doesn't know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists now say they can calculate the probability of an earthquake within 24 hours in California. ... Although, they said, it's not really that useful for predicting the first quake, but they can predict after shocks. Hey, don't do me any -- I can predict aftershocks, okay? You know when they happen? Right after an earthquake, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Barack Obama gave a speech in South Dakota. At the end of the speech, the crowd gave him a standing ovation. Yeah, very cool, yeah. Obama got the standing ovation not for his speech, but for being the first black person in South Dakota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Barack Obama, I guess he's having his differences with President Bush. Barack Obama says that President Bush refusing to meet with Iran's president would have been like Richard Nixon refusing to meet with Mao Tse-Tung. Yeah. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'Look, if he's going to make people up ? that's just not fair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Supreme Court ruled that it is legal for homosexuals to get married in California. ... As a result, thousands of wedding planners will finally get to plan their own wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Saudi Arabia today for a meeting with King Abdullah. The main reason he went was to ask the Saudis to produce more oil so our gas prices will go down. They said no. So now he's coming home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. ... It was so hot, Hillary Clinton became delusional, began claiming she could win the White House. I'm sorry, that's the regular Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, an estimated 75,000 people attended a Barack Obama rally&quot; on the banks of the Willamette River. And &quot;if you believe the media, listen to this. After the rally, Barack Obama fed them all with five loaves of bread and two fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the oldest serving member of Congress, former Klan member Senator Robert Byrd, has endorsed Barack Obama for president. That's got to make Hillary feel good, huh? Even the Klan guy is going, 'I'm gonna go with the black guy.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in response to climate change, Barack Obama said we can't drive our SUVs, keep our houses at 72 degrees, and eat all we want. When Al Gore heard we can't eat all we want, he called Obama a global warming fanatic!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, John McCain spoke about what he hopes to achieve by the end of his first term as president. McCain spoke about his vision, which he said was a little blurry and not good at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain also said the war in Iraq will be over by the year 2013, which is also when I think Hillary is expected to pull out of the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to his tax returns, President Bush has lost money during his Presidency. I think I speak for all Americans when I say, 'Hey! Join the club, pal!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, listen to this. I love this. According to these latest financial disclosures, Dick Cheney is worth somewhere in between $20 million and $100 million. I mean, could they be more vague? Isn't that like an $80 million gap? Apparently, Cheney's accountant is the same guy telling Hillary she still has a mathematical chance of winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush was in Saudi Arabia to mark 75 years of official relations with the royal family, and 40 years of officially being screwed royally by that family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the present the royal family gave President Bush? ... A brand new Schwinn.&quot; That &quot;pretty much says it all, doesn't it? He goes over there looking for solutions to the energy crisis, they give him a bicycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the country of Saudi Arabia is run by the Saudi royal family. Boy, imagine allowing someone to run a country just because his dad ran the country. Thank God, that could never happen here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And NASA says they have developed a $250 million machine for the astronauts that will convert their urine into drinking water. Actually, the machine only costs $900. The rest of the money is spent trying to get people to test it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Yankee first baseman, Jason Giambi, said he wears a gold lame tiger-stripped thong under his uniform to help him get out of a hitting slump.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Schwarzenegger announced a very ambitious environmental goal today. He says by the year 2010, he wants to see Britney Spears crashing a hydrogen car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know by now, the California Supreme Court says gays and lesbians can marry. And President Bush said he won't stop this. Yeah. He said, 'Hey, if you're a gay guy and you want to marry a lesbian, that's fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Kept promoting weekly iTunes terror podcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. He's a little pitchy, dawg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 232 years and not one cookie shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It's just an infomercial for his new 'Lean, Mean Goat Grillin' Machine.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Complains 'Grey's Anatomy' has totally 'jumped the shark.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. He's interrupted three times by the blind sheik yelling, 'Baba Booey!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Background noise suggests he's clearly at a bowling alley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Announced his engagement to Star Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Even he can't believe Bush hasn't caught him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm trying not to be too depressed about this, but how about...the price of gasoline in this country? You know what they're saying now?&quot; By &quot;Labor Day, it will probably be $20 a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Oil is now $125 a barrel,&quot; a &quot;very, very high&quot; price. But &quot;if return the barrel,&quot; you &quot;get a $2 deposit back. So that's not so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, President Bush is back from his trip to the Mideast. And he did accomplish one thing. He found the crystal skull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But while President Bush was in Egypt he did&quot; ride a camel. So &quot;if you are scoring at home, that's three humps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's what's troubling to me. This Osama bin Laden, remember when he was wanted dead or alive? Remember that? That was like eight years ago. And now he is still recording and releasing audiotapes and videotapes. It is not right, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen. In fact, there is a new audiotape from Osama bin Laden and you can tell, you know, you can tell this one is current because in this tape he takes credit for making that guy fly in the JetBlue restroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was shocking. In the new Osama bin Laden tape, bin Laden admit that in the '70s he had an affair with Barbara Walters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks following the presidential campaign? Here is what I think. When will it be over?&quot; Because, &quot;as you know, the election is still three years away. And when they get done, I think the next one is in Kentucky.&quot; Then &quot;they finish up and go to Canada. Then they have the primaries all across Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Hillary Clinton campaign -- this is crazy. They are running out of money fast,&quot; and &quot;it is a serious thing. I mean, as a matter of fact, earlier today a couple of guys repoed her pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton still campaigning hard. In a speech this weekend that she just gave, Hillary Clinton said that John McCain 'couldn't be more out of touch.' Yeah. Yeah, then Hillary said, 'Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about to win the Democratic nomination.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama also going after John McCain. In a speech today, Barack Obama accused John McCain of trying to bankrupt Social Security. ... Yeah, not by voting against it, just by collecting it for 80 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on another hot day. And it was hot again today, wasn't it? ... It was so hot, John McCain narrowed his list of running mates to either Ben or Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is embarrassing. The Federal government has pulled American students out of the international competition that compares math students. They say, these days, there's less emphasis on math,&quot; especially &quot;in the Hillary Clinton campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's&quot; Democratic presidential primaries were held &quot;in Kentucky and Oregon. So you had the Bluegrass State and the Primo Grass State.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is &quot;expected to do well with more affluent, educated voters,&quot; and Hillary Clinton is &quot;expected to win Kentucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton campaigned extensively in Bowling Green, Kentucky, over the weekend. Barack Obama did not campaign in Bowling Green. He doesn't do well in any place with the word bowling in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, Hillary knows how to appeal to those voters. Like, she promised the people of Kentucky, if elected president, she would lower the price of pay-per-view wrestling 50%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama spoke before 75,000 people at a rally in Oregon.&quot; That is &quot;the equivalent of 75,000 Ralph Nader rallies. Do you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Sunday, NASA's latest Mars probe will land on the surface of Mars looking for ice or water. Ice or water? We already have that. Why don't you look for oil, okay? It couldn't cost any more to bring it in from there than what we're paying now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, President Bush is back from his big trip to the Middle East. He went over to Saudi Arabia to talk to them about the high price of gasoline. And while he was there, the price went up eight cents a gallon. Doing a hell of a job, Bushy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when President Bush spoke in the Middle East, he reminded the Saudis that, sooner or later, they'd run out of oil. And they said, 'Yeah, but not before you run out of money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to sue OPEC for limiting oil supplies. ... . Is this going to help bring down the price of oil, bringing in lawyers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest financial forms, President Bush has actually lost money while he's been in the White House. How do you lose money? The house is free, the food is free. Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did he spend the money on? He's not buying books, we know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think it was? ... I think he lost a big bet with Colin Powell over whether there would be weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Prince Charles now claims that they only have 18 months to stop global warming. ... Didn't Al Gore say we had, like, ten years? Now, Prince Charles says 18 months. See, I got to go with Al Gore. I don't know if Prince Charles is a good, reliable source when it comes to global warming, but come on -- this guy thinks Camilla is hot, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. According to the latest medical studies, the chemicals in pizza box liners...can lead to obesity. Let me tell you something, okay?&quot; If &quot;you're eating the liner of the pizza box, you're probably pretty fat already, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Not Going To Win 'American Idol.' &quot;6. Even Dick Cheney thinks what you do is cruel and inhumane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't discount Hillary because she's nothing if not shrewd also. These people are professional politicians. Don't ever forget that. Hillary has a back-up plan. First, nothing but superdelegates. Remember when we heard all about the superdelegates? Now she has another back-up plan to get to the White House. She's going to marry John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's, of course, a big night for all the candidates. Let's get this straight. Hillary Clinton is expected to win in Kentucky. Barack Obama is expected to win in Oregon. And John McCain is expected to win at bingo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Barack Obama visited an Indian reservation. And I don't know if you heard about this,&quot; but &quot;the chief adopted him and gave him the name 'Black Eagle.' ... The chief also gave Hillary Clinton the name 'Runs Even After Losing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has announced that next month, President Bush will be making a trip through Europe. ... Yeah. President Bush says he's really excited to go to Europe, because he's never seen a kangaroo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama got a big endorsement this week. Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who, believe it or not, is a former exulted cyclops of the KKK -- no kidding around -- said he will cast his superdelegate vote for Barack Obama. Not a great time for Hillary Clinton when even former Klan members are supporting Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They held primaries in Oregon and Kentucky.&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;won Kentucky, Obama is expected to win Oregon, which would mean that he would clinch a majority of the pledge delegates. There are the delegates, superdelegates, pledge delegates, Lemon Pledge delegates, and...the farmer in the delegates,&quot; without which &quot;you don't get to the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, on the news earlier tonight, they showed Barack Obama back in Iowa. ... And I got scared. I went, 'Oh, no, we're starting all over again!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, the Democrats had their primaries in Oregon and Kentucky. Do you know what that means? Nothing. It doesn't mean anything. You know, this election is like a bad NBC show. You can't believe it is still on the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as expected, they both won one last night. It doesn't mean anything. Barack Obama won Oregon, and Hillary won big in Kentucky. She beat Barack, what, 65% to 30%. Or as they call it down south, a double wide margin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while in Louisville, Kentucky, they showed Hillary on the news at a mall trying on three or four different pairs of reading glasses with the tags hanging down. ... Apparently, she's having trouble seeing the handwriting on the wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, did you hear Hillary's new campaign slogan? 'Hell, no, I won't go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then John McCain unveiled his new slogan. 'Hey, you, get off my lawn!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Barack Obama visited the Crow Nation, where he was formally adopted into the tribe and given his own Indian name. His Indian name is 'One who helps people throughout the land.' Hillary Clinton also given an Indian name: 'Lady who doesn't know it is over.' And of course, John McCain was given an Indian name: 'Man who fought with Custer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a poll in 'New York' magazine, 85% of New Yorkers consider sex with a prostitute to be cheating. The other 15% were all former governors.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I don't know what to say about this anymore, the presidential campaign.&quot; The &quot;sad thing here is&quot; that the Hillary Clinton campaign is &quot; $21 million in debt. ... And so now, when she gets that 3:00 a.m. Phone call, it's a loan shark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, you've got to hand it to her-- she keeps showing up for the primary. She won...big in Kentucky. The next primary is in Puerto Rico,&quot; and &quot;Hillary is ready for&quot; that one. She &quot;plans to campaign in a skimpy, two-piece pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, this is true, while campaigning in Kentucky, Hillary Clinton stopped at a drugstore and bought a pair of reading glasses. ... Yeah, then she picked up a newspaper and said, 'Holy crap, I've got to drop out of this thing!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Barack Obama, true story, campaigned on an Indian reservation and the tribal chief adopted him. ... Yeah, the Indians actually prefer Obama to John McCain, because they still remember when McCain took their land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month, one of the last Democratic primaries will be held in the state of Montana. ... Barack Obama was expected to win the support of Montana's black voters, but they both moved to Idaho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cook is the &quot;new 'American Idol.'&quot; Cook beat David Archuleta, but &quot;Hillary Clinton called...Archuleta right after the show and told him not to give up and stay in the competition, no matter how long it takes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the difference between 'American Idol' and the Democratic primary?&quot; They &quot;count the votes on 'American Idol' from Florida and Michigan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, yesterday, a group of oil company executives testified before Congress. Oil company executives talking to politicians. I believe they set a record for the most number of lies ever told in one room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the question I would ask these oil company executives. How much profit do you have to make before you have someone clean the restroom, okay? ... You been to an Exxon station?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to CNN, because of the rising price of gasoline, used Geo Metros -- you know those little cheerio boxes from the '80s, yeah?&quot; They are &quot;becoming more and more popular again. They say they're great for guys that want the mileage of a Prius but without all that annoying attention from women who think you're an environmentalist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I love this. They say what's driving up the price of oil is the belief in the futures market that there will be a shortage in five years. Okay, so raise the price in five years!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama now focusing on John McCain.&quot; Obama is calling the presidential race &quot;'a contest of the past versus the future.' How many people wish it were the future and this election was already in the past? Are you sick of this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the McCain campaign announced it will be releasing John McCain's medical records. They would have released them sooner, but it took a while to dig them up, literally. They had to have a team of archeologists...dig them up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton had a campaign rally in Boca Raton, Florida, yesterday, after which, 30% of the people said they liked Hillary's speech. The other 70% said it was good to see Florence Henderson again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. MSNBC interviewed a certified astrologer on the news yesterday, to read the three candidates' birth charts and predict who would win. Well, at least, they used a certified astrologer, you know. You&quot; hate to see a respected news agency just go with a wacky astrologer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to his tax returns, President Bush is not as wealthy now as he was when first became president. Wow! ... How much did that wedding cost last week?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Jenna was recently married. I understand, as his wedding gift to the couple, President Bush gave them two $600 stimulus checks.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an article in the 'Wall Street Journal' this week about Olympic athletes who come in second, eventually getting a gold medal, like, years after a doping scandal -- like the woman who lost to Marion Jones.&quot; She &quot;was awarded the gold medal after Jones' steroid scandal, seven years after the fact. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big political news this weekend.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other news this week. Barack Obama was endorsed by 90-year-old Senator Robert Byrd. ... Yeah. Byrd said, 'Obama will make a great president and if he doesn't, I won't be around anyway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Arizona, police discovered that a church had a portable meth lab on its grounds. ... Yeah, police realized the church had a meth lab when the priest managed to say the entire mass in 20 seconds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that by staying home and watching this show tonight you are saving an average of $85 worth of gas? So you're welcome, America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news for John McCain. He announced this week he had his best fundraising month ever -- $18.5 million. That, plus what he gets from Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess McCain is scheduled to meet with three possible vice presidential nominees this weekend at his home. The candidates are very excited to go. They say the only downside -- they hate it when he keeps pushing that bowl of ribbon candy on them. 'Try the butterscotch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only other uncomfortable thing about McCain's household is plastic on the furniture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, on the news, they stress that these vice presidential meetings were only preliminary. And before any final decision is made, they say that McCain will sit down with his senior advisers. His senior advisers? The guy is 71. What, are they from the Millard Fillmore Administration?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And McCain released 1,200 pages of medical documents this week, to prove that he is healthy. ... Man. How many does Dick Cheney have?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when speaking in Montana, Barack Obama got a standing ovation when he said, 'It is time to take back the country.' The bad news -- he was on an Indian reservation at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, Vice President Dick Cheney gave the commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy. He was given a 19-gun salute. And two Coast Guard members were slightly injured when Cheney returned fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the financial forms, President Bush has actually lost money while he's been in the White House. But he says he will get it all back and much more, once the Nigerian businessman he's dealing with on the Internet transfers the money into his account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the radio coming in, I heard today, $4.50 gasoline is just around the corner. ... Here's the bad part -- that was the bargain tip line, okay? It's $4.50 around the corner. That was the tip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Missouri, a car dealer...is offering new car buyers their choice of $250 in free gas, or a free semi-automatic handgun. Eighty percent of people choose the handgun. Well, sure. You've got the gun; you can get the free gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Memorial Day weekend&quot; is &quot;also the opening of the barbecue season. You folks like to barbecue? I mean, let's face it, the polar ice caps just aren't melting fast enough, so let's get out there and&quot; barbecue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the big Indiana Jones movie opens up this weekend,&quot; and the &quot;star of the film...is a little older now. And he's really not much of a treasure hunter any more. In the big scene...in the movie, he goes out to his mailbox to look for his stimulus check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine says that former President Bill Clinton is pushing very hard for Barack Obama to choose Hillary as his vice president. ... Yeah, Bill says...Hillary would be a great vice president or a great ambassador to any country that's far, far away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, John McCain released 1,200 pages of his medical records. ... Or, as his doctor calls it, 'Chapter One.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's doctor says that McCain's service in the Vietnam war is unlikely to have any affect on his health. ... However, the doctor says that McCain's health might be affected by his service in the Civil War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Barack Obama was speaking to a Jewish group and he told them that his name Barack is the same as the Jewish word 'Baruch,' which means 'one who's blessed.' ... Obama had a harder time explaining his middle name, 'Hussein.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, it's Memorial Day weekend,&quot; which &quot;means it's time for the Indianapolis 500. ... Yeah. Unfortunately, because of the high gas prices, none of the cars will be going over 40 miles per hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of New Jersey is considering legalizing the use of medical marijuana. ... Yeah, residents say, 'Come on, we live in New Jersey. You've got to give us something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain made public his medical records. It was a huge document,&quot; with more &quot;than 84 pages on his ear hair alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is &quot;in great shape. Doctors say he could potentially live all the way through 2010.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, a man named Usain Bolt of Jamaica set a new world record in the 100 meter dash -- 9.72 seconds. ... That broke the old world record of 9.73 seconds set by superdelegates running away from Hillary Clinton.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like...the Democrats finally solved their delegate problem.&quot; It &quot;seems the Democratic Party rules panel agreed to allow delegates from Florida and Michigan to take part in the convention, but each delegate will only count as half a vote. ... You've heard of superdelegates? These are the new fun-sized delegates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Hillary Clinton, who won the Democratic primary in Puerto Rico. This is important because,&quot; as &quot;you know, Puerto Rico has absolutely no vote for president. Hello?! Yeah, great. I think she also won big in Guatemala.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Barack Obama left his church. And after, he said to Hillary, 'Okay, now it's your turn to quit something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Barack Obama says he's now looking for a new church, preferably one where the religious order has to take a vow of silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain, as you know,&quot; has &quot;released all his medical records. All indications are McCain is in very good health. But of course, they're still waiting for that report from the coroner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say McCain does take some medication,&quot; including &quot;Ambien to help him sleep. ... But they said he could eliminate the sleeping pills if he picks Mitt Romney as vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, McCain's doctor said Senator McCain is decades younger than his age. ... But then, so is President Bush,&quot; who &quot;is, what, in his early 60s? But he has the mind of a 12-year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Saudi OPEC chief said today the Saudis are very unhappy with the current spike in oil prices. I believe that's what's known in the oil business as lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Royal Navy has sent Prince William to patrol the Bahamas for the next two months. The Bahamas. Ooh. Well, thank God. You never know when those pesky pirates of the Caribbean might return again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actress Tatum O'Neal busted in New York City after being observed buying crack cocaine on the street. ... She told police she was just doing research for a film role. I believe the film role she was researching was 'The Tatum O'Neal Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to brag about stuff, but here in New York City,&quot; it is &quot;78 and sunny, just like Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's talk about the presidential Democratic primary.&quot; Over &quot;the weekend, I guess you know this, Hillary Clinton won the Puerto Rican primary,&quot; so she is now &quot;president of Puerto Rico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the...real test coming up next week&quot; is the &quot;Mexican primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And get ready because the election is only three years away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary now says that she is winning the popular vote. ... And Al Gore said, 'Yeah, well, a lot of good that does.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new book, President Bush's former press secretary said that Bush has 'a lack of inquisitiveness.' Yeah. When he heard this, Bush said, 'I don't know what he's saying, and I don't care.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Bush, yesterday -- this is true -- during a speech, President Bush said that his economic stimulus package is working, because when people use extra money to buy a machine, that creates jobs at 'the machine making place.' ... Yeah. Then Bush introduced his new speech writer, a 6-year-old boy named Timmy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news -- the whole voting process ended tonight. ... The bad news -- the 2012 Democratic primary starts on Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Barack Obama has won the nomination. Congratulations. And Hillary Clinton about to drop out. She's not dropped out officially. That means Bill Clinton's about to hear those three words he's been dreading ? 'Honey, I'm home!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I think&quot; Bill Clinton is &quot;starting to lose it. Today, he responded to a 'Vanity Fair' article suggesting he'd become angrier by calling the reporter a 'sleazy,' 'slimy,' 'dishonest' 'scumbag.' ... Well, that should nip those anger accusations in the bud, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife, Cindy McCain, has been taking high-speed driving lessons...in Phoenix. ... Well, that's important&quot; because when &quot;you're married to a guy as old as McCain, you have to know how to drive an ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former White House press spokesman Scott McClellan has written a book highly critical of the Bush Administration. And while in Utah, President Bush told an audience he has not read McClellan's book. He doesn't plan to read it. It's nothing to do with McClellan, just general principle. It's a book. It's got big words and not a lot of pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney has apologized to the people of West Virginia for making a joke about inbreeding at their expense. But see, I don't think Cheney gets it. In fact, today, while trying to apologize, he said he 'felt as stupid as a guy from Kentucky.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Universal Studios has reopened after&quot; a &quot;huge fire. ... And...they're making money off it right away&quot; by starting up a new ride called &quot;'Al Gore's Global Warming Adventure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about that tribe they found in Brazil? It seems they have never been contacted by the outside world. Although they live in brazil, they had no participation or representation in the political process there. They're kind of like delegates from Michigan and Florida here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they said these people are living the same way they did 1,000 years ago, to which Iran said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tribe has never had contact with the outside world. Never read a newspaper. Never listened to the news or watched the news. You've heard of bushmen? Well, these are like George Bushmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, HBO premiered a movie called 'Recount.' It's pretty good. It was about the 2000 presidential voting controversy in Florida. Or as Al Gore called it, 'Groundhog Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At Hillary Clinton Campaign Headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Wow, I can't believe the campaign's over already.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Hillary's changing onto her concession pantsuit.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'This is more depressing than a Mets game.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'So they're nominating the guy with most delegates, superdelegates, and states won? Outrageous!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Did you hear? The marquee melted on Letterman.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Help us, Iron Man!!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'The Senator is in intense negotiations with Jim Beam.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'There's a guy here to repossess the watercooler.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'It's not the end...You can always get fat and make a global warming documentary.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Is Obama still hiring?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Vice President, our old friend Dick Cheney,&quot; apologized for a joke &quot;he made about West Virginia. Nothing yet on the Iraqi war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, yeah, Hillary may be dropping out of the campaign and the campaign is broke. Don't kid yourselves. They've spent a lot of money there.&quot; In fact, the campaign is so broke that &quot;today, Hillary was wearing a certified, pre-owned pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. Campaign is so broke that a collection agency repoed all her pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is desperate to raise money. Today, she entered a wet pantsuit contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is nothing if not an optimist. She sees that the pantsuit is half full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when Hillary was campaigning in Puerto Rico, she was wearing a skimpy, two-piece pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hillary was campaigning in Wisconsin, she was wearing a cheese pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hillary was campaigning in Texas, she was wearing a pantsuit with chaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hillary was campaigning in Florida, it was so hot, she was wearing her pantsuit without the pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Associated Press reported today that Barack Obama has won enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. ... As a result, Hillary Clinton will concede sometime in the next 30 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new article in 'Vanity Fair' magazine hints...that former President Bill Clinton may have had an affair with actress Gina Gershon.&quot; The &quot;article also hints that John McCain may have had an affair with Estelle Getty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is &quot;campaigning, out traveling around the country, looking for donors, mostly organ donors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like we have a Democratic nominee for president,&quot; Barack Obama. And now, &quot;Hillary Clinton is indicating privately to friends, who then blab it to the cable news channels, that she would be open to the vice presidency.&quot; That &quot;would mean the chain of command would be Hillary as vice president, Obama as president, and then Oprah on top of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ninety-year-old Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the longest serving senator in American history, was hospitalized yesterday for a mild infection that they say was causing lethargy and sluggishness.&quot; They &quot;pinpointed the problem and it turns out he's been dead for more than 22 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this is it. Final clearance. All Hillary Clinton jokes must go tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Barack Obama, who secured enough delegates last night to get the nomination.&quot; But Hillary Clinton is &quot;still not conceding her campaign because she says there's still a chance of the vice presidency. In fact, she's going to offer it to Barack one last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that's...the big question on everybody's mind. What does Hillary want? Of course, the bigger question is, who's going to tell her she can't get it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to sources in Hillary's camp, Hillary Clinton says she's open to being Barack Obama's running mate. Here's my question. How can she ask him for a job when she won't even admit he's the guy that's going to be doing the hiring?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during her speech last night, you know, Hillary kept referring to Barack as 'my friend,'&quot; but she used &quot;the same tone&quot; she does when she calls &quot;Bill 'my husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama reportedly tried to call Hillary Clinton twice last night and got her voice mail both times. ... Doesn't that sound like a bad breakup? 'I tried to call her. She wouldn't pick up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Hillary only answers the phone at 3:00 a.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Barack Obama also tried to call John McCain, but McCain had the TV up so loud, he couldn't hear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that Barack Obama's going to be the nominee, it shows you how far we've come in this country. Think about this. When a black man named Barack Obama has just as good a chance to blow a sure thing election for the Democrats as white guys like John Kerry and Al Gore -- that is progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton is lashing out at the writer of a 'Vanity Fair' article that came out this week. Did you hear about this? You know the one that accuses him of numerous affairs? Where do they get this crazy stuff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and in a speech...last night, John McCain said we must get off of fossil fuel. See, that's why a lot of people admire McCain. That's why he's considered such a maverick. Here you have a fossil coming out against fossil fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, has proposed new laws which human rights groups say would force citizens in that country to inform on one another. The good news -- finally some common ground with President Bush. Maybe they can start talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Israel now wants to use a new weapon against its own settlers who don't want to evacuate the Gaza Strip. It's a device that emits sounds that make the listener nauseous and want the leave the area. And don't be shocked. We've used that in America for years. It's called karaoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they say with the rising cost of fuel, the airlines might have to start treating passengers more like freight,&quot; as &quot;opposed to Northwest, which treats them like cattle. Totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new survey by the Department of Energy and General Motors, 90% of women surveyed said they would rather be with a guy who drives a fuel efficient car than a guy who drives a big, fancy sports car. The other 10% of the women live here in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, that robot that landed on Mars the other day, now looking for water on the Martian surface. ... You see how expensive a bottle of water from Fiji is? How much is Martian water going to cost?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for the Smart Car,&quot; those &quot;cute little...cars you see running around.&quot; The &quot;National Highway Safety Administration conducted a crash test last week,&quot; and the &quot;Smart Car did very well.&quot; The drivers, however, &quot;didn't make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to New York City,&quot; where it is &quot;71 and hazy. You know, kind of like John McCain.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, it is &quot;67 and gloomy, like Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're not going to believe this, but a bunch of people in Italy&quot; are turning Al Gore's documentary, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth,&quot; into &quot;an opera. ... A lecture on global warming. I mean, cut &quot;me a slice of that. Let's go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to some of the great songs in the Al Gore 'Inconvenient Truth' opera. 'You Make Me Feel So Hot,' that's one. 'Come Fry With Me.' 'Call Me Biodegradable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic primary is over. Who wants to tell Hillary?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yep. Hillary lost, and she said today, 'I'm not going anywhere. I've already purchased my inaugural pantsuit.' So she's here to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Barack Obama is the Democratic nominee, Americans are going to have to choose between the 46-year-old Obama and the 71-year-old John McCain. ... In other words, there's a choice between the Hillary-defeater or the Wal-Mart greeter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see people wondering...about John McCain's possible running mate. Experts say he wants someone who's not afraid to attack Barack Obama,&quot; which &quot;explains why McCain has decided to pick Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, a high school student, who is an illegal immigrant, is about to be deported. But since he's the school's valedictorian, he's asking President Bush to help. Yeah. Yeah, Bush told the valedictorian, 'Don't worry. I'll never let them send you back to Valedictoria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan has written a tell-all book, full of inside information about how the public was misled prior to the invasion of Iraq. Yeah. The title of the book: 'Stuff That Would've Been Really, Really Helpful Five Years Ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the real story today is the race for the White House,&quot; and &quot;we finally know our candidates -- the senators from Illinois and Arizona, Barack Obama and John McCain. A young, idealistic guy vs. an old, experienced guy. Like David vs. David on 'American Idol.' Except more people vote for 'Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the big news today is that Democrats seem to be in agreement that Barack is the obaminee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the news? It says Hillary Clinton will concede the race on Friday, which should make for a fun weekend for Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, everyone's wondering now if Obama will ask Hillary to be his running mate. Obama actually tried to call her last night and got her voicemail twice. I guess she only takes calls at 3:00 a.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was also probably hard to hear the phone over the sound of her husband weeping.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy weather around the country. There were tornado warnings in Washington, DC. yesterday. In fact, the winds were so strong it was the first time a president in the Oval Office got under his own desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Hillary Clinton's camp said she is not actively seeking the vice presidential nomination. And then her pantsuit caught on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political analysts say that Barack Obama's immediate concern should be to mend the relations with Hillary's millions of women supporters who are upset that, of course, she is not the nominee.&quot; So &quot;today, he offered them healthcare and free tickets to 'Sex and the City.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I think it's finally starting to sink in to Hillary that she didn't get it. Like, today she went down to IKEA, because I think she realizes this is the only chance she was going to have to put together her own cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the US National Intelligence Director, only 30% of Afghanistan and its borders are under control by the government,&quot; which &quot;sounds bad until you realize only 20% of California borders are under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news -- a sociologist and military expert who created the policy of 'don't ask, don't tell' for the armed forces has passed away. He's survived by -- well, we're not allowed to tell you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Times,' a new study says that red wine may slow down the aging process. In a related story, John McCain now drinking 28 glasses of red wine a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'USA Today' reports it looks more and more likely actors are going to go on strike June 30th. ... So hey, that happens, the only place you're going to get to see actors -- rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions On The Barack Obama Running Mate Application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. How much experience do you have doing nothing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Do you have any crazy clergymen we should know about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Will you help your oil company buddies achieve record profits by screwing consumers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. How many friends do you have on Facebook?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Can your charisma and vitality match the high standards set by Dick Cheney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Why the hell was Billy Crystal on Letterman talking about 'Soap: The Complete Series,' now available on DVD?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Do you think the Yankees should move Joba back to the bullpen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Any idea what happened on the season finale of 'Lost'? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Have you ever slept with Barbara Walters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By any chance, do you know where Osama bin Laden is?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential candidates &quot;are taking the weekend off. John McCain will be resting at his ranch, the Rio Magnesia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will &quot;be resting at his ranch, the Rancho Mylanta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will &quot;be on his ranch, the Double A RP.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain will be relaxing at his ranch, the Lazy Colon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton...has announced that she&quot; will be &quot;officially ending her campaign on Saturday. ... She's going to wait until Saturday because tomorrow is the Honduras primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm beginning to wonder if maybe Hillary doesn't get it,&quot; because she is &quot;now saying that she still has a shot at the Republican nomination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know,&quot; in &quot;the larger sense,&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;ending her campaign&quot; is &quot;really kind of sad,&quot; because it means &quot;the Clinton dream of being a two impeachment family&quot; goes &quot;right down the drain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama clinched the Democratic presidential nomination this week. And it's been reported that Hillary Clinton is going to concede on Saturday. That's right, yeah. Yeah, that's Saturday, December 15th, 2017.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in San Diego say that a surfer turned in 70 pounds of marijuana that he found on the beach. ... Yeah, when asked why he turned in 70 pounds of marijuana, the surfer said, 'Because I found 200 pounds of marijuana.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a big question people are asking Hillary Clinton -- what is she going to do next? Where will she go? Where will she end up? Is she going to retire? No, I'm sorry, that's what they keep asking me. I'm sorry, I forgot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the talk is that Hillary Clinton is going to try and help unite the party. ... But today Bill Clinton says, according to his experience, the party is usually over whenever Hillary shows up. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had a secret meeting last night at Senator Dianne Feinstein's house. Feinstein said they sat in two comfortable chairs facing one another. And, she also had a reclining Barcalounger and a blanket in case McCain showed up. So that was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has challenged Barack Obama to join him in ten town hall debates. Already they're having disagreements. I guess Barack wants the first debate to be in Las Vegas. And McCain's pushing for Branson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' a lot of Republicans are very excited about the idea of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for McCain's running mate.&quot; Jindal is &quot;a child of immigrants from India. His parents came from India, and he can bring youth to the ticket. And of course, McCain's excited because he wants to learn how to use e-mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger officially declared there is a drought here in California. I think that's what he said. Or he might have said, 'I think I have gout.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fire officials in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, say a couple burned down their apartment after they brought 45 gallons of gasoline at $3.50 a gallon and kept it in their closet to use later when gas hit $5 a gallon. Here's my question. Should people this stupid even be allowed to drive, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the price of gasoline and fuel, cutbacks hitting the airlines very hard; United Airlines laying off employees. Today, Continental announced they're cutting 3,000 jobs, retiring some of the older jets. In fact, last weekend when I was at the airport, I saw airline pilots hitting passengers up for beer money. It was really sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not the only ones. Today, Southwest announced on some flights they're eliminating the plane. Passengers will be traveling by cannon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a nice story. Actor George Takei -- played Mr. Sulu on the original 'Star Trek.' You all know Mr. Sulu?&quot; He &quot;has announced plans to marry his long-time male companion now that gay marriage is legal here in California. But here's the interesting part. Did you know he wasn't even gay until that transporter room malfunctioned in episode 17?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Gore, for &quot;a while was vice president,&quot; and &quot;he had the book and the film, 'Inconvenient Truth,'&quot; which was &quot;about climate change.&quot; Well, &quot;they're turning that 'Inconvenient Truth' into an opera. Al Gore and opera, are you kidding? Cut me a slice of that! Let's go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...they had some trouble and they have postponed the opening of that opera. Apparently, the composer is having trouble finding a rhyme for low emission hybrid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An article in 'USA Today' reports that Barack Obama and John McCain have two very different visions of the world. That's what it said. Yeah. Biggest difference is that John McCain's vision makes it impossible for him to drive at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A high school in Ohio passed out over 300 diplomas last week. And on the diploma, the word education was spelled wrong. Yeah. Officials say the misprint should not harm the reputation of George W. Bush High School.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama&quot; and &quot;Hillary Clinton had what they called a secret meeting last night in Washington, DC. ... One of the topics they are rumored to have discussed is Hillary's $20 million campaign debt. Obama may help her cover some of that, but she's still going to be on the hook for most of it. And today, she outlined a broad-based plan for recouping that money. Her plan is to marry and then divorce Paul McCartney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Music legend Bob Dylan, who's...maybe the most respected person in all of music, told the Times of London today that he supports Barack Obama. Or at least they think that's what he said. He may have been trying to book a flight to Omaha. So we may never know for sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Then the Secret Service grabbed her, threw her to the ground, and said, 'What have you done with the real Senator Clinton?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama took time off this weekend from campaigning to spend time with his family. In fact, he said on Saturday night, he was going on a date with his wife. ... When Bill Clinton heard that, he said, 'Hillary, we need to stay away from these people. They're freaks!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's campaign camp, or Hillary Clinton's camp, I guess, has said today she is not actively seeking the vice presidential nomination'&quot; even &quot;'though she's the most qualified and would be ready on day one!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Edwards says he has ruled out running for vice president. Not because he doesn't consider it an honor. He just doesn't want to move into a smaller house, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain has a new slogan. Have you heard his new slogan? 'A leader we can believe in.' See, that's a lot better than his old slogan: 'I'll be okay. Give me a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee,&quot; is &quot;being called a hero&quot; after &quot;he saved a man's life over the weekend by performing the Heimlich maneuver. ... In fact,&quot; the Los Angeles Lakers, who are currently losing in the NBA Finals, &quot;have a call in to him right now. They're trying to get him on staff!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what's going on in the NBA playoffs? The Celtics are now leading two games to zero. ... I don't want to say the Lakers are losing confidence, but I understand Kobe's already hinting he might be willing to settle for vice champion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new survey, most Americans say the country is going in the wrong direction. Hey, with the price of gas, most Americans can't afford to go in any direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, for the first time in history, the national average for gallon of gas is over $4 a gallon. In fact, today Dick Cheney was seen putting up his own 'mission accomplished' sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four dollars a gallon. That's unbelievable, isn't it? You know, I heard a lot of people complaining about that today as they were drinking their $6 lattes at Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm not saying the guy that owns my local gas station is getting rich, but you know that glass barrier they have between and you the cash register? His is made of Waterford Crystal. It's beautiful!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, California has the highest gas prices in the country. I think premium is like $4.88. It's almost $5 a gallon. In fact, gas is so expensive, today I saw a van packed with legal Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And ten US airports...are now using,&quot; and &quot;many more&quot; are &quot;going to be getting those total body scanners&quot; that &quot;can actually see what's under a person's clothes and in their pockets. Yeah, this is the way the airlines can be 100% sure you're not walking away with any cash left after you buy your ticket and pay extra money for your luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company called Bloomsbury Chocolates is now making something called candy with a conscience. Yes, yes. Some of the money from each chocolate bar goes to offset your carbon footprint. You know, maybe if didn't eat so much chocolate, you wouldn't have such a big...carbon footprint. Maybe that's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on June 13th, a Las Vegas nightclub will present Kevin Federline with the father of the year award. ... Also being honored that evening,&quot; Tatum O'Neill &quot;for getting drugs off the streets one rock at a time.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. That was about as sincere as an endorsement from Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how hot it is today in New York City. ... It's so hot, over the weekend, Barack Obama enjoyed the chilly meeting with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is so &quot;hot that Hillary Clinton conceded she was sweating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's 105 and miserable. You know, like John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama took a break from the campaign&quot; yesterday &quot;to take his family on a bike ride. ... Meanwhile, John McCain took his family for a ride on his Rascal scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor...that if Barack Obama is elected president, he might appoint Bill Clinton to the Supreme Court. ... Yeah, which is good because the one woman Hillary doesn't mind Bill hanging out with is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is over $4,&quot; which explains the new nickname for gasoline -- Starbucks for your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'll tell you, thing are not good. The price of oil doubled in less than a year. Home foreclosures are at a record high. Unemployment is surging. But yesterday...we saw a ray of hope. President Bush left the country. So maybe things will get better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the most recent survey, 14% of the people believe that we will see $5 a gallon gas by the end of the year. ... The other 86% think we'll see it by the end of the week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. Saudi Arabia announced they will call a meeting of all the OPEC nations.&quot; And they &quot;promised to crack down on the high gas prices. Well, let's hope it's as successful as the Saudi crackdown on terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today it was made public that Hillary Clinton spent $212 million on her campaign for the nomination. ... The last time anybody spent that kind of money to come in second was the New York Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know something? I think Hillary may secretly be glad that this whole thing is over, because now she can go back to doing what she loves most -- hunting, drinking whiskey, shooting. You know, get back to her roots, as we saw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news is Hillary is on Barack Obama's list for potential vice presidents. ... The bad news: she's just a little bit below the Reverend Wright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I thought Hillary was very gracious&quot; in her concession speech. She gave Barack Obama &quot;her full support. And today, she sent him a basket of fresh tomatoes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Barack Obama took the weekend off from campaigning. He said on Saturday night he went on a date with his wife, Michelle. ... The nice thing is they can stay out late on Saturday nights without having to worry about getting up to go to church anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Barack Obama spoke with John McCain on the phone. I don't want to say McCain is getting old, but halfway through the conversation, McCain said to Barack, 'Can you put your mommy on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his new blog -- you know, he's got a blog. McCain has a blog now. He announced he is a huge Abba fan. Abba! Well, that will bring in the young voters, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain has a new slogan: 'A leader we can believe in.&quot; That's a good slogan. Don't confuse that with President Bush's slogan: 'We can't believe he's our leader.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of US airports are getting these full body scanners, you know, where they can actually see through your clothes. And a lot of people are uncomfortable with this. And they say anyone who is uncomfortable can choose to get patted down instead. Well, that's a nice choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in 'Esquire' magazine this month, they have an interview with Snoop Dogg,&quot; who is &quot;quoted as saying, 'A lot of people try to make you think you're not smart if you never went to college.' He says, 'It's common sense that rules everything.' Snoop Dogg says he learned common sense from selling crack. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't common sense keep you from selling crack? I mean, the only thing you ever learn selling drugs is maybe the metric system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said his differences with Hillary Clinton are 'infinitesimal, tiny, minute, trivial and inconsequential.' ... When he heard this, President Bush said, 'That guy knows way too many words to be president.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN reports that John McCain is aggressively trying to win over the independent vote. Yeah, of course, to John McCain, independent means anyone who can make it to the toilet without help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokesman for United Arab Emirates Airlines says, this summer, it will launch non-stop flights from the United States to Dubai. Yeah, the spokesman said, 'We want to give Americans a chance to visit their money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Archaeologists in Jordan have discovered the world's oldest church. It's 2,000 years old. Some of the people who went to this church include King Herod, Moses, and John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, gas across the entire country averaging $4 a gallon. ... Or as we call that in Los Angeles, the good old days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And believe me, the oil companies, they are laughing all the way to the bank that's foreclosing on your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed, though, since gas is four bucks a gallon, there have been no big oil spills? Isn't it funny how that happens? Remember when gas was a buck fifty a gallon? Whole tankers were plowing into bridges. 'Hey, woo! We're ramming Alaska.'&quot; Now, &quot;it's five bucks. 'Hey, hey! Be careful!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you probably know, California has the highest gas prices in the country. We're almost $5 a gallon here. In fact, it's gotten so bad, today, the LA Subway system actually had a rider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush gave a big speech today in Europe. He says he regrets giving the false impression that he is not a man of peace. But see, that's the problem. Oh, you start one or two little wars, and right away, oh, everybody jumps to conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The Washington Post,' Barack Obama and actress Scarlett Johansson are e-mail buddies. ... So, you got a...23-year-old gorgeous, blonde actress e-mailing a married presidential candidate. Well, what could go wrong there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not to be outdone today, John McCain admitted he had been exchanging flirty e-mails with Angela Lansbury. And there's talk of Rue McClanahan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's camp says she is not actively a seeking the vice president nomination. Passive aggressively seeking it, yes, but not actively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Connecticut found a pipe bomb concealed inside a raw dead chicken lying by the side of the road. ... So it sounds like al Qaeda is starting to have serious budget problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A pipe bomb in a dead chicken. They think it's either the work of a terrorist organization or Carrot Top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this tomato thing with this salmonella scare? It's now spread to 17 states. It would have been 19 states, but as you know, they don't count Michigan and Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what NASA wants to do. They want to get to the sun,&quot; find &quot;the thermostat, and turn it down!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John McCain just announced he wants to do a series of town hall meetings where he'll meet with the public. That's a good idea, yeah. It's all part of McCain's 'Speak Up, I Can't Hear You' tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA has announced plans to send a probe to orbit the sun, where it will have to withstand temperatures of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. When he heard about it, President Bush said, 'Why don't they just go at night?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New study just came out. It says that most computer support workers would take a pay cut to work from home. Yeah. Their exact quote was, 'We miss living in India.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says the average American can expect to live six months longer than they would have at the time of the last study. ... Finally, some good news for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently Barack Obama is e-mail buddies with Scarlet Johansson. ... This is making me question Barack Obama's judgment, though. If he has Scarlet Johansson's e-mail address, why is he wasting time running for president?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he's gone, don't worry, America is safe and sound in the more competent hands of Barney, the White House terrier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's like a farewell tour for the President before he returns home to kick off his six-month good riddance tour here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there are now plans to bring back 'Mad Max.' Remember that movie where the people were killing each other over a few gallons of gas? Well, it's coming back. Not as a movie,&quot; though. This time, it will be &quot;a reality show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Saudi Arabia information and cultural minister announced this week that his nation will hold a meeting of OPEC members to discuss the skyrocketing cost of oil. Yeah. It's not really a meeting, it's more like a victory party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, thank God we live in America and not under the thumb of an all-powerful oil lobby, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the country of Abu Dhabi announced they're buying the Chrysler Building in New York. They're buying the Chrysler Building. Hey, why not? The Saudis already own the White House, why not buy the Chrysler Building too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do they have to buy such a famous New York City landmark, you know what I'm saying? I mean, why not buy something in New York that people don't really want, like the Knicks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, another defeat for President Bush today. It seems the Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantanamo Bay can file legal challenges to their detention. And President Bush&quot; is &quot;very bitter about this. He said...he may have lost, but it was a deeply divided court that voted 5-4. ... You know, the same vote that made him President -- 5-4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The New York Times' reporting that Clinton associates are keeping an enemies list...of all of the people who are considered Clinton traitors. And ironically, both Bill and Hillary are on each others' lists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard&quot; the &quot;story that Barack Obama and Scarlett Johansson are apparently e-mail buddies? Scarlett Johansson is quoted as saying, 'My heart belongs to Obama.' How about that, huh? Barack's not even president yet,&quot; and he is &quot;still doing way better than Bill Clinton ever did. Whoo! No Paula Jones there! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama surprised a bunch of students in Chicago yesterday when he showed up unannounced at an eighth grade graduation. Gave a speech at the eighth grade graduation&quot; which was &quot;pretty cool. Now, don't confuse that with President Bush's appearance last year at an eighth grade graduation. He was just there getting a diploma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is now in Europe. Again, you know, we like president Bush. I just don't think he has a real grasp of history. Did you see him in Berlin yesterday? He said, 'Am I crazy, or did there used to be a wall here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess President Bush is in Italy today,&quot; but he was a &quot;little disappointed&quot; by the experience. Yes, &quot;a little disappointed. For lunch, he said he spent the whole day driving around, trying to find an Olive Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a terrific new diet plan out, guaranteed to help you lose five pounds overnight. ... You eat three unwashed tomatoes, you can drop the weight just like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is traveling in Europe, and he spent the last couple of days in Italy.&quot; He &quot;went to Venice and he thought the streets were flooded. And he said, 'Don't worry, FEMA is on the way. Hang on. We'll be right there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't eat tomatoes&quot; because &quot;they're tainted with...deadly salmonella. Yeah, now listen to this. First, of course, we went through tainted lettuce. ... Now, tainted tomatoes.&quot; Who &quot;would have thought that the healthiest part of a BLT would be the bacon? Honestly, what is happening?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things &quot;couldn't get any worse for the Lakers, huh? Did you see that game last night?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was a big power outage in Washington, DC this morning, the whole city. The good news is Homeland Security says it was not terrorism. Whew! Luckily, it was just our lousy energy policy. So that's a relief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And OPEC said, this week, it will call a meeting of its members to discuss what it calls 'unjustified' oil prices. See, not to bring the price down. They just want to come up with a reason to justify it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia says he wants to have this meeting. Now, you ever notice when OPEC nations get together, there's always kings and sultans and crowned princes? See, that's where the term 'royally screwed' comes from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visited the Vatican this week and met with the Pope. ... Again, you see, I don't think President Bush really studies up on these places before he goes to them. Like, as soon as he saw where the Pope lived, he said, 'Hey, I like what the little lady has done with the place.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what today is? Friday the 13th. ... And down in Washington DC, a confused President Bush lit a menorah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday right here on CBS, the annual Tony Awards.&quot; Vice President Dick Cheney &quot;received a Tony nomination&quot; for &quot;his performance in 'The Angina Monologues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, thankfully&quot; the presidential &quot;candidates are taking the weekend off. And John McCain will be resting at his ranch, Rancho Sciatica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, that ranch is located right outside of Denture Springs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what happened today? Barack Obama put his birth certificate online to fight rumors he wasn't born in the US. ... John McCain will put his birth certificate online too, as soon as he figures out how to upload a stone tablet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush was in Italy over the weekend, where he met with the Pope. And once again, you know, we like President Bush,&quot; but &quot;I don't think he is that familiar with Catholicism. Like, he asked the Pope, 'So, the family taking you out for Father's Day?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; this &quot;past weekend,&quot; they &quot;had the World Naked Bike Ride to protest our dependence on oil. ... Let me tell you, this is one environmental rally&quot; where &quot;you don't want to get stuck behind Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York&quot; has &quot;introduced a bill that will grant...immigrant visas&quot; to &quot;supermodels that want to come here. Well, I have never been prouder to be an American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the nice thing about bringing these foreign supermodels here, you don't have to worry about them taking food out of American mouths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, today, gay marriage became legal here in the state of California. ... Of course, with gay marriage now being legal, this will give birth to the next big growth industry here in California -- gay divorce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is going after the Hillary Clinton female voters. Yes, and as a matter of fact, today, he was campaigning in a pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is actively courting women over 60. And I'm thinking, well who does this guy think he is, Ashton Kutcher?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; is &quot;thinking that he'll write his memoir. ... Unfortunately, the problem with the President writing his presidential memoir, I mean, I think before you write a book, you have to have read one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He tells people the problem is he has writer's block. ... Of course he does. It's that thing between his ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at the US Open, 32-year-old Tiger Woods came back to beat 45-year-old Rocco Mediate. ... And apparently, when he heard that a younger African-American beat an older white man, John McCain said, 'Uh-oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Father's Day,&quot; and &quot;John McCain said he made plans to spend it with his grandchildren. ... Unfortunately, McCain's grandchildren couldn't make it because they spent the day with their grandchildren.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressmen Ron Paul has finally decided to suspend his presidential campaign. ... Paul said, 'There comes a time when you realize that you have no chance to win, and that time was six months ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that...after he retires, he wants to write a book. ... Bush said he's not sure if it will be about politics or about his personal life, but he is sure it will be a pop-up book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Cuba, 34 Cubans were arrested for trying to leave the country onboard a yacht. ... Of course, in Cuba, a yacht is five inner tubes tied to a king-size mattress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's already having a ripple effect, this gay marriage thing. In fact, since it was instituted yesterday, marriage proposals to Liza Minnelli have dropped 65%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some say gay marriage will soon be an everyday event as common as, like, a Pamela Anderson marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you see, unlike Massachusetts, California has no residency requirement for marriage, so a lot of gays from out of state can come here and get married. In fact, if you're gay, and you can prove you're in the country illegally, they'll not only give you a gay marriage license, they'll give you a California driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced he will happily perform gay weddings. And believe me; if you know our mayor, you know how seriously he takes those wedding vows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in political news, Barack Obama was endorsed by Al Gore at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit yesterday. I tell you something, you could feel the excitement in the room. It was unbelievable. And then Al Gore walked in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Father's Day, Barack Obama gave a speech&quot; in which he &quot;said that fathers should be more responsible. And he also said that David Archuleta's dad was a little pushy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a New York congressman by the name of Anthony Weiner&quot; has &quot;introduced a bill to grant immigrant visas to supermodels that want to come here.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, remember Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy that came here and then was sent back home? ... Well, he's now 14 years old and has joined Cuban's Young Communist Union,&quot; which is &quot;the second most popular organization for Cubans to join,&quot; after &quot;the New York Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to try to calm down consumers, the Saudis announced again today there is no oil shortage. ... In fact, they guarantee they have more than enough oil to keep screwing us into well into the next century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's something. If you live in a small town, carnivals are closing down. Because of the high cost of fuel, the carnival owners can't afford to run the rides. The oil companies are closing down the carnivals. So, basically, you have the big-time con men putting the small-time con men out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let's face it, when it comes to scaring people, the carnivals can't compete with the oil companies, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has endorsed Barack Obama for president. ... Medical experts say this is great because it gives the Obama campaign a much needed shot of boredom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore. Think about it.&quot; If he endorses you, &quot;you're getting an endorsement from a guy who has received an Academy Award, received a Grammy,&quot; and the &quot;Nobel Prize.&quot; Oh, and &quot;Gore...also won a competitive eating contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, of course, going head to head, you have Barack Obama and John McCain. They're already putting together debates. Here's how it will be. Barack Obama says after each question, he wants a one-minute response. And John McCain says after each question, he wants a five- minute nap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's staff and John McCain's staff are busy now negotiating when the presidential debates will take place. ... Yeah, Obama wants them to be in September, and McCain wants them to be after his nap, but before 'Wheel of Fortune.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Barack Obama, yesterday, Barack Obama said, if he becomes president, he will replace the White House bowling alleys because it's something he would never use. ... Yeah, apparently, this is the same reason President Bush got rid of the White House Library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton will be attending the same conference in Florida. ... Yeah, the conference is sponsored by the National Association of Men Who Have Been Attacked by Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Al Gore endorsed Barack Obama. And a number of women fainted during Barack's speech,&quot; but not &quot;from the speech. It's just Al Gore turned the air conditioning down. You know, global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new poll shows that less than one out of four Americans now think President Bush is doing a good job. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush says he plans to publish a book once he leaves the White House. We have an advanced copy here. This won't be out till January. It's 'Iraq On $100 Million A Day.' It's a travel book.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama announced today he will not accept $85 million in public financing for his presidential campaign.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a bunch of these Bear Stearns hedge funds guys were arrested for shady business practices. Talk about turning lemons into lemonade, today Bear Stearns...announced they're opening a new division specializing in bail bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government says they're focusing on some e-mails that show these guys may have given bad investment advice. For example, a lot of the e-mails began, 'I'm a diplomat currently living in exile in Nigeria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Senator John McCain were both touring the flood-damaged areas of Iowa this week, but they did not cross each other's path.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. According to a Pentagon report this week, more than 1,000 nuclear missile components in the US arsenal are lost and cannot be located. Huh? We can't even find our own weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In their defense,&quot; the &quot;Air Force said today there is a big difference between something being missing and just not being able to find it, which would be okay if you're talking about a pair of lost sunglasses!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US officials announced today that Israel has carried out what they are calling 'a well choreographed rehearsal' of an attack on Iran. .... What's that like? 'Five, six, seven, eight ? we're going to bomb you, we're going to get you!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed how a lot of gas stations now have TV screens where they show the news or clips of the news? You know, let me tell you something, okay? If I'm paying $5 a gallon, I want HBO, Showtime and pay-per-view, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With gas costing half as much in Mexico,&quot; a &quot;lot of American are flocking to Tijuana to fill up their tanks. And listen to this. If you bring back 15 or 20 illegal aliens, you can use the carpool lane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Ralph Nader attacked Barack Obama for refusing to accept public financing for his campaign and said that Obama was too closely tied to big business. ... Yeah, then the guy sitting next to Nader on the park bench said, 'Shut up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has ordered...his troops now to find Osama bin Laden. Yep. Boy, he really jumped on that one, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush held a celebration at the White House honoring jazz. ... Yeah. It was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'This is great. It's just like being in an elevator.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Californians now driving across the border to get cheap gas in Mexico. Here's another tip. Instead of gas, try using Rite Aid vodka. Much cheaper, and about the same mileage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this, ladies and gentlemen? Hillary Clinton is out campaigning with Barack Obama. ... She says if it goes well, she'll consider making him her running mate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain and Barack Obama have both laid out their energy plans. Obama wants enough 'green' energy to power the entire US economy, and McCain just wants enough energy to stay up past nine o'clock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there was an interesting study released today which says that people who live here in the state of California...are less convinced that there is a god than the people of any other state in the country.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been very difficult for the firefighters to get things under control because the vegetation up in Northern California where the fires are is about 40% marijuana plants.&quot; So &quot;the poor crews, they're supposed to be bringing in supplies,&quot; but they &quot;keep bringing in Doritos and chocolate milk shakes. And it's not helping.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, big scare today for Barack Obama. His airplane had to make an unscheduled landing because of mechanical problems. While the pilot was steering to the left, the plane was apparently drifting to the right.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's wife, Michelle, pretty distraught when she first heard the news that his plane had problems. Although, not nearly as distraught as Hillary Clinton when she heard everything was okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton met last week in Unity, New Hampshire, to campaign together and to show their unity. ... That shows you what a great country this is. Only in America can a woman who married a man from Hope go to a town called Unity and fake something called sincerity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama is now denying that he is e-mail pals with the beautiful actress, Scarlett Johansson. ... In fact, his exact words were, 'I did not have textual relations with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a comment many people are calling racist. This is a stupid thing to say. It seems the Republican Party operative, a man named Grover Norquist, told the 'LA Times' that Barack Obama was just 'John Kerry with a tan.' ... Well, using that logic, if Barack Obama is John Kerry with a tan, then John McCain is George Bush with an enlarged prostate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, speaking of John McCain, I thought this was nice.&quot; He &quot;went to North Carolina last week to visit 89-year-old Evangelical legend, the Reverend Billy Graham. And he was frail and confused and couldn't visit for long. But Billy Graham looked great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, trying to get up to speed on this energy crisis, and not a moment too soon. This guy is on top of everything. But Bush said, now, he's not just for offshore drilling,&quot; he also &quot;says he's looking for other alternatives. Like, today, he supports drilling for solar energy. See, I don't think he quite understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the French military injured 16 people in a training exercise, when they used real bullets instead of blanks. Of course, people were stunned. The French have real bullets? What?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the fourth of July -- did you hear this? President Bush gave a speech at the home of former President Thomas Jefferson. ... Yeah, there was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'I would like to salute both Thomas Jefferson and his wife, Weezie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic convention is being held at a 20,000-seat arena in Denver,&quot; but Barack Obama &quot;has decided to give his acceptance speech at Denver's 80,000-seat football stadium. ... Meanwhile, Ralph Nader will be giving his acceptance speech at a Foot Locker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has announced that they are shutting down several of their largest factories for the rest of the summer, so there will be less pollution for the Olympics. Yeah. Chinese officials say, 'Sorry, but for the next couple of months, you're going to have to buy your lead-coated toys somewhere else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course a nasty heat wave gripping most of the nation. In fact, it was so hot today John McCain offered a $300 million prize to the first person who can develop a prune Slurpee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the other big celebrity divorce...going on in New York&quot; involves former supermodel Christie Brinkley. And that divorce trial is &quot;getting sleazy,&quot; with talk of web cams and the Internet. In fact, &quot;they're calling&quot; the Rodriguez and Brinkley divorces &quot;the most embarrassing things to happen in New York since the governor and the last governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy birthday to President Bush,&quot; who turned &quot;62 on Sunday.&quot; So, Bush &quot;is now twice his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush is now in Japan for the big G8 summit, which is going on right now. The G8 summit is where the world's top economies get together. The bad news -- we are no longer one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say the US economy is doing&quot; badly, but do &quot;you know how Bush got to Japan? Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry is now criticizing John McCain. Kerry says McCain does not have the judgment to be president. I don't think that's true. I mean, McCain had the good judgment not to accept Kerry's offer to be his running mate in 2004.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democrats are now preparing for their convention in Denver, and they have hired the first-ever 'Director of Greening.' They say this will ensure that everything about their convention will be green, including nominating a candidate who has only been a senator for a couple years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among the catering guidelines for the green convention, this is true, there will be no fried foods at the Democratic convention.&quot; So &quot;today, Al Gore announced he's switching his support to John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some interesting political trivia for you. The last time that the Democrats had their convention in Denver is when they dominated William Jennings Bryan in 1908. And, coincidentally, you know who the Republican nominee was that year? John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, to get ready for the Olympics and improve the awful air quality in Beijing, China, a large number of the factories around the city have closed. ... In a related story, today Wal-Mart announced they are out of everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy birthday to the Dalai Lama,&quot; who &quot;had a birthday this week. ... That's got to be tough to shop for, huh, trying to find a gift that wasn't made in China?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course the big story here in Los Angeles, will the actors go on strike? ... See, people don't realize&quot; that while the strike could affect the TV and movie business, it &quot;could decimate the whole LA rehab industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's staff recently announced that Barack is planning to hold a campaign event at a NASCAR race. ... Yeah, the event will be called 'Meet Your First Black Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Denver, a 60-year-old woman was kicked out of a John McCain rally for heckling him. Afterwards, McCain said, 'I'm just not popular with young women.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush met with the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Afterwards, Bush regarded him as, quote, 'a smart guy.' Yeah. Yeah, when asked how he knows he's smart, Bush said, 'He speaks fluent Russian.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Cuba announced they will send a rowing team to the Olympics. ... Yeah, apparently, the...team started training last month and hasn't been seen since.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know there are still 330 active wildfires in California? And thousands of homes are threatened, although not nearly as many homes&quot; as &quot;are threatened by Countrywide Mortgage.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hurricane Bertha is gaining strength. But the good news, listen to this -- since NBC bought The Weather Channel, there's a good chance the storm will be cancelled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you think it's hot now? 'Discover' magazine says in 3 billion years, the sun's intensity will be so strong it will boil the oceans and turn the entire Earth into a deserted desert. Like Phoenix in July basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transportation officials report a record number of traffic accidents for the first eight days of July. You know why? The new hands-free cell phone law. People in LA aren't used to driving with two hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like the hands-free phone. You know why? Like, today, I was able to get a much closer shave. I could look in the rear view mirror without holding the phone and the shaver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jesse Jackson now apologizing to Barack Obama for some extremely crude comments he made about Obama after an interview on Fox News. Yeah, apparently Jackson didn't know the microphone was on, and he said some nasty stuff, yeah. So yet another reverend Obama has to distance himself from. The guy has the worst luck with preachers of anybody I know!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now investigating why Barack Obama's loaner charter jet had mechanical problems the other day. Remember he had to make an emergency stop in St. Louis? ABC News says the jet was previously used by Hillary Clinton. See, so Hillary let Barack borrow her plane. And it had problems. Wonder what that was all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the African-American cable network TV One is coming under fire for its plans to cover the Democratic convention but not the Republican convention. And, believe me, black Republicans are very upset, both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush was in Japan for the G8 summit. Again, another embarrassing incident at dinner. I guess President Bush sent his sushi back because it was cold. 'Throw that on the grill a little bit there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's teenage son...has released a poem calling for the destruction of America and the killing of all its allies. Imagine a kid writing something like that. Here's my question. Where are the parents?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party announced this week that Barack Obama will give his acceptance speech at an 80,000-seat stadium and that they will not serve fried food at the Democratic convention. ... Which begs the question, where are they going to find 80,000 Americans who don't eat fried food?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the G8 summit, President Bush met with the prime minister of India. Yeah. There was an awkward moment when Bush told the prime minister, 'I think I've been in your taxi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, with gas prices approaching $5 a gallon here in California, a lot of people are starting to use bicycles as transportation. ... In fact, coming in today, I saw Jesse Jackson backpedaling all the way.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you...haven't heard by now, on Fox News the other day, during an interview, Jesse Jackson, not realizing the mic was open, said some pretty nasty things about Barack Obama.&quot; Jackson &quot;made the comments when he thought the mic was off. ... Here's my question. Why would Jesse Jackson ever go anywhere unless the mic was on, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jesse...said he thought Barack Obama was talking down to black people by lecturing them on things like fatherhood and being a responsible husband. Jesse thought it was insulting, not only to him but to his former mistress and their love child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...I don't think Jesse learned his lesson,&quot; because today, &quot;he was overheard saying he wanted to cut off John McCain's Medicare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain is coming under fire for comments made by his top economic adviser, former Senator Phil Gramm, who called America 'a nation of whiners' and said the country is only in a 'mental recession.' ... Like the $5-a-gallon gas and the bank kicking you out of your house, that's all in your mind! You're just imagining that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Iran test-fired nine missiles, and the White House said this is the sort of thing...that could disrupt the Middle East peace process. Just when things are going so well. We had this big love fest going. All this does is ruin it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in American history, Congress' approval rating has fallen to just 9%. ... To give you an idea how bad that is, the oil companies are at 12%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Florida man is doing okay after being bitten by a rattlesnake while shopping at a Wal-Mart. Officials aren't sure where the rattlesnake came from. I don't know. Since it's Wal-Mart, maybe China! Possibly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you don't know, last night, Fox News aired video of Jesse Jackson where Jackson was caught saying he wants to cut Barack Obama's ***s off.&quot; This &quot;marks the nicest thing ever said about Barack Obama on Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jackson says he's been trying to apologize to...Obama for saying he wants to cut his ***s off, but Obama has not taken his calls. ... Apparently, Jackson is so mad&quot; about this that, &quot;once again, he's threatened to cut&quot; Obama's &quot;***s off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Ralph Nader says that, this November, he expects to be on the ballot in at least 45 states. Yeah. Yeah, Nader's exact quote was, 'I hope to screw things up in at least 45 states.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boeing announced that they are designing a new helicopter that is kept aloft by helium. ... Yeah, Boeing is calling their new helicopter a balloon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whew! Hot in the valley this week, wasn't it? Over 100 degrees. In fact, actually, Phil Gramm said it was a mental heat wave and we're all a bunch of whiners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Phil Gramm, he's under for calling Americans 'a bunch of whiners.' He also said, 'The country is in a mental recession.' See, we're experiencing mental slowdown. That's kind of like President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week the Senate approved a new eavesdropping bill which means they're now allowed to listen to what you say without you knowing it. Yeah, yeah. You know who is really upset about this? Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush signed a bill giving phone companies immunity for letting the government spy on its customers without a warrant. Isn't that unbelievable? President Bush said 9/11 changed everything. And you know, he's right. Because violating the Constitution, breaking the law, used to mean jail time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, the plane that Barack Obama was on had some mechanical difficulties. Remember, he was forced to land? Well, the National Transportation Safety Board did an inspection on the plant. You know what they found? The bolts were fine. The bolts on the plane were fine. But apparently, Jesse Jackson has taken some of the nuts off the plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson said he &quot;wanted to cut Barack Obama's testicles off. And Jesse has been on several news programs the last couple of days explaining what he meant by those comments. Do you need to explain that? 'Cut off your testicles? What could that mean?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders claim that although Jesse Jackson supports Barack Obama publicly for president, privately, he doesn't like him. You know, it's kind of like Bill with Hillary. It's the same thing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, today Jesse tried to reach out to Obama. And Obama said, 'Keep your hands where I can see them!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are saying that the media is biased toward Barack Obama. ... He does get the better magazine covers. ... Look, here's Barack Obama. He's on the cover of Time, okay? Newsweek, Rolling Stone. Now, I don't want to be unfair, but now look at this. Like for example, McCain, he's on the cover of 'Codger Beat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's New York Times, you heard about this? Has once again raised the issue that John McCain may not be eligible to be president because he's not a natural born US citizen. That's what they're saying, yeah. Apparently, McCain was born outside of the 13 colonies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jesse Jackson says he's trying to put his remarks about cutting Barack Obama's nuts off...behind him. And he says that Obama has accepted his apology. Yeah. In fact, if he's elected, Obama says he'll appoint Jesse Jackson secretary of nut cutting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Barack Obama was endorsed by the US Black Golfers Association. Yeah. Could make the difference, yeah. Not only that, Obama was also endorsed by the Association of Asian Hockey Players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Hillary Clinton appeared at a fund raiser with Barack Obama, and Obama told the crowd that Hillary rocks. That's what he said. Yeah, then Bill Clinton said the same thing, but he was talking about Hilary Duff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's two daughters are very excited because, I guess, Barack Obama promised the kids after the election, he's going to get them a dog. ... And the good news, Jesse Jackson has offered to neuter it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Jesse Jackson speaking? When he thought the microphone was off, said he would like to cut Barack Obama's testicles off. And in a rare example of bipartisan support, Larry Craig of Idaho offered to guard them for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Jesse Jackson backtracking a little bit. He now says he was misunderstood. What he meant to say -- he was nuts about Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says he worries about everybody in America who might lose their job, unless they work for the New Yorker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Yorker magazine coming under fire for this week's cover, showing Barack Obama in a turban, Michelle Obama with a machine gun, and a burning American flag in the fireplace. Show the cover. Look at this. It's supposed to be satire. And yeah, people are really upset. Even Jesse Jackson went, 'What the hell are you thinking?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comedian Bernie Mack criticized for what some people thought was 'inappropriate comedy material' at a Barack Obama rally this past week. And he's not the only comedian being criticized. Oh, no, no. Apparently, Soupy Sales got a little carried away with the seltzer bottle at a John McCain rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm not sure if President Bush is on top of this whole financial situation. It always makes me nervous. Like when reporter asked today what he thought about Fannie Mae, he said, 'I love their chocolates. Their candy is delicious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's economic adviser, former Texas Senator Phil Gramm, is also coming under fire for calling America 'a nation of whiners.' That's what he said. We are a nation of whiners. And President Bush weighed in on the issue today. Again, he doesn't understand these things. Bush said today, 'We are not whiners. The average American still prefers beer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush lifted the presidential ban on offshore drilling that was imposed by his father, the first President Bush, 18 years ago. But hey, remember Bush's dad also said invading Iraq would be a huge disaster, and cutting taxes would ruin the economy. So what the hell did he know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush did some research this past weekend in order to better education himself on whether or not to drill for oil in Alaska. He said he did technical research on the latest drilling technologies. Okay, he just went to see 'Journey to the Center of the Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had his annual checkup this weekend. And his doctors were shocked. He is still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said today he would be interested in serving as Barack Obama's energy czar. At least, I think that's what he said. He might have said ? 'Yeah, I would like to have an energy bar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of embarrassing moment on the campaign trail today. Somebody gave Senator John McCain one of those new iPhones. And McCain thought it was a clicker for the garage door, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A pastor in Frankfurt, Kentucky, has been arrested for using poisonous snakes in his sermon. You ever seen those? Using poisonous snakes. Just when Barack Obama thought he found a new church, this happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had his annual checkup, had his annual physical, Dick Cheney, Vice President. Went well. During the checkup he only had three heart attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush announced he is lifting the executive ban on offshore drilling. Yeah. Going to lift the ban on offshore drilling. Yep. Yeah, that's true. Yep. Yeah, the President made the announcement during a speech entitled 'Ah, What The Hell?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain admits that his staff has to show him Websites, because he has trouble getting on the internet by himself. That's what he said. Yeah. Yesterday, McCain tried to surf the Internet for half an hour until his staff told him he was actually holding an Etch-a-Sketch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin, I want to thank you all for standing in line in such an orderly manner. Don't worry, you'll get all your money you have deposited. Please be patient!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that Indymac Bank that collapsed here in California? All those poor people waiting in line -- my God. But the Feds say not to worry if your money's in a bank, 'cause the government will guarantee it will be there. Remember, they also guaranteed WMDs and guaranteed New Orleans that FEMA would show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this scandal's a lot worse than the government is admitting. Like today, I went to the bank, not only did they not have my money, they also wanted me to give back the blender they gave me when I opened the account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke about the economy today. Did you hear what President Bush said today? He said, 'I am not an economist.' Not an economist? He's barely even a president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush lifted the executive ban on drilling for oil in certain parts of the country. ... Now, don't confuse that with President Clinton. He was the first to lift the executive ban on drilling in the Oval Office. That was totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, Barack Obama revealed that he and Michelle had their first kiss while sitting on a curb after he bought her a Baskin and Robbins. ... I think that's nice. Usually, when you see a guy buying a date an ice cream cone and asking for a kiss, it's on 'Dateline Predator.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In San Francisco, a 75-year-old woman came out of retirement to start a new career as a stripper. 75 years old. See, that's when you know we got to do something about Social Security, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not going well between Madonna and her brother after he released his controversial new book, 'Life With My Sister, Madonna.' Yeah, yeah. I don't want to say Madonna's mad at him, but I understand today, she called Jesse Jackson looking for a favor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, we're in the middle of a banking crisis. Today on television, President Bush assured Americans that he is taking steps to resolve the financial crisis. Well, that's good enough for me. Come on, let's go to the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brett Favre says he has reconsidered his decision to retire and he wants to get back in the game. Today Hillary Clinton said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, big story, Barack Obama called for African-Americans to be better parents. Yeah. That's what he said. Obama said not all black children can be raised by Angelina Jolie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comedian Bernie Mac performed at a recent Democratic fundraiser. And after he performed at the fundraiser, Barack Obama told him to clean up his act because some of his jokes were about sex and prostitution. Yeah, unfortunately, Bernie Mac couldn't hear Obama's advice because Bill Clinton kept screaming, 'Encore!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the second time in two days, John McCain has referred to current events in Czechoslovakia, a country that officially ceased to exist in 1993. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with all this financial panicking going on, President Bush held a press conference and told everyone to take a deep breath. 'Take a deep breath.' That's a good advice, huh? The economy is tanking and he's giving Lamaze classes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Take a deep breath.' Isn't that what he told the people of New Orleans when the water was rising?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said in his press conference our nation's troubled financial system is basically sound. Really? I mean, banks have folded, mortgage lenders are going under, basically sound? I think 'basically screwed' is probably more like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama announced today he's gonna visit Israel. He said he's going to stop at the West Bank. To which Bush said, 'The West Bank? Is that one going under, too? Oh, my God!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain spoke to the NAACP today. He went by his rap name, Ol' Cranky Bastard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain had to follow Barack Obama at the NAACP. That's like Wilford Brimley trying to follow Miley Cyrus at the teen choice awards. Good luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest polls show Barack Obama and John McCain are dead even. Dead even. See, what happened was Obama moved to the right and McCain moved to the left and they became the same person.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain has admitted he does not use e-mail or the Internet. Yeah. He says he's never really found the need to use e-mail 'cause if people want to reach him they can just get him on his CB radio.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has &quot;a new ad out now, a new ad that focuses on his experience. See, the one thing he has over the other candidate, Barack, he's got a lot more experience. See, show that new ad that just came out today.&quot; McCain &quot;ad&quot;: &quot;Barack Obama says he's devoted 20 years of his life to public service. That's nothing compared to John McCain. Way back when, John McCain helped Thomas Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence. And before that, when the pyramid workers lost their benefits, John McCain helped them form a union. John McCain even helped Noah gather up animals for the ark. Vote for John McCain. He's older than dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &quot;says he plans to revisit New York City this fall. You know, I'm surprised he's coming back. 'Cause you know how people in New York usually greet him when they see him? 'Taxi! Taxi!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, John McCain has now vowed to capture Osama bin Laden. Well, by God, I'm glad that's settled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not to be outdone, Barack Obama announced he will get us out of the All-Star game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most voters think Barack Obama &quot;has a better smile than John McCain. Yeah, apparently, this is because McCain takes his smile out every night and puts it in a glass of water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Bush Administration added the one millionth name to the US terrorist watch list. The millionth name, yeah. So congratulations to Peggy Watkins of Phoenix, Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a press conference about the economy. He said we're in 'a time of uncertainty.' Yeah. Yeah, then Bush said, 'You know, like that moment after 'Dora the Explorer' ends, but before 'Spongebob' starts?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes when president Bush speaks, he does not use the best choice of words. You know? Like, today, he said the financial institutions are basically sound, and you can take that to the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his press conference yesterday, President Bush said, 'I don't have a magic wand.' Like a magic wand is the answer? Is that the answer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, okay -- the last President allegedly had a magic wand. You saw how much trouble he got into.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke...testified before Congress yesterday. I don't want to say the financial situation doesn't look good, but he testified via satellite from the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Feds say Federal institutions are in trouble for giving money to those already in debt. That's the problem. They gave money to those already in debt. So, why are we paying taxes? Who's more in debt than the&quot; government? &quot;What are they, $9 trillion in debt? We're giving them more money? We're enablers. We need to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Florida state health official named Holly Benson is in trouble after she said...that the economic downturn, the recession, can be beneficial 'cause being poor and unemployed means you have more time to go jogging and stay in shape.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, today, John McCain was asked how he is going to conserve energy. And he said by taking three to four naps a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week in 1790, Washington, DC was named the capital of the United States. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday down in the White House lawn President Bush and all the boys&quot; got &quot;together and had a T-ball game. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are playing T-ball on the lawn of the White House. George Bush and the Vice President and Condoleezza, all the folks down there playing T-ball. Beautiful summer day, playing T-ball. Let's see, bank failures all over the United States. Record oil prices. A war with no end in sight. Well sure, let's play some T-ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporters assigned to Barack Obama say that this whole week, Obama has been working out like crazy at a gym. He's also been playing hours of basketball. Yeah. Meanwhile, John McCain has joined a group of mall walkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does that help the people in the burn area, having Arnold and the President flying over, looking down? 'Yeah, you're right. This is burned. You're not liars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say gas prices should fall by up to 3 cents a gallon over the next two weeks. ... Of course, the sad part -- with all these banks going under, Americans don't have a safe place to put those huge savings!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush says the economy is basically sound. Here's one of those situations where your mileage may vary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went on to say today there are no short-term solutions to the energy crisis. Apparently, there are no second term solutions either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more bad news for these IndyMac Bank customers. To give you an idea how bad it is at that IndyMac Bank, Kevin Federline's last CD is now worth more than your IndyMac CD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See Barack Obama on the news? He's becoming a workout fanatic. He's at the gym, like, twice a day, sometimes three times a day at the gym, yeah, according to his staff. Well, he has to stay in shape to do those flip-flops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, but President Bush,&quot; he also &quot;works out a lot. He's very fit. ... The country's in bad shape but, oh, he's riding that bike every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain said that Social Security is broke and will soon run out of money. In fact, today, McCain even told reporters his Social Security number. It's eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And human rights activists have sent a letter to President Bush, asking him to raise human rights issues with the Chinese government during the Olympics. Unfortunately, they also sent a letter to the Chinese government asking them to bring up human rights issues with President Bush. So, it's pretty much a wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the military trial of Osama bin Laden's driver begins today. ... Do you know what they got him for? Breaking the new cell phone hands-free law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you catch bin Laden's driver and not bin Laden? What, is he hiding down under the seat in the back of the car? Didn't the guy pick him up every day at his house? How do you not -- I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 63 years ago this week, the first atomic bomb test explosion occurred in New Mexico. That's what it said in the papers today, it 'occurred.' Doesn't that sound a little too laid-back for an atomic bomb? 'Hey, Martha, did you see what just occurred over there? The mountain melted. Oh, and I'm blind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the Center[s] for Disease Control, Mississippi is the most obese state in the country. ... In fact, you know what a lot of people in Mississippi did when they got this report? They deep fried it and ate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is an amazing statistic. I find this almost hard to believe. In California, one out of every four high school students drops out. ... And here's the sad part -- the other three are sleeping with the teacher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disney planning to open a new Disneyland theme park in Shanghai, China, in 2012. ... Of course, there'll be subtle changes to the Chinese Disneyland. Like, instead of the traditional parade down Main Street, they're going to have the 'Try and Stop the Tank.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dalai Lama says while he loves President Bush, he feels President Bush has a lack of understanding about reality. And in response, President Bush said today, 'Yeah, right, like there's such a thing as a talking llama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, new Batman movie opens tonight. ... In this one, Batman faces the most evil villain yet, a Countrywide Mortgage lender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to HBO for the miniseries, 'John Adams,'&quot; which &quot;got 23 Emmy nominations. ... You know what's unique about John Adams? Not only was he a president, later his son, John Quincy Adams, became president and was known as our smartest president.&quot; So, &quot;apparently, history does not repeat itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Birthday, Senator Larry Craig,&quot; who turns &quot;63 years old on Sunday. ... He has a big party planned. Earlier today, he shoved invitations under all the stalls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if are you going to Larry Craig's birthday party,&quot; it will be &quot;easy to find.&quot; Just &quot;look for the airport men's room with the balloons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see a lot of strange, interesting things in New York City. For example, on my lunch hour today, I walked up through Central Park. And this was crazy. I saw Jesse Jackson&quot; going &quot;after a squirrel's nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing things a little differently tonight...because Sen. John McCain is here. ... You see, normally on Friday, we would tape our show at 4:30. But to accommodate Sen. McCain, we agreed to tape the show at 5:30. Yeah. Yeah, Sen. McCain wasn't available at 4:30 because that's when he eats dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to President Bush's time in office as quote, 'a total failure.'&quot; Bush &quot;defended himself, saying, 'Oh, come on, I've hardly spent any time in my office.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of Cuba announced today that by the year 2010, Cuba will have high-speed Internet service. ... Not only that,&quot; but by &quot;2011, Cuba will have a computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, what a weekend at the box office. ... 'Batman,' of course, the number one movie, breaking all records. It made $155 million this weekend. In fact, the only place that had longer lines&quot; was IndyMac Bank, where customers were &quot;trying to get their money out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One &quot;character in the movie is Two-Face, who appears one way from one side, but is totally different from the other side. I believe he was played by Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think Osama bin Laden sees these 'Batman' movies and goes, 'Oh, now that's a cave?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard the trial has begun for Osama bin Laden's driver. ... I understand during the trial, bin Laden will just wait in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in political news, there was a huge reception for Barack Obama in the Middle East this past weekend. People were screaming, chasing him, hanging on his every word -- and that was just the US press corps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama also went to Afghanistan. And Bill Clinton went with him. ... Well, at least that's what he told Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain's economic adviser Phil Gramm has quit the campaign. The official reason -- he was a whiner and all his problems were mental.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes. You know about him? Remember, he said we're a nation of whiners? ... And then he resigned. Well, doesn't that make him a quitter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, experts say gas prices should fall by up to three cents a gallon over the next week. Three cents a gallon, how about that? Well, this is...just in preparation for gas rising to $8 a gallon by Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China says it will ban entertainers they deem a threat to the government from taking part in any activities during the Olympics. You make fun of the government, you'll be banned from the Olympics, to which Bush said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A religious group at Southern Methodist University says they are opposed to having a George W. Bush think tank. Not on religious grounds, just logic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions Asked Of Barack Obama On His Trip Overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Which countries do you plan to invade based on faulty intelligence?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Seriously, why the hell do you want this job?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Are you looking for a great deal on a used camel?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'If you want to visit a war zone, how about the Alex Rodriguez marriage?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'So is Lindsay Lohan actually dating that chick?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Can you explain the 'feels like' number?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'How many Obamas still living in Ireland?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'If you're elected, will you be an entertaining dumb-ass like Bush?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Can you do anything about Andy Dick?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Do you know Batman?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so hot today that Vice President Dick Cheney replaced his pacemaker with an icemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody go to Yankee Stadium yesterday?&quot; Rudolph Giuliani &quot;took his buddy John McCain to the&quot; game. And &quot;did you know this? It was Old White Guy Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that John McCain. He looks like the guy they'd send out to the mound to settle down a young pitcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain kept asking Giuliani, 'When's DiMaggio coming up?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Attorney General Janet Reno&quot; is &quot;70 years old today. ... She looks great and she feels great. And as a matter of fact, she's even thinking about playing again for the Packers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, Barack Obama is over in the Middle East. Hey, did you see him playing basketball with our troops in Iraq? Did you see that one shot he made from 40 feet? ... Let me tell you something. If shooting baskets is now a requirement to be president, a white guy may never have that job again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, very popular in the Middle East. I guess a lot of people over there saw the cover of 'The New Yorker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is Barack's third day in the Middle East, and President Bush says he has no timetable for bringing him back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain called a press conference today. Unfortunately, all the press were out of the country covering Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you've got to feel kind of sorry for McCain. I mean, all day on TV, they show nothing but footage of Barack Obama touring the Middle East, being with the troops in Afghanistan, meeting with troops in Iraq. The only time I saw McCain on TV was when Willard Scott wished him a happy birthday on the 'Today' show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people think to take some of the spotlight off of Barack Obama, that John McCain will announce his vice presidential choice this week. And most people think it's going to be Mitt Romney. ... See, I don't know&quot; about that, because &quot;when Romney and McCain stand together, doesn't it look like one of those slick Countrywide lenders trying to trick your grandfather into a reverse mortgage?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week the trial began for Osama bin Laden's driver. He was pretty easy to catch. I guess they got him at the airport at the gate. He had a big sign that said Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think this guy is being totally honest,&quot; because &quot;he claims he didn't know where bin Laden lives, even though he was his driver. Yeah. He said whenever he drove bin Laden around, he was always blindfolded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush gave the US Olympic Team a rousing sendoff to the Olympics. Again, I don't think President Bush is that up on geography. Like, he told the athletes to get there a couple of days early to acclimate themselves to the fact that China is upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks announced last week they're closing 600 locations. And now, customers and city officials have sent impassioned pleas to keep these coffee shops open.&quot; They even &quot;started a 'Save Our Starbucks' campaign. Well, see, this shows what odd people we are. Factories close down, jobs go overseas, nothing. Close a Starbucks, 'No!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is calling the Bush Presidency 'a total failure.' ... I think he's done okay, if you don't count Iraq, the economy, the environment, Afghanistan, the mortgage crisis,&quot; the &quot;deficit, gas prices, Hurricane Katrina, illegal wire tapping, the national debt, tainted food, failure to catch bin Laden, CIA Leak. Other than that, I think it's been pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain...said&quot; recently that Iraq and Afghanistan share a common border, and &quot;I thought, well no wonder we can't find Osama bin Laden. We've been searching an imaginary border.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, by the way, the trial for Osama bin Laden's driver&quot; has &quot;begun.&quot; The charges are &quot;terrorism, conspiracy,&quot; and &quot;making an illegal left turn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this&quot; driver &quot;was a very devoted employee,&quot; and &quot;you could often see him. I saw him, I think, one time at the airport...holding up a sign up that read 'deranged lunatic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like celebrity birthdays?&quot; Former Attorney General Janet Reno &quot;has a birthday.&quot; She is now &quot;70 years old.&quot; Like &quot;everybody else, Janet is getting older. This could be her last chance to win a gold medal in shot put.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama was in Israel today.&quot; Did &quot;you see Barack wearing the traditional Jewish yarmulke? He looked very Jewish. Yeah. In fact, Jesse Jackson said, 'I'd like to circumcise him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, NBC news defended their coverage of Barack Obama. They've been accused of giving him more favorable treatment than John McCain, and today, NBC news denied it. They said, 'That's ridiculous. We've never even heard of John McCain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, you know, I don't want to...say McCain is running a lackluster campaign, but his Secret Service codename is 'Bob Dole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I tell you, everybody is keeping an eye on this Hurricane Dolly today. For most of the morning, Dolly was moving about seven miles per hour,&quot; which is &quot;about the same speed FEMA moves at during a hurricane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush commented on the storm, saying, 'My thoughts and prayers go out to all the oil rigs -- I mean people -- in the area.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Olympic track star Marion Jones has asked President Bush to commute her six month jail sentence for lying about performance-enhancing drugs. Yeah. However, Bush has indicated he will not commute the sentence to someone convicted of lying, unless, of course,&quot; that person's &quot;name is Scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' the new trend in vacations now is to have your kids cook for you. ... A lot of hotels offered something called 'Little Chefs' programs,&quot; which involve kids cooking &quot;for their parents. They have something similar in China,&quot; where they &quot;gather up large groups of children, put them in a warehouse and they make sneakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Kevin Costner on the show tonight. He has...a new movie out called 'Swing Vote,' where he plays a man whose one vote will determine the presidential election. Now, I know that seems a little far-fetched, one person determining who becomes president, but remember, Bush did it with just nine people.&quot; So the film's premise is &quot;not that farfetched.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you realize that Osama bin Laden had a driver? Well, they caught the guy and they arrested him and he's now on trial.&quot; But this guy &quot;loved working for Osama bin Laden. And maybe you saw him at airports&quot; waiting &quot;for Osama bin Laden. He was the guy holding the sign that said, 'fanatical whack job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is&quot; in the Middle East, &quot;and today, he met with the leaders of Israel and Jordan, and not to be outdone, earlier today, John McCain was in the park playing checkers with Ed Koch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But people&quot; in the Middle East &quot;love...Barack Obama, and I think the reason that they love the guy is because...finally,&quot; they have found &quot;a guy that can pronounce Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're watching right now from in or near Brownsville, Texas, you should probably turn the TV off and get...out of there, because Hurricane Dolly made landfall today. ... I know they have only so many names to...choose from&quot; with these hurricanes, &quot;but how are you supposed to take a hurricane named Dolly seriously?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is in the Middle East. He's in Israel today, while poor John McCain was stuck in&quot; the &quot;cold cuts section&quot; of &quot;a supermarket in Pennsylvania. ... 'Excuse me, Senator, could I get the Kraft Singles? I'm just...just for a second.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not going particularly well for John McCain. He's way behind in the polls and today there was a story that Obama-related merchandise...is outselling John McCain merchandise by a four-to-one margin. Although ? and this is important to know -- McCain does still have a very strong lead when it comes to sales of both the McClapper and the McDiaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all hear about 'American Idol'? He was in Berlin today, yeah! Very exciting!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today in Berlin, Barack Obama spoke to a crowd of over 200,000 people. In fact, he was so eager to please the Germans, he promised he'd name David Hasselhoff as vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, history shows it's pretty easy to get a big crowd of Germans together. The problem comes when they start marching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard John McCain's new campaign slogan? 'Hey, guys, I'm over here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell McCain is starting to get a little desperate to get publicity. In fact, last night he was photographed leaving A-Rod's hotel room at 2:00 in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad things are for McCain right now, the only way he could get less coverage is if he got a primetime show on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was leaked yesterday&quot; that &quot;John McCain could be leaning towards Tim Pawlenty&quot; as &quot;a possible vice presidential running mate,&quot; and &quot;I know what you're thinking -- the Tim Pawlenty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, McCain wants to lower his profile even more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not even sure who Pawlenty was, so I googled him and it said, 'Who?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's governor of Minnesota, is that what it is? Pawlenty. Doesn't it sound like a dish at the Olive Garden?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, it is a dead tie right now, just about, between the two candidates. McCain said he'd balance the budget in a year. Barack Obama said that he'd bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I don't know who not to believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest on John Edwards' vice presidential chances. Too much vice, not enough presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard this story? ... The 'National Enquirer' claims they caught...Edwards visiting his mistress at 2:40 in the morning at the Beverly Hilton Hotel Monday night. And when a team of reporters confronted him, he ran and...hid in the men's room! And you know who was in there? Senator Larry Craig. What are the odds?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the price of oil has dropped to under $125 a barrel for the first time in two months, and...gasoline is down six cents a gallon. You know what this means. The White House will call for an emergency bailout to help the struggling oil companies. 'We've got to stop the bleeding! This is horrible!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US Geological Survey has announced that the Arctic may hold 90 billion barrels of oil, which is enough to supply US demand for 12 years. But they say reaching it under all that ice is the problem. See, that's the genius of Bush's economic policies. Thanks to global warming, the ice will melt and he can get at the oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at a recent fundraiser, President Bush said the economy is in bad shape...because 'Wall Street got drunk and now it's got a hangover.' A hangover? Has he seen the news lately? You know, it's more like Wall Street got drunk&quot; and &quot;spent all night with its head in the toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff,&quot; terrorists &quot;from England are trying to enter the United States. When President Bush heard the news, he warned travelers to be on the lookout for anyone speaking English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the former driver for Osama bin Laden is on trial for war crimes. Prosecutors say even if they can't get a guilty verdict, they can at least send him to one of those all-day traffic schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I don't know if you know this or not, but right now Barack Obama is in the Mideast. And when he was over there, he met with the Israelis, also met with the Palestinians. But...not to steal the spotlight, John McCain also had a very busy day. He spent the entire day in the waiting room of Just Tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama was in Germany&quot; today, and &quot;he did this speech and 100,000 people showed up. There were so many Germans shouting and screaming that France...surrendered just in case.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Barack Obama was in Germany today. A huge crowd turned out to hear him speak ?more than 200,000 people cheering him enthusiastically. Yeah, I guess it's the first time they've seen a black person since Milli Vanilli left the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was...surprising&quot; and &quot;kind of exciting. They really love Barack Obama in Germany. He's like a rock star over there,&quot; which is &quot;impressive until you realize that David Hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a great week for Obama. To say that he won the photo-op battle this week&quot; against John McCain &quot;is like saying Batman did okay at the box office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this is going to seem like a joke, but I did a Google News search today for the phrase 'John McCain,'&quot; and it turned up no results. Fortunately, McCain &quot;doesn't know how to get on the Internet, so it probably won't bother him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you've heard&quot; that Barack Obama was &quot;elected chancellor of Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, Barack Obama was in the Fatherland,&quot; while &quot;John McCain was in Grandfather Land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Barack Obama is in France today. And again, McCain doing everything to compete with him. Like today, he ordered the french toast combo at IHOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell the French are still a little gun shy. After speaking in front of 200,000 Germans yesterday, when Obama arrived in France today, they said, 'You came alone, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama landed in London just about an hour ago. ... And to prepare for his visit to England, he didn't brush his teeth for four days.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the Dalai Lama?&quot; He had a near-death experience today&quot; when he &quot;met with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you believe there are two Americas, then John Edwards is in trouble in both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mainstream media now starting to report a story that...John Edwards was caught leaving his girlfriend's hotel room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel at 2:00 in the morning.&quot; If &quot;this story turns out to be true, there go&quot; Edwards' &quot;chances of becoming vice president. He could still be governor of New York,&quot; though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Federal immigration officials arrested 43 illegal immigrants from Mexico in Hawaii! ... How lost were they? Boy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush called for building a fence around Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Puerto Rico, it is Constitution Day. ... So that's where the Constitution went.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Coast Guard closed over 100 miles of the Mississippi River after an oil spill of over 400,000 gallons of oil. The Federal government leaped into action...within 30 minutes of the spill. ... How does this make the people of New Orleans feel, huh? They get wiped out by Hurricane Katrina, it takes FEMA, what, six days to show up? A barrel of oil spills, the White House goes, 'No!' And they're down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Qantas Airlines 747 had to make an emergency landing after a giant hole ripped through the underside of the plane, causing it to fall 20,000 feet. Investigators say they don't believe it was a terrorist act. Whew! Well, that's got to be a relief for the passengers, huh, knowing their plane's just coming apart at the seams from neglect?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, in London, an environmental protester tried to glue himself to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ... See, we don't do that here. You want to get close to a politician here, you want him to stick, you need cash&quot; and &quot;lots of&quot; it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the city of Los Angeles has voted to ban all plastic bags starting in 2010,&quot; which &quot;is kind of ironic. So, if you're caught with marijuana, the pot is fine, but if it's in a plastic bag,&quot; you are in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caleb Campbell,&quot; who &quot;played college football for&quot; the Army at West Point, was &quot;drafted by the Detroit Lions a couple of months ago.&quot; But Campbell has now &quot;been told he cannot play football next season, because he has to fulfill his military duties. But he's not that upset. I think he realizes he's more likely to get shot playing in Detroit than he would be in the Army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during his concert in New York City, George Michael advised Barack Obama to pick Hillary Clinton as his running mate. ... Obama responded by saying he appreciated Michael's advice, but he's still waiting to hear from Boy George.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Obama campaign is coming out with a new line of pajamas. Did you hear about this? They're called 'Ojamas.'&quot; But John McCain &quot;already has his own line of bedtime clothes. They're called 'adult diapers.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. It was hot today, wasn't it? ... I was sweating like John Edwards looking at 'The National Enquirer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The National Enquirer' caught former presidential candidate John Edwards sneaking out of his girlfriend's room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel at 2:40 in the morning. ... See, if Edwards didn't want to get caught, he should have met this woman at the hotel where John McCain was staying. There are no reporters&quot; at that hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news earlier tonight that this political campaign has only 100 days left. ... I don't know what's less likely, Barack Obama getting enough experience in 100 days, or John McCain living another 100 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see where John McCain met with the Dalai Lama? That was pretty amazing. Yeah, the man millions believe goes back to the 7th century standing next to the Dalai Lama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama back from his big European tour. Did you see him in Europe? People were cheering him, holding up signs, blowing him kisses. And that was just the American media covering the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that California has become the 'first state in the nation to ban all trans fat.'&quot; At least &quot;I think that's what he said. He might have said, 'We're the first to can all trained cats.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 5-year-old boy in Denton, Texas, slipped out of a day care center, crossed a busy highway, and walked into a Hooters restaurant. ... When Bill Clinton heard this, he said, 'Son?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hooker who brought down&quot; former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, &quot;has just signed a $2 million deal to write a book, which is bad news for...Spitzer. Out of all the hookers in the world, he gets the one that's the author.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways John McCain Can Appear More Youthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Campaign in a batsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Instead of Lincoln, pepper speech with quotes from Broday Jenner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Get his Miracle Ear pierced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Stop yelling at reporters to get off his lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Play breakdancing vice principal in 'High School Musical 3.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Take a page from Jason Giambi and grow a cool moustache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Wrestle a gator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Change name of 'Straight Talk Express' to 'J-Dawg's Booty Wagon.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Stop promising a Packard in every garage and a goose in every icebox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Never hurts to nail a few interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the &quot;last ten days,&quot; Barack Obama &quot;was traveling overseas, campaigning in Europe and everywhere.&quot; And this trip was &quot;so successful&quot; that Obama &quot;is actually thinking about campaigning here in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while &quot;Barack Obama was campaigning in Germany,&quot; John McCain &quot;wasn't laying around. No, no, John McCain was out driving in his driveway and he backed over the mailbox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; there &quot;was one little episode while Barack Obama was overseas. He was in Jerusalem, and he was heckled. And he's not used to being heckled, because everybody...likes the guy wherever he goes so nobody heckles him. And this woman was just furious and nasty and heckling him,&quot; and &quot;finally he said, 'All right, Hillary, knock it off!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama went to the doctor today. He has a sore hip, apparently. Finally, the two presidential candidates have something in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, polls show that Barack Obama&quot; is &quot;more popular than John McCain in Germany, France, and Great Britain. However, John McCain leads in Mesopotamia, Gaul and the Holy Roman Empire,&quot; so &quot;it's pretty balanced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard about this group&quot; called &quot;Prayer at the Pump? They're a prayer group that springs up, and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices. Otherwise known as the Bush energy plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China says it's doing everything they can to help clean up air pollution before the Olympics. And they're taking this very seriously. In fact, they have got every 6-year-old in the country working 24 hours a day&quot; on the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you think I'm exaggerating,&quot; but they &quot;had a practice today in Beijing for the Olympics&quot; and a &quot;javelin thrower...threw the javelin up into the air and it stuck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, John McCain appeared on 'Larry King Live.' ... The show consisted of a five-minute interview and a 55-minute pee break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama announced that next month he wants to spend a week on vacation in Hawaii. ... Yeah, after hearing about it, President Bush said, 'I can't believe he's taking another trip to a foreign country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like Hillary Clinton still has a shot at being vice president. Yeah, if John McCain picks her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the latest gossip, you know,&quot; that &quot;Hillary Clinton is not particularly high on Barack Obama's vice presidential list. In fact, turns out she's somewhere between the Reverend Wright and Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, insiders say Hillary was never on Obama's VP list. Obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket. Bad enough to worry about Jesse cutting them off, he didn't want to have to worry about Hillary breaking them too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, John McCain had a small mole removed from his temple, to which President Bush said, 'Temple? I didn't know he was Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Congress officially apologized for slavery. Not a moment too soon, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to...the TV show 'Extra,' former Vice President Dan Quayle&quot; is &quot;in the running to join the cast of 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... Quayle...was vice president under the first George Bush. See, that was back in the day when the president was smart and the vice president was an idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course,&quot; a &quot;moderate earthquake hit California. ... Governor Schwarzenegger was giving a speech at the time, and the shaking was so great, you could actually understand what he was saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine says that many top Republicans are worried that lately John McCain has been taking too negative a tone. Yeah, when he heard...this, McCain said, 'Shut your pie holes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says that next month he's planning on spending a week on vacation in Hawaii.&quot; When &quot;he heard...this, President Bush said, 'Pace yourself, because once you become president, the vacations start coming fast and furious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A comic book publisher says he's trying to increase voter turnout in the presidential election by publishing comic books about John McCain and Barack Obama.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the great earthquake of '08. Don't worry, you're in good hands. I have been bolted safely to the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, we had a little earthquake yesterday here in Los Angeles. ... The rebuilding began today and ended today because nothing really broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the campaign's starting to get nasty. ... Have you seen the new commercial? The McCain campaign compares Barack Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. And today, the Obama campaign released an ad comparing John McCain to Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bea Arthur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, McCain not backing down. He's defending the commercial where he compared Barack Obama to Paris Hilton as being 'all talk, and little action.' That's what he said. Like Paris, Barack Obama is 'all talk and little action.' Really? Has he seen her sex video?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Obama's people are trying to portray McCain as cranky, and McCain is trying to portray Obama as arrogant, you see. And when Obama was asked what he thought about being called arrogant, well he said he was 'above having to answer that question.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when McCain was asked about being labeled cranky, he told the reporter to 'go to Hell!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama told Tom Brokaw the other day that what he's looking for in a vice president is a person who would tell him when they thought he was wrong. Well, if that's the case, wouldn't Hillary be the best candidate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Barack Obama also said someone who worked in the Clinton White House told him how important it was to have free time during the day to think. No offense, but I don't think Bill Clinton was using his free time to think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this? Exxon Mobil today reported a profit last quarter -- not last year, last quarter, 1/4 -- of $12 billion! ... But in their defense, that money didn't come from the gas. That's just from the mini marts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now say pond scum...could be our next oil. They say pond scum is actually a biofuel. See, I like this, because now we can call oil company CEOs pond scum executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more video from the earthquake keeps coming in. Today, they showed security camera footage of the earthquake hitting during a Los Angeles City Council meeting. ... You could actually see the lobbyists being shaken right out of the councilmen's pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one awkward moment on the news when they asked President Bush if he was going to visit the epicenter here in California. President Bush said, 'Uh, no, silly. The Epicenter is in Disney World in Florida.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Francisco could become the first city in the nation to ban the sale of tobacco products at pharmacies. Yeah. So a guy can't buy cigarettes, but he can marry the Marlboro Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN secretary-general has announced that he's raising the thermostat at the United Nations by five degrees to combat global warming, and also to show sensitivity to Third World diplomats who represent countries that don't have any air conditioning. Well, aren't they the ones who would appreciate it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs Your Cat Is Too Fat. &quot;6. When he goes outside, people say, 'Can I get your autograph, Mr. Gore?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new campaign ad, kind of an attack ad,&quot; from John McCain. In the ad, McCain, &quot;compares Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears,&quot; and McCain has been criticized for this. Reporters tried &quot;to contact McCain to get his response to&quot; the criticism, but McCain could not talk because he &quot;was busy having his dinner on a TV tray watching 'Jeopardy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, Barack Obama said he's distantly related to the famous 19th century gunslinger Wild Bill Hickock. ... After hearing this, John McCain said, 'Big deal. I went to high school with him.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on the hunt for a new home. ... I guess his master plan of massive foreclosures and plummeting real estate prices has finally paid off, because he should get a good deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's looking for something with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and zero libraries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that there are people actually jockeying to take the President's job? Vultures. It's shameless really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, his campaign, is criticizing today a new song from the rapper Ludacris. They specifically objected to Ludacris calling Hillary Clinton a bitch. Like they don't, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The song also calls President Bush mentally handicapped. A White House spokesperson today objected as well, saying that the official term for the President's condition is developmentally disabled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Missouri yesterday, Barack Obama claimed that he's a distant relative of Wild Bill Hickok. Apparently, he is. But John McCain said, 'Senator, I served with Bill Hickok, I know Bill Hickok, Bill Hickok was a friend of mine, and you are no Bill Hickok.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' ... What a crowd! You sound like Dick Cheney looking at Exxon's profits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exxon Mobil reported a second quarter profit of $12 billion,&quot; but that was &quot;actually below the Wall Street expectations for the company. So now, their stock shares have fallen as a result. Boy, what's that morning meeting like on Monday, huh? You call in the district managers. 'We only made $12 billion this quarter! My family has to eat!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, President Bush announced there are going to be some big changes in intelligence in the White House. Yeah, he's leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The John McCain campaign has accused Barack Obama of playing the race card. The Obama campaign has accused McCain of playing the pinochle card, so I don't know what's going to happen there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama accused Republicans of trying to make others fear him because, and I quote, 'He doesn't look like the other presidents on the dollar bill.' So the choice is, do you want to elect the guy who doesn't look like the President on the dollar bill, or do you want to elect the guy who looks older than the President on the dollar bill?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been mentioned that Barack Obama may still pick a woman for vice president, but not Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Well, today, a top Hillary Clinton supporter named Lanny Davis said it was inconceivable...that Obama would pick another woman over Hillary, to which Bill said, 'It's not that inconceivable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, that's the big talk. They say Barack Obama could decide to go with another woman. See, that's what killed John Edwards' chances of being vice president. He decided to go with another woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama told Tom Brokaw the other day on 'Meet the Press' that what he's looking for in a vice president is a person who will tell him when they thought he was wrong, to which president Bush said, 'Trust me. That gets old really fast.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new song by rapper Ludacris is causing some controversy for Barack Obama,&quot; because &quot;it attacks Hillary and Bush and John McCain in a very distasteful way. ... In fact, when John McCain heard that Obama had Ludacris on his iPod, he was stunned. He said, 'What's an iPod?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign has&quot; been running a commercial where they compare &quot;Barack Obama to various Hollywood celebrities.&quot; Because if &quot;there's one thing...Republicans will not stand for, it's electing some Hollywood celebrity to public office -- except for Ronald Reagan, Fred Thompson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood -- you know, except for those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new report by the Center for Immigration Studies,&quot; researchers &quot;report that the number of illegal immigrants in the US is down by 11%, and a lot of them are returning home. See, that's when you know the economy is bad, when illegal immigrants are fleeing to Mexico for a better way of life!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the US is going to do well, particularly in swimming,&quot; where &quot;Dick Cheney...looks great in the...freestyle waterboarding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's daughter announced she is writing a children's book based on her father's life. That's very nice. Yeah. The...children's book is called 'James and the Giant Prostate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Bill Clinton was giving a speech. He told a group of supporters that his wife Hillary is the person he most wants to spend time with. Yeah, apparently, Clinton likes to start off every speech with a joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had a tough day. He was forced to take a drastic measure. He had to lay off 22,000 state workers.&quot; But he &quot;did say, 'Hasta la vista, baby,' to everyone leaving, so that was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. All these young people&quot; here to see the Jonas Brothers. This &quot;is like the opposite of a John McCain rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very enthusiastic group&quot; here tonight. You &quot;sound like Congress going on their five-week vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress went on a five-week vacation starting today. And boy, they deserve it, don't they? They got so much done this year -- solved the energy crisis, healthcare, Social Security, immigration. Whew! Take a break, fellas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ever notice that Congress doesn't even call it a vacation?&quot; They &quot;call it&quot; a recess. You &quot;ever notice the only people that get recess are Congress,&quot; kindergarteners, and juries, the &quot;three groups you can't trust to make an adult decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you noticed this,&quot; but last week, &quot;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned the lights out on Congress while the Republicans were talking. She killed the microphones and turned the lights off. ... The Republicans called this 'outrageous,' except of course for Senator Larry Craig, who called it 'romantic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Hilton's mother very upset because John McCain has put Paris in his campaign video. ... Isn't that amazing? Of all the videos Paris Hilton's been in, this is the one Mom's upset about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, she said his ad featuring Paris is 'a complete waste of the country's time and attention.' It's like Paris, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, both Britney Spears and Paris Hilton have now commented on the John McCain political ad. And both of them said, 'Oh, who's John McCain?' So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign has accused Barack Obama of being 'elitist' and using the 'race card.' Yeah, yeah. The Obama campaign accused McCain of being 'old' and using the 'Discover Card.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the 'Boston Globe' reports that political experts are telling Barack Obama that when he's on vacation in Hawaii, he should stay away from loud Hawaiian shirts and Speedos. Well, isn't that pretty much good advice for any middle aged guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, Exxon getting hammered for showing a second quarter profit of $12 billion.&quot; Exxon, however, &quot;pledges most of these profits will go toward...exploring. Not&quot; for oil, though, &quot;just&quot; for &quot;new ways to screw the consumer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen these commercials where T. Boone Pickens...says he wants to rely more on natural gas and wind power for energy. And once again, President Bush, you know, I don't think he really understands alternative fuels. Like today, he said, 'How do you drill for wind?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say John McCain is 71, but people are now saying he may be older. No one knows for sure because his birth certificate was destroyed when the wagon train was attacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terman: &quot;Do you remember Hillary Clinton? ...

If you contribute $5 to erase&quot; her &quot;campaign debt, you can have dinner with her.&quot; For &quot; $10, you get to tie the lobster bib on her pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday was Barack Obama's birthday. I believe he turned a little to the right, if I'm not mistaken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he...turned 47 years old yesterday, had a big party for him. I don't know who sang happy birthday to him,&quot; but &quot;I think we can rule out Ludacris.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Obama's supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this, according to 'The Huffington Post,' it's being reported that Barack Obama may name Indiana Senator Evan Bayh as his vice presidential running mate tomorrow. ... Now here's what we know about Evan Bayh. He was going to run for president, then he dropped out after getting less than 2% of the vote&quot; so he &quot;was actually losing to low-fat milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama now says he's open to offshore oil drilling. So, apparently, when he promised change, he was talking about his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see McCain was at the country's biggest motorcycle rally&quot; in &quot;Sturgis, South Dakota.&quot; where &quot;all the Harley guys go. McCain showed up in a customized Rascal scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John McCain's daughter is now writing a children's book based on her father's life. See, the research has been difficult because, as you know, much of McCain's early life story is only available through folklore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen this ad from the McCain campaign where they compare Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears? Well, President Bush saw the ad today and he said, 'I had no idea Barack Obama didn't wear underwear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's a new movie opening this week called 'What We Do Is A Secret,' which I think was John Edwards' campaign slogan once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The National Enquirer,' John Edwards' mistress is getting $15,000 a month in hush money. No word on how much the main stream media is getting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; the &quot;price of oil is coming down. It's dropped from $147 a barrel all the way down to $118 a barrel today.&quot; The oil companies &quot;said they will pass those savings on to you 'as soon as hell freezes over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use, resulting in falling oil prices. So basically, the worse the economy is, the lower the oil prices, to which Bush said, 'That's been my energy plan all along!' This guy is a genius!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The psychological profile of that government bioterror scientist who just committed suicide -- you know, the guy that was going to be charged with the 2001 anthrax mailings, you know this story? Well according to...the report, he had a history dating back to his college days of homicidal threats, actions and plans, and that he was a sociopath. ... Gee, you'd think...that kind of background that would have disqualified him from something like, I don't know, handling anthrax for the government!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a death row inmate in Ohio is claiming he is too fat to be executed,&quot; because &quot;they wouldn't be able to find a vein in his arm to administer the lethal injection. ... Hey, inject it into a chocolate ?clair and let him eat it, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush flew to Alaska yesterday and then on to South Korea on his way to China. That shows you how much pull Bush has these days; can't even get a direct flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the Olympics haven't even started yet, did you know all the Olympic events are already available on bootleg DVDs in China right now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry King is getting divorced. Yep. And Larry, apparently, has had seven wives,&quot; which means he has had seven weddings. So it appears that Larry King &quot;is the cause of the rice shortage!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush...will be spending the entire week in the Orient,&quot; as opposed to his usual location, &quot;the Disorient...Thank you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush arrived in South Korea today. They had to use water cannons to push back the protesters.&quot; That &quot;shows you how times have changed,&quot; because when &quot;President Clinton visited South Korea, they used&quot; the same water cannons &quot;for the wet T-shirt contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of China says it's going to prevent rain at the Beijing Olympics by shooting dust into the clouds. ... Yeah, because that's the problem in Beijing ? there's not enough crap in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, yesterday, the government of China&quot; also &quot;guaranteed that the Beijing Olympics will be safe.&quot; But the &quot;fact is&quot; that the &quot;Chinese government knows the Olympics will be safe, because they've already written the next three weeks of news stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the moderators were announced for the upcoming presidential debates. ... Apparently, Barack Obama insisted on someone who asks even-handed, probing questions, while John McCain insisted on someone who will talk into his good ear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain does not want Dick Cheney to attend the Republican convention, because he says he's too unpopular. ... When asked to comment, Cheney said, 'I hope the Senator reconsiders.' Then he turned into a bat and flew away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Tropical Storm Edouard moved from the Gulf of Mexico and crossed into Texas. ... Experts say it's the first tropical storm to cross the Mexican border in the trunk of a Chevy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Ohio,&quot; a prisoner &quot;is claiming that he's too obese to be executed,&quot; but he &quot;says he could go for a last meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain was in Sturgis, North Dakota yesterday&quot; at the &quot;big...motorcycle rally&quot; that &quot;hundreds of thousands of Harley-Davidson owners&quot; go to every year. McCain &quot;actually rode there on his Rascal, so he got into the spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Congress went on recess, oil prices have dropped to $118 a barrel. That's, like, a $30 drop from the record high. You know, maybe Congress should take more vacations, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use, resulting in falling oil prices. Yeah. Basically, the worse the economy, the lower the oil prices, which means if Bush could serve one more term, oil would be free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Barack Obama and John McCain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling. They both used to be against it, but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances, like if it helps them get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big debate now, over this oil drilling thing. Democrats claim that if we did drill right now, it would take ten years before we'd ever saw a drop of oil. See, we've got the wrong people looking. We need Jed Clampett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to CNN, Vice President Dick Cheney is unlikely to attend the Republican convention this summer. That's when you know you're popular, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it's a logistical problem. Apparently, all the ambulances are already on standby for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on his way to China. His first order of business, meeting the 'Kung Fu Panda.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in China, the Olympic torch finally reached Beijing. Unfortunately, there's so much smog, today the torch lit the sky on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The International Olympic Committee is saying that the yellow-gray haze over Beijing is not pollution, it is only mist. ... Okay, it's lead mist, but still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And two athletes on the Chinese Olympic team were found to be under the legal age limit for Olympic competition, and Chinese authorities kicked them off the team, sent them back to the factory to make sneakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen China's slogan for the Olympics? Here it is. &quot;One world, one dream.' But see the asterisk? Go in close. What does it say? 'Restrictions apply, Tibet not included.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of this entire Brett Favre situation,&quot; which has &quot;turned out to be such a public relations disaster, the Green Bay Packers have hired President Bush's former spokesman Ari Fleischer. ... So you know what the Packers are going to do now? Invade Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in Beijing...has Olympic fever. ... Or, as it's also known, bronchial asthma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But yesterday, kind of an embarrassing moment in Beijing. The United States Olympic bicycle team gets off the plane, and they're wearing...those air filter masks on their&quot; faces. The &quot;'only way,' they say, 'that they're going to be able to get fresh air is to suck it out of their tires.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they're the same masks that kids have to wear when they play with Chinese-made toys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big debates are coming up.&quot; Barack Obama &quot;wants to debate about foreign policy,&quot; while &quot;John McCain wants to debate about the big band era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I like John McCain. He looks like the guy that hangs out at the driving range,&quot; always &quot;giving you unwanted tips. ... 'You're topping the ball. You're top -- give me the club. You're topping the damn ball!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But how about this? John McCain was at the big annual motorcycle rally&quot; in Sturgis, South Dakota. While there, McCain &quot;suggested that his wife could compete&quot; in the rally's &quot;topless beauty pageant.&quot; That &quot;reminds me of is the time during the campaign&quot; when Bill Clinton &quot;suggested that Hillary should compete in a wet pantsuit contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Beijing, a small group of demonstrators gathered to protest China&quot; repressive government. &quot;Yeah. Funeral services will be held on Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Barack Obama&quot; is &quot;still continuing to dominate media coverage. 'The New York Times' just did a big piece&quot; in which they &quot;say that Barack Obama has been successful in politics because he's a black man who doesn't make white people feel threatened,&quot; which &quot;explains Obama's Secret Service code name, 'Al Roker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the moderators for the presidential and vice presidential debates were announced. Two of them are from PBS. ... After hearing this, President Bush said, 'They got Bert and Ernie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you about this, but there is a formidable new combatant in the presidential race. Barely a week after John McCain used her image in an ad attacking Barack Obama, Paris Hilton is fighting back. Yesterday, she released her own political ad in which&quot; she &quot;talked about her own energy policy, which until this point I think had been...vodka and Red Bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...it's a comedy video,&quot; so &quot;it probably would have been funnier if anyone other than Paris Hilton was starring in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;new poll...done by the Lifetime Network&quot; has &quot;determined that more American women would rather carpool or go on vacation with Barack Obama more than John McCain -- 51% for Obama to 31%&quot; for John McCain. And &quot;that 31% fell to just 2% when it was specified that McCain would be driving in that carpool.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush is on a week-long tour to Asia, where he'll visit South Korea, Thailand and China -- or as the White House calls it, 'The everything sold at Wal-Mart tour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush arrived in Beijing earlier today. Again, I don't think he really understands the Olympics that well. Like, they asked him if he liked the decathlon, and he said, 'No,' he preferred 'regular coffee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview recorded by the BBC in Africa, Bill Clinton told people in Africa to practice monogamy and that we need to control unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners. In fact, the minute he said that, the Secret Service wrestled him to the ground and said, 'Who are you and what have you done with the real Bill Clinton?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama heading to Hawaii for a vacation with his family. And President Bush commented on that today. He said, 'First Europe, now Hawaii. Maybe he should spend some time campaigning in America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week on the Internet, Paris Hilton posted her own ad to spoof the ad John McCain made about her.&quot; The &quot;McCain camp responded by that by saying Paris Hilton supports McCain's approach to America's energy crisis. You know, how desperate is your presidential campaign when you have to try and convince people that Paris Hilton agrees with you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I'm not voting till I hear what Britney has to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you may have heard, Osama bin Laden's driver found guilty of supporting terrorism. Osama bin Laden very upset today. He said, 'From now on, when I hire a driver, I'm going to do a background check.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A government survey says that all...Americans will be overweight in 40 years. And here's the bad news. This study is 40 years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who used to be Osama bin Laden's...driver&quot; has &quot;been found guilty of supporting terrorism&quot; and &quot;using an expired EZ Pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this guy, Salim Hamdan, he wasn't just Osama bin Laden's driver. He drove for a lot of celebrities,&quot; but he &quot;said the only celebrity he ever really got along with was Mel Gibson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush arrived in Beijing earlier today. And before stepping out of the plane, he tested the air with a canary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they got together, the Chinese,&quot; and &quot;threw a big steak dinner for President Bush in his honor. They served Peking lame duck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, he doesn't know what he's doing over there. He turned to the president of China, and he said, 'General Tso, I love your chicken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Olympics start tomorrow in Beijing. People still concerned about the air quality. ... Earlier this week -- this is a true story -- a member of the International Olympic Committee said that the smog in Beijing isn't pollution, it's 'mist.'&quot; Then, &quot;he said, 'Just make sure not to get any mist in your eyes or lungs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama now is giving interviews where he's opening up about his life. The candidates want to reveal their personal side. In a new interview that just came out, Barack Obama said as a kid, he cried when he saw the movie 'Born free.' Very nice. Yeah. Yeah, meanwhile, John McCain said, as a kid, he cried because movies weren't invented yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Wilhelmina Bush is in China right now. He's been in Asia this week, with his wife Laura, his daughter Barbara, and the guy who ties his shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are there to watch the Olympics. Now, this may be the last major trip of the Bush Presidency. He is scheduled to take a day trip to Legoland in October, but this is the last big one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 60 heads of state will be at the opening ceremonies, so security is extremely tight in China, which has been very hard on the locals there. Many stores and factories in Beijing have been required to close, and people have been forced out of their houses. It's sort of like here in the United States, only for them, it'll end in a couple of weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government claims that it has the smog that Beijing is notorious for under control,&quot; but &quot;here's how bad&quot; it really is. They &quot;say if Snoop Dogg rolled down the window of his limo, smoke would pour in.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Olympics began today. The opening ceremonies tonight had 5,000 people, 205 different countries speaking 117 different languages. It was like being at a Dodgers game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, when you think about it, I mean, there are very few thing that really bring all the different countries of the world together . I mean, there's the Olympics, and, of course, hating America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear what happened today? One little setback, I guess. The gold medals tested positive for lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush arrived in China for the games. In fact, today, he spent the day driving around looking for a Panda Express.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people don't realize this is a first for President Bush, entering a foreign country where he is actually invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush met with the Chinese leader, President Hu Jintao. ... But once again, you know, President Bush, you know, he studies,&quot; but &quot;I think he was trying a little too hard to impress the Chinese president with his knowledge of Chinese culture. Like when they met, he said, 'Snatch the pebble from my hand, Grasshopper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was nice. At one point during the ceremony tonight, they had 56 children march in, all belonging to John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story 'ridiculous,' 'untrue,' and 'tabloid trash,' John Edwards today admitted he had an affair. And the 'National Enquirer' was the only publication writing about it. The 'National Enquirer' was the first to break it. Turns out it was true. Do you know what this means? Elvis is alive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Edwards apparently met this woman in a New York City bar in 2006. And he is a pretty smooth operator. ... Hear his opening line to the woman? 'So, which America are you from?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he actually said today, about the other woman, he doesn't love her. Oh, that's smart. Now you got two women mad at you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Democrats are furious. They are going on record now saying John Edwards will not...be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair. Yeah. Instead, speaking in his place, Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a military jury in Guantanamo Bay has given Osama bin Laden's driver a shockingly light sentence, five months in jail. You know, they gave him a five-and-a-half-year sentence with credit for five years he's already served. So, he'll be out in a couple of months. Do you know what that means? He'll be driving a cab in New York by Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study, coffee can improve your memory,&quot; which &quot;is good news for both Barack Obama and John McCain. If we can get them to have some coffee before their first debate, maybe they can remember what their original positions were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Barack Obama's slogan is 'Yes, we can.' Hillary's new slogan, 'No, you can't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about this? In a stunning announcement, Hillary Clinton is now telling people that she may want her delegates to vote at the convention for her. She hasn't given up yet. She's like Freddie Kruger in 'Nightmare on Elm Street.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that Paris Hilton ad about John McCain has gotten over 5 million hits on the web. ... Isn't that amazing? More people have seen the ad than have seen John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And porn star Jenna Jameson is pregnant. Boy, that John Edwards gets around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today&quot; was the &quot;opening of the Chinese Olympics in Beijing,&quot; and the &quot;opening ceremonies earlier tonight&quot; were &quot;just tremendous -- 10,000 performers...reenacted the history of communist China. I mean, cut me a slice of that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beijing Olympics ? it's two weeks of competition to see which country has the best pharmacists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, now sometimes I feel sorry for President Bush. Sometimes I get the feeling he's in over his head, because he's at the opening ceremonies,&quot; and &quot;he's trying to, you know, pretend like he knows what he's doing. So he turns to the president of China and he says, 'I love your chicken, General Tso.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush made &quot;history&quot; by becoming the &quot;first sitting US president to attend the Olympics in a foreign country. He said he's been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in China, people aren't allowed to make fun of political leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For China, the Olympics are an opportunity to try to change the world's perception of them. And they put on quite an opening ceremony. They say it cost $300 million to produce, and it might have even been more expensive if they didn't have slaves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One interesting aspect of the games is that the athletes are getting older. This time around, there are...a whole bunch of athletes more than 40 years old,&quot; which &quot;just goes to show that with discipline, modern training techniques, and clean urine purchased on the black market, dreams can come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all enjoy the Olympic Games? I thought it was great. It was very exciting. Though there was one...very emotional moment at the opening ceremonies, where they had children representing each of the 56 ethnic groups in China march into the stadium. Then the farmers and the sneaker factories said, 'Okay, break's over, back on the bus. Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how about that one American female competitor who got robbed of her silver medal, huh? What was her name? Oh, Hillary Clinton. Yeah, that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, at the Democratic Convention this week in Denver, both Bill and Hillary will be speaking. Not to each other, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know by now, Barack Obama sent out a cell phone text message at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday morning to tell everyone he picked Joe Biden as his vice president. How do you think this makes Hillary Clinton feel, huh? Finally gets a phone call at 3:00 a.m., it's to tell her they picked Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you could see Obama was trying a little too hard to connect with young voters with the text message. I still have it on my phone. ... It says, 'Oh, my God. Me and Biden are best friends forever. Ta-ta for now. Smiley face.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? Although Joe Biden is in great physical condition, the Republicans are raising questions about his health now. I guess he had a brain aneurysm a couple of years ago. ... Hey, you can't expect every vice president to be the picture of health like Dick Cheney, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very excited to have&quot; Sen. John McCain &quot;here tonight. You see, it's always a thrill to have the guest on the show who, in a few short months, could be president of the United States. You know, usually...when we have a big guest on the show, by the end of the month, they're in rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, John McCain is an older white haired man who has been in the Senate over 20 years, voted for the Iraq war, and said Barack Obama did not have the experience to be president. I'm sorry, that's our intro for next week when Joe Biden is on. I'm sorry, I got confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in other news, Tropical Storm Fay has soaked Florida, ruining thousands of homes,&quot; most &quot;of them belonging to John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, to make Sen. McCain feel at home tonight, gave him seven dressing rooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to speak the first night of the Republican Convention.&quot; And the &quot;Republicans are now...fighting over who gets to follow him, because after Bush speaks, even Elmer Fudd sounds like Laurence Olivier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick will not be going to the Democratic Convention. Yeah, having some problems. As you know, he originally got in trouble for allegedly having an affair and then lying about it, to which John Edwards said, 'That's illegal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this John Edwards thing? ... Imagine that, a personal injury attorney who turns out to be a sleaze ball. Who could have seen that coming?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards has admitted to having an affair, but he's denying that he is the father of the woman's baby. In fact, he says a member of his campaign staff is the baby's father. Campaign staff, how does that work? What, was Edwards running late that day? Huh? Had to send an advance man in? 'Look, I can't have sex with you. I'm sending Bob down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's something interesting. It was this week in 1814 British troops set fire to the White House. Did you know that? Yeah. The White House was saved&quot; thanks &quot;to the actions of one brave young soldier, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current issue of 'Newsweek' magazine has a picture of President Bush on the cover with the headline, 'What Bush Got Right.' ... 'Newsweek' says that...is their shortest cover story since January's issue on famous Korean rabbis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Olympics are over.&quot; The &quot;great thing about the Olympics&quot; is you have people that &quot;are otherwise enemies...pretending to get along for a couple of days. Oh, I'm sorry, that was the Democratic convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, earlier this evening, Hillary Clinton spoke at the Democratic convention. It's pretty amazing. She gave her entire speech while biting her tongue. Do you know how hard that is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see Michelle Obama's speech last night? Terrific, wonderful speech. You know, it was all the stuff she wanted to say on 'The View' if she could have gotten a word in edgewise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, while Michelle Obama gave her speech, Barack Obama watched the whole thing from a family's living room in Missouri. ... I mean, I know it's tough getting a hotel room in Denver right now, but come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Barack Obama has chosen Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden to be his vice presidential running mate.&quot; Biden &quot;has 35 years experience in Washington,&quot; so &quot;between the two of them, that's almost 36 years of experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At The Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Check it out ? Bill Clinton and John Edwards are hitting on the same woman.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'I think the Chinese delegates are underage.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'No, Mr. President, you belong at the Republican convention.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Shut up! I'm trying to listen to Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No number 4 ? writer at screening of 'House Bunny.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Yes, at midnight they're going to tase Andy Dick.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Hey, it's a giant Al Gore balloon! Oh, wait. That's Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so nice today in New York City that John McCain is buying a house here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, they asked John McCain...'how many houses do you own?' And he says, 'I'll have to get back to you.' And I was thinking about this. I have two houses. Well, actually three, if you count the champagne room at Flashdancers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know the line-up of speakers,&quot; at the Democratic convention, but today, &quot;they had Dennis Kucinich,&quot; Sen. Bob Casey, and a &quot;keynote speech from former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner. Wow! Break out the Budweiser!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course today Hillary Clinton spoke at the Democratic National Convention. And Bill Clinton was there, cheering &quot;and applauding. So was his date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Hillary Clinton gave a big speech at the Democratic convention in support of Barack Obama. ... Experts say it was the longest speech ever delivered entirely through clenched teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, last night, Michelle Obama&quot; gave &quot;a very nice speech&quot; at the convention. She &quot;said she's been in love with Barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;John McCain's wife Cindy said she's been in love with McCain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Democratic convention, Trojan condoms has set up a pavilion where they are handing out thousands of free condoms. ... Yeah, apparently, they are doing this in case John Edwards shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic National Convention is underway in Denver, Colorado. Thousands of pounds of confetti and Styrofoam hats and hookers have been shipped in from all over the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And since this is first DNC to feature an African-American nominee, some are calling it the Run-DNC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Sen. Hillary Clinton&quot; gave a &quot;highly anticipated&quot; convention speech. People &quot;were curious to find out how she would endorse her former foe,&quot; and she &quot;endorsed him pretty strongly,&quot; saying &quot;whatever you're feeling about the primaries, now is the time for the Democrats to put aside...differences [and] come together to rally behind Mr. Potato Ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beijing Olympic coverage wrapped up on Sunday night.&quot; In China, the Olympics were &quot;the most popular thing on Chinese TV, way ahead even of their second place program, 'Kids Manufacture the Darnedest Things.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, coming to work today, I see this guy selling maps to the stars' homes. Right next to him, a guy selling maps to John McCain's homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there's now talk John McCain may choose a woman as his running mate. So, there's hope for Hillary yet!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought Hillary Clinton gave a great speech last night&quot; at the Democratic National Convention, but &quot;about that tangerine-colored pantsuit she was wearing. Maybe I'm wrong, but didn't Elton John wear that at the Grammys last year?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Hillary Clinton released her delegates,&quot; so Barack Obama is &quot;now officially&quot; the &quot;Democratic nominee for president. ... How many thought Hillary should have kept her delegates and released Bill?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama chose Joe Biden&quot; as &quot;his running mate,&quot; and a &quot;lot of people are saying in the media that Biden was the logical choice. ... Biden got, what, 8,000 votes during the primaries? Hillary got 18 million votes. Well, that's logical, sure!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, Ralph Nader, with his 20 votes, turned him down?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton spoke to the&quot; Democratic National Convention &quot;earlier tonight. It was Wednesday. I guess the organizers figured, well, that's fitting. I mean, Wednesday is hump day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama will give his big speech tomorrow night at Invesco Field, a football stadium, which is appropriate, considering how many times the Democrats have fumbled the past couple of years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, the Democratic convention is being held this week at the Pepsi Center in Denver. ... Don't confuse that with John McCain's convention next week. That's at the PoliGrip Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little political fact. Dick Cheney is the first Vice President in 80 years not to run for president. Actually, Cheney did consider four more years, but his doctor only gave him 2 1/2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush declared some counties&quot; hit by Tropical Storm Fay &quot;disaster areas, so they could get federal assistance. Once again, see, I think Bush means well,&quot; but &quot;I don't think he really understands. Like, today, he said it's important to help&quot; Florida, because &quot;he considers it 'one of our most important allies for when we fight the Georgians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Democratic National Convention Pickup Lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Wanna form a more perfect union?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Something's rising and it's not the national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. I'm stiffer than John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Let's go someplace and release our delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Care to join the wife and me for a little 'bipartisanship?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. I'll make you scream like Howard Dean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Now that's what I call a stimulus package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I'm gonna Barack your world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Wanna pretend we're Republicans and have gay bathroom sex?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hi, I'm John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody been watching the Democratic National Convention?&quot; It is &quot;fun to watch.&quot; As &quot;a matter of fact, here is the list of the speakers for tonight. You're going to have Sen. Harry Reid, former New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, and Charles Schumer, senator from New York. I'm telling you, fire up the TiVo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if the&quot; presidential &quot;election were held tomorrow, who would vote for Barack Obama,&quot; and who would &quot;vote for John McCain? They are, as you probably know, ideologically speaking, they are two completely different nominees. For example, one offers you hope,&quot; the &quot;other offers you a dish of hard candy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Hillary Clinton last night at the Democratic convention in Denver? Wasn't that amazing? She...wore a bright-orange pantsuit. Looked like a Caltrans worker or the Hollywood Freeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Hillary...gave a rousing speech. It was so passionate&quot; and &quot;emotional. I'm telling you, Nancy Pelosi's face almost moved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then earlier tonight, her husband, Bill Clinton, spoke at the convention, and what a great speech. ... He got four standing ovations, and five phone numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the Democratic convention...delegates are being warned, this year, not to drink too much. ... Yeah, when asked why, Democratic officials said, 'Last time we got drunk at our convention, we ended up nominating Walter Mondale.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster came out with a children's book about Barack Obama. ... Yeah, they also came out with a children's book about John McCain called 'Horton Gets a Hearing Aid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in Illinois has discovered that her Jeep Cherokee used to be owned by Barack Obama.&quot; You &quot;can tell the jeep is Obama's, because Hillary Clinton keeps trying to get in the driver's seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study has found that Canada is one of the top suppliers of the drug, ecstasy, in the entire world. ... Yeah, police became suspicious when they noticed people excited to be in Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's...running mate...spoke tonight&quot; at the Democratic National Convention. And &quot;after all the name-related problems this campaign has had, why Obama would pick a vice president with the last name Biden is beyond me. ... Obama, Biden ? it's like they're trying to make the ticket sound as much like Osama bin Laden as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inside word is that Obama went back and forth between Biden and Tim Kaine, and ultimately, it came down to a game of Barack, paper, scissors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big star tonight&quot; at the convention &quot;was former President Clinton. He spent most of his time, actually, in the speech talking about how excited he is that Kim Kardashian is going to be on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite a historic day. Barack Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Barack gave his speech on the historic anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. And just two days after Hillary Clinton gave her 'I Had a Dream' speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that Mount Olympus-style backdrop they had for Barack's speech, with the big columns on it? Little over the top, do you think, huh? Like, when they introduced him as 'Barack, son of Zeus,' that seemed over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night during his speech, Bill Clinton promised to do everything he could to help Barack Obama win the election. And then Hillary said, 'That's nice. But you know Bill. Keeping promises is not his strong suit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point this week, police in Denver had a showdown with over 300 protestors, ended up pepper spraying them. And since, of course, it was Denver and they were Democrats, it was only fresh ground pepper spray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Post,' delegates at the Democratic convention received information packets with three separate warnings not to drink too much, because they say alcohol has a much stronger effect in higher altitudes. I guess they didn't want anyone getting drunk and accidentally sleeping with John Edwards again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards was not at the convention, actually. But, like his marriage, he was there in spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain has apparently chosen his vice president. He was going to announce who it was, but then he forgot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was a rumor that McCain might pick former eBay CEO Meg Whitman as his running mate. That makes sense. You know, she's an expert at selling Americans really old stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And archaeologists are now saying that based on the latest findings, Neanderthals...are a lot smarter than they previously gave them credit for. Today, President Bush asked these same researchers to analyze his Presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In Barack Obama's Democratic National Convention Address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Delivered speech in a bright orange pantsuit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Wants to change October to 'Barack-tober.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Most of speech was devoted to his Labor Day barbecue cole slaw recipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Outlined plan for America, then took calls about the Broncos defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Kept saying to John Kerry, 'Hey, why the long face?' ? it's funny every time!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Twelve-and-a-half minutes of, 'Testing-one-two.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Performed hilarious ventriloquist act with Dennis Kucinich on his lap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Promised to make Pluto a state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plans to bring peace to Lo and Audrina on 'The Hills.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Also pronounces 'nuclear,' 'nucular.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Barack Obama was officially nominated Democratic candidate for President of the United States. ... And I want to tell you something. I really think things are starting to look bad for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton spoke at the convention last night.&quot; And it &quot;was sort of sad&quot; when &quot;in the middle of Clinton's speech,&quot; John McCain wandered &quot;out on stage...in his bathrobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sad. I do like that John McCain though. John McCain looks like the kind of guy who turns his business over to his son but still shows up at work once a week. 'Hey, Randy, let me, uh ? Randy, can I see the invoices? Randy?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh! This is exciting. John McCain now has finally decided on his vice president. Yeah. The only question now is from which house will he make the announcement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but this Democratic convention, they're trying to be environmentally friendly.&quot; Even &quot;the confetti...that they drop, that's actually shredded Clinton subpoenas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry...said, 'Well this time, we're going to win.' Hey, that's good enough for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then tonight,&quot; Barack Obama &quot;speaks to the convention, and they moved it to the stadium there in Denver. They're getting, like, 75,000 people. And I'm telling you, the construction crew has been working around the clock, painting the stadium, scrubbing the stadium, plastering. It's the same team that works on Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this was cute. Barack Obama's daughters had a sleepover in the hotel. They had 15 girlfriends sleeping in their hotel room. Coincidentally, so did Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say that John McCain is going to try to steal attention away from the Democrats tonight by leaking the name of his running mate. ... Experts say...there's a pretty good chance that McCain will leak something else, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night...at the Democratic convention, Bill and Hillary Clinton were in&quot; an &quot;elevator...when it got stuck between floors for five minutes. ... A spokesman called it 'a minor technical glitch,' while Bill called it 'my own personal hell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says he's planning to get his daughters a dog if he's elected president.&quot; Most &quot;voters asked think he should get a poodle,&quot; proving &quot;that Americans are not only ready for a black president, they're also ready for a gay first dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow -- this is a little fun fact for you -- both John McCain and Michael Jackson will celebrate their birthday. ... Yeah, so it will be the birthday of an old white guy and John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore...spoke tonight&quot; at the Democratic National Convention. It &quot;was good to see Al Gore. With all the talk about global warming and all he does for the environment, I had forgotten how boring he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many conservatives were critical of the stage&quot; the Democrats &quot;set up at Mile High Stadium. Specifically, some felt these Roman columns made Obama look like he was the high priest at a temple. ... Personally, I think the Republicans are just jealous, because they're used to having a monopoly on things that are stiff and white.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of big stars were&quot; at Obama's acceptance speech, &quot;Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf -- I'm sorry. That was Al Gore. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;84,000 people packed that stadium. And they were going nuts. In fact, I understand the city is now thinking of renaming their team the Denver Bronco-Bamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said last night in his speech, he's gonna fix Washington. Fix Washington? I think Democrats would be happy if he just fixed John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he really went after McCain. Whoo! He did not hold back. It was something. If it was any worse, he could have been charged with elder abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, McCain had already gone to bed hours before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the selection of Sarah Palin: &quot;Actually, it was kind of a smart choice. See, McCain went with a woman, because he didn't want to be in a position to have to get CPR from Mitt Romney. Nobody wants that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Palin and McCain are a good pair. She's pro-life and he's clinging to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, president Bush called Governor Palin to congratulate her. And Bush told Palin the job of Vice President was very important. Because, as Vice President, you get to tell the President what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week a reporter says to John McCain how many homes do you own. Seems like a straightforward enough question. And John McCain says, I'm going to have to get back to you on that. Like there is a deal hanging in the balance? It could be eight, could be nine. We Don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so we looked into this. And we did some research and we found out John McCain lives out there in Arizona. He has a number of ranches. I didn't realize this. He owns a number of ranches. For example the Casa Angina is one of his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lazy colon, have you ever been there? It's beautiful. The AARP, that is a beautiful spread. At Rancho Mylanta. The fort Maalox. Or the Casa Sciatica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I understand, President Bush&quot; is &quot;very upset&quot; that &quot;John McCain has picked Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential running mate.&quot; Bush &quot;said, 'Alaska? Why couldn't he have picked someone from America?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Governor Palin. Apparently, her daughter's name is Juno, as you may know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Governor Palin announced, over the weekend, that her 17-year-old, unmarried daughter is five months pregnant. Oh, boy! You thought John Edwards was in trouble before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a lot of controversy about this. Apparently,&quot; Governor Palin &quot;told McCain about&quot; the pregnancy &quot;weeks ago, but...I guess she said it into his bad ear, so he didn't realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But despite&quot; the pregnancy, Republicans think Palin is &quot;a pretty good running mate for McCain,&quot; because &quot;they feel she can bring in...female voters.&quot; She also &quot;has a good conservative voting record, and she doesn't mind eating dinner at 4:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Sarah Palin standing next to McCain at the podium the other day, when he introduced her? Didn't it look like one of those commercials where the daughter is trying to find a nice home to put Dad in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Governor Palin is a life-long member of the NRA and a long-time hunter. ...Another vice president who's a hunter. What could go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin &quot;also admitted she has smoked marijuana, but she did not enjoy it. Isn't that amazing? Something like 100 million Americans smoke marijuana,&quot; but the &quot;only ones that don't seem to enjoy it are the ones running for office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well...in 1984, Sarah Palin came in second in the Miss Alaska Beauty Pageant. Now she could be vice president of the United States.&quot; So for &quot;the first time in history, a beauty pageant contestant might actually bring about world peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, The Beach Boys kicked off the Republican convention last night in Minnesota. Only the Republicans would have someone singing about big waves and surfing during a hurricane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What? Were Katrina &amp; The Waves not available over the week?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was...talk about canceling the Republican convention because of Hurricane Gustav.&quot; In fact, John McCain helped &quot;out during the hurricane. To give you an idea what a compassionate guy McCain is, he moved over 200,000 evacuees into some of his empty houses. I thought that was great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is, Gustav has been downgraded to a tropical storm. Again, I don't think President Bush really understands this stuff, you know? Like when he heard the levees were fine, he said, 'Thank God, but how are the Goldbergs?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's now being reported that in exchange for Hillary's support, if he is elected, Barack Obama will make Hillary Clinton a Supreme Court judge. Has he thought this through? You know the Clintons. If she gets on the Supreme Court, she could demand a recount and declare herself a winner. It's happened before!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm&quot; is &quot;trying to schedule a hearing to remove Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick from office. But Kilpatrick is fighting this.&quot; So this &quot;will mark the first time in history anyone has ever fought to stay in Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Edwards, who is scheduled in October to speak at the university of Illinois has raised his speaking fee from $55,000 to $65,000! Well then again, he has another mouth to feed,&quot; and &quot;another mouth he has to keep quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things You Don't Want To Hear On Your First Day Of School. &quot;10. 'Please rise as we pledge allegiance to North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Il.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things You Don't Want To Hear On Your First Day Of School. &quot;2. 'I taught George W. Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the Republican convention?&quot; Here is &quot;the roster of speakers tonight. George W. Bush,&quot; Joe Lieberman, and &quot;Fred Thompson. ... Cut me a slice of that! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The convention kicked off with a big mixer for Republican delegates in Senator Larry Craig's airport restroom stall.&quot; It was &quot;easy to spot&quot; because it had &quot;balloons hanging over it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the big news&quot; is that &quot;John McCain has selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate. Apparently, he was turned down by his first choice, Bonnie Hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain felt that what this nation really needs now is a vice president who looks like Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're learning more and more about Sarah Palin. Boy, are we! And listen to this. It turns out that she and her entire family once had a chair-throwing brawl on Jerry Springer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you've got to love this. Sarah Palin is an avid hunter. ... A vice president who likes guns. Well, what could go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, here's good news, ladies and gentlemen. The Palin family crisis that we were talking about on Sunday and Monday, that has been solved now. And today, the baby is being adopted by Angelina Jolie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention is underway,&quot; but &quot;I'm watching the TV news and there is more coverage on Hurricane Gustav. ... Now, a hurricane and the Republican convention are very different, of course. One's a stormy blast of wind that throws mud everywhere. The other's a hurricane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain picked Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. ... She's a popular governor, a great public speaker, and she's raising five kids. So she can definitely change a diaper, which is a skill she's going need if she is running with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think McCain chose...Palin to appeal to women who supported Hillary Clinton. But I'm thinking this is crazy. You can't just replace Hillary Clinton with another woman and think it'll be ok. Bill Clinton tried. It didn't go well.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican convention&quot; has a theme for &quot;each night.&quot; And &quot;the theme&quot; for tonight &quot;is 'Who is John McCain?' ... Tomorrow night's theme is, 'Who forgot to check if the Vice President's daughter is pregnant?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true. John McCain's running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has revealed that her 17-year-old daughter is pregnant. Yeah. Palin said, 'We should never have introduced her to John Edwards.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush appeared at the Republican convention, live via satellite. Yeah. Or as Bush calls it, 'live via magic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year, there are only 36 black delegates at the Republican convention in Minnesota. Yeah. Yeah, as a result, there are now 37 black people in Minnesota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we've got a big deal going on tonight. Judas Priest is here with us. ... They're on their way to the Republican National Convention, and they decided to stop by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Cheney and President Bush cancelled their appearances at the convention because&quot; of Hurricane Gustav &quot;and the fact that no one wanted them to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the gossip this week is centered around Sarah Palin,&quot; John McCain's &quot;controversial choice for vice president. Some question whether a mother of five who's only been running the state of Alaska for only two years is the right person to fill out a ticket fronted by a 175-year-old man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And &quot;Palin's 17-year-old daughter is five months pregnant.&quot; McCain &quot;claims he knew that when he picked&quot; Palin, but the &quot;whole thing...just seems too much like an episode of 'The Maury Povich Show' to have been planned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when the Republicans compared Barack Obama to Britney Spears? Now they've got their own&quot; Jamie Lynn Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how are you going to be the vice president of the United States with five kids to take care of?&quot; Now Palin is going to be &quot;a grandmother and she's partnered with John McCain. How many diapers can one woman possibly change?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well...Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Hanna have been downgraded to tropical storms. That's certainly good news. Well, this downgrading is quite common. The same thing happened last month to Hurricane Hillary. Remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they said that almost all the thousand or so oil rigs in the Gulf had to be abandoned before the storm. And then Dick Cheney said, 'No, those are my children! No!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the good news. The price of oil appears to be dropping. Energy analysts say a $100 barrel of oil is on the horizon,&quot; to &quot;which President Bush said, 'That' where we should be drilling for oil. On the horizon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I saw trader Joe's new commercial last night. But enough about Joe Lieberman at the Republican convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you've got to admit, it was kind of amazing, Joe Lieberman who ran as a Democrat in 2000 with Al Gore,&quot; spoke &quot;last night at the Republican convention. ... That's like Bill Clinton speaking at a sexual abstinence rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain arrived in Minnesota today. The last time McCain stopped in that state he was shooting buffalo from a train. So, it's been a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I don't want to say the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from President Bush,&quot; but did &quot;you notice when Bush was speaking by satellite, they kept trying to change the channel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Sarah Palin gave her speech tonight at the GOP convention. And it gave people who didn't know anything about her a chance to finally meet her. You know, like John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to admit, she looked very comfortable at the podium, because it's kind of like Alaska. When you look out over the convention floor, nothing but white as far as the eye can see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you noticed this, but at the GOP convention, the camera men were desperately trying to find minorities in the audience they could zoom in on. ... Finally after an hour, they found one. It was a Presbyterian standing in a group of Methodists. That was the only one they could find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're learning...more and more about John McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin,&quot; who is &quot;a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association and a firm believer in shotgun weddings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news, John McCain raised $47 million in the month of August. The bad news, he can't remember where he put it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who had birthdays over the weekend? John McCain and Michael Jackson both had birthdays. ... See, that's who McCain should have picked as vice president, Michael Jackson. I mean, think about it. He's black, he's white, he's a man, he's a woman. Could have appealed to everybody!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching the Republican convention on the TV? ... I want to tell you something -- and I made a mistake about this -- the Republicans actually have a lot of ethnic diversity. They do. For example...uh. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Uh...Joe Lieberman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain lasted five and a half years in a POW camp in North Vietnam. Even he couldn't get through Joe Lieberman's speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if you're wondering about this, Dick Cheney did not attend the Republican convention in Minnesota. No, he did not. Yup. Apparently, he had already scheduled a heart attack, so...he won't be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it just me, or does Sarah Palin look like a model for LensCrafters?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Sarah Palin,&quot; the &quot;vice presidential running mate on the Republican ticket,&quot; likes &quot;to shoot assault rifles. I'll say this for her daughter's boyfriend. The kid's got guts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier tonight,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;gave a tremendous speech to the Republicans, though some are claiming it was actually her daughter's speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Delegates were captivated by Palin's speech.&quot; At &quot;one point while she was speaking, the room got so quiet, you could hear Larry Craig's toilet flush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say what you will about this Sarah Palin, women love this candidate. ... As a matter of fact, last night at the convention, security had to restrain Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. It was crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has many views. She says she's opposed to same-sex marriage. ... Yeah, Palin says everyone knows marriage isn't for gay people, it's for pregnant teenagers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of Sarah Palin, she says she's a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association,&quot; which &quot;may explain why she's in favor of shotgun weddings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John McCain was endorsed by the gay group known as the Log Cabin Republicans. ... Yeah, they endorsed McCain, not because he supports gay rights, but because he was actually born in a log cabin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush addressed the crowd at the Republican convention via satellite. ... Yeah, the first ten minutes of Bush's speech consisted of him saying, 'Wait a minute, how you can see me when I can't see you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the Republican National Convention is still going wild...right now.&quot; Palin &quot;was the star speaker tonight. A lot of excitement. She promised a walrus in every igloo and a whale tooth in every papoose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously they're keeping the less popular Republicans out of the spotlight&quot; at the convention. President Bush &quot;gave a speech last night which couldn't have been more than five minutes long. Dick Cheney is in Azerbaijan, which I think is the farthest possible point from Minneapolis on the globe. And they actually locked Idaho Senator Larry Craig in the convention center men's room. Either that or he locked himself in. I'm not sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a week this has been. If you watched last night, I guess you know, Barack Obama got beat up by a girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her &quot;speech last night,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;mocked Obama...for giving speeches in front of adoring crowds and standing in front of a stage backdrop. Ironically, Palin&quot; did so &quot;in front of an adoring crowd standing in front of a stage backdrop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Palin &quot;had everybody mesmerized.&quot; Even Senator Larry Craig &quot;said he was glued to his toilet seat.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...Bill Clinton said&quot; that &quot;when 'Hillary attacks Obama it's wrong, but when Sarah does it, it's somehow hot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they said that Governor Palin was coached by some of John McCain's senior advisers. Senior advisers? The guy is 72. How old are these guys? ... Are they left over from the Bull Moose Party?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say&quot; Palin's speech &quot;was written by George Bush's speechwriter,&quot; which &quot;was great for&quot; that guy because he &quot;finally got a chance to use some big words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Palin &quot;made some interesting points last night. She said when she was Governor of Alaska she got rid of the state's luxury jet and put it on eBay. ... Ironically, do you know who bought it? John and Cindy McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin &quot;said last night that John McCain had seen evil,&quot; but &quot;I didn't even know Dick Cheney was at the convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see McCain and Palin standing together? Didn't it look like a special episode of 'Regis and Kelly?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Senator McCain already showing tremendous faith in Palin as his vice presidential nominee. Like, did you notice after the speech last night, he came on stage, finally signed that do-not-resuscitate order.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the Republicans are heaping praise on Governor Palin. Fred Thompson said, as an actor, he could see them making a movie about Sarah Palin and her family. Didn't they already make that movie? I think it was called 'Knocked Up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said at her church, Governor Palin, said she asked everyone to pray for a natural gas pipeline, which she said was God's will. And today, God said, 'Hey lady, I don't deal with oil companies. That's more Satan's area.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess there are some problems&quot; with Palin, though. Have &quot;you heard about this 'Troopergate' scandal?&quot; Palin &quot;allegedly...used her power as governor to pressure officials to fire her former brother-in-law from his state trooper job. Now, maybe I'm wrong, but wasn't that an episode of 'Dukes of Hazzard?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and all those&quot; Internet photos &quot;of Sarah Palin in a bikini holding a gun.&quot; But they are &quot;all photoshopped. Like those photos of Bill and Hillary dancing, all fake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin also said that when she was governor,&quot; it &quot;was not uncommon for her to bring her children to work with her.&quot; But it is &quot;not going to work out bringing kids to the White House. McCain yelling out the window, 'Get off the lawn!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the&quot; convention &quot;speakers praised George Bush Sr. for passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, allowing people with disabilities to get hired. Thus, of course, paving the way for his own son to one day become President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers in Tokyo report that elephants are able to do math. ... They report that given basic math tests,&quot; Asian elephants &quot;got it right 87% of the time. You know, it's bad enough our students can't compete with the Asian students, now we can't even compete with the Asian elephants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw...Sarah Palin&quot; last night? She &quot;looks like the weekend anchor on Channel 9.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin &quot;looks like the hygienist who makes you feel guilty about not flossing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin &quot;looks like the relieved mom in a Tide commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is from Alaska, where there are &quot;rugged, individualist people.&quot; In fact, Palin herself &quot;has some wild ideas. ... She wants to change the US currency from dollars...to pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of biographical information about Sarah Palin last night. When she was 24 years old, she eloped with her boyfriend. Yeah. And I believe the last governor to elope with a boyfriend was, well, Jim McGreevey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, after the Sarah Palin speech, John McCain comes on stage. And you thought, whoa, something dramatic will happen.&quot; But &quot;it turns out he was just looking for his glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then earlier tonight, John McCain had his big acceptance speech,&quot; but &quot;I didn't watch&quot; and &quot;I'll tell you why. If I want to see an old guy...struggle with a teleprompter,&quot; then &quot;I'll watch Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's husband was at the convention last night. And at one point, Palin said her husband's parents were Eskimos. ... Then tonight, during John McCain's speech, he admitted that his parents were Vikings.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, today it was reported that the speech that Sarah Palin delivered at the convention was actually written by President Bush's speech writer,&quot; which &quot;explains the title of the speech, 'I Like Trucks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While she was addressing the crowd, Sarah Palin spent a lot of time criticizing Barack Obama's campaign speeches for not having enough specifics. ... Obama was reportedly angry about the claim, but didn't say exactly why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Mayor of Detroit agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice charges. ... Yeah, as punishment, he will be required to serve out his full term as Mayor of Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the final...night of the Republican National Convention.&quot; And there &quot;when was a lot of applause when they introduced&quot; John McCain, &quot;which actually confused him because he thought they were trying to turn the lights off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the big themes for many of the convention speakers was that they say we need to elect a Republican to go in and clean up the mess in Washington. I think that's actually a great lesson for kids. Always clean up your own mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see John McCain last night? He gave a great speech. And you've got to admit, he looked so life-like, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; McCain &quot;came out swinging. I haven't seen him this fired up since they came up with a new Super PoliGrip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, several times, McCain talked about serving his country in Vietnam, which is a nice change after 16 years and two presidents who could never quite explain how they got out of serving their country in Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, John McCain said that under the Democratic healthcare plan, a bureaucrat would stand between you and your doctor, as opposed to the Republican healthcare plan, where an accountant would stand between you and your healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; some &quot;Republicans are not that thrilled with the speech. In fact, the rumor is Sarah Palin is thinking of dropping him from the ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to admit,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;really has energized the Republican base. See, Sarah Palin can do what John McCain can't do -- send an e-mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Bill Clinton was impressed. In fact, Clinton said...when he saw the speech, he said, 'Finally, a woman who could be president I'd actually want to have sex with.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when Governor Palin was giving her speech the other night,&quot; the &quot;teleprompter broke and she had to keep going from memory.&quot; That &quot;happened to Joe Biden once,&quot; but &quot;with him, he talked so long, the teleprompter&quot; shot &quot;itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rudy Giuliani, he gave a good speech the other night as well. He called Obama's experience into question. He said Barack Obama needs to be more seasoned. You know, go through a couple more marriages, get the feel of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a little known fact from the Republican convention. This is kind of interesting. You know the confetti they dropped at the end?&quot; That &quot;was made from the actual Constitution of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the ratings are in,&quot; and it &quot;seems 40 million people watched Sarah Palin's speech, and 40 million people watched Barack Obama's speech. ... So, the message is pretty clear. Barack Obama needs to run with Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the commentators agreed that no, matter who wins the election, history's going to be made with either the first African-American president or the first female vice president, to which Hillary Clinton said, 'Yeah, you could have had both!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said he was not bothered by Sarah Palin's scathing comments about him. He said he's been called worse things on the basketball court, although nothing compared to what they called him at the bowling alley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, thinking hard may cause people to&quot; eat &quot;more. Do you know what that means? We are a nation of geniuses!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But John McCain and his VP Sarah Palin, bonding, getting together, really enjoying one another. As a matter of fact, today, she took him to the mall for new Rockports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Sarah Palin is the Governor of Alaska, you know that. And she's a lifelong member&quot; of the &quot;National Rifle Association. So great, is what I'm thinking, another vice president that shoots a drinking buddy; just get ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain turned...72 years old last Friday,&quot; but the &quot;Chinese are making him a birth certificate that says he's only 33 and then he'll be ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not getting tapped as vice president was disappointing for...Mitt Romney,&quot; but &quot;don't worry about Mitt. He's going to continue doing just fine. He will be playing Palmer Courtland on 'All My Children.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody talking about John McCain's big speech last night at the Republican convention.&quot; McCain &quot;used the word 'change' over ten times during his acceptance speech,&quot; although, &quot;nine of those times it was in the sentence, 'Could somebody please change me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is out on the campaign trail. Today, she attended a rally in Wisconsin. ... The Alaska Governor said she was thrilled to visit Wisconsin. because she's never been to the Deep South.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey's in the middle of a big scandal, because she is refusing to have Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on her show. ... The friction started because Palin said if she's elected, she'll be the most powerful woman in the country. And Oprah said, 'The hell you will!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During John McCain's speech last night, an anti-Republican heckler began yelling at him. Yeah. Officials removed the man and immediately gave him a job at MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards&quot; announced &quot;that in order not to be a distraction, he's canceling all public appearances until the election is over. Yeah. However, Edwards said he will continue to make all of his private appearances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Amy Winehouse is going to be appearing at a music festival, and she's demanding -- this is true -- that her dressing room be stocked with 50 bottles of Jack Daniels. Yeah. Yeah, so the good news is she's cutting back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cindy McCain appeared&quot; at the Republican National Convention, and &quot;'Vanity Fair' took a look&quot; at an outfit she wore. The magazine &quot;priced it out at around $300,000.&quot; With &quot;that kind of money, you could buy an 11th house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should we be nervous about a man who preaches against wasteful spending when his wife is wearing $300,000?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a story going around that said Oprah doesn't want to have Sarah Palin on her show.&quot; Oprah &quot;claims there have been absolutely no discussions about having Palin on, but that she would love to after the campaign is over. Apparently, between 'Nate Berkus' Bathroom Makeovers' and 'The Best Jeans for Curvy Women', they're...all booked up. They don't have a slot open. It has nothing to do with Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is spending, what, $200 billion to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unemployment, five-year high. Foreclosures are at a 19-year high.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something that surprised a lot of people.&quot; It &quot;looks like John McCain's speech last week beat Barack Obama's speech in the ratings. ... That's like 'American Idol' being beaten by a rerun of 'Matlock.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say that John McCain's biggest challenge is to convince people that he's not George W. Bush. Hey, just the fact he went to Vietnam shows he's not George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Governor Sarah Palin on the cover of 'Newsweek?'&quot; She is shown &quot;holding a shotgun.&quot; The &quot;picture was taken right after she announced that guy would be marrying her pregnant daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people now are criticizing Gov. Palin for her lack of foreign policy experience. They say she won't be able to deal with other countries. But is that a big deal? I mean, hey, how many foreign countries even talk to us anymore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They asked&quot; Palin &quot;if she would be able to explain how she once lobbied Washington for earmarks, and she said, 'We'll cross that bridge to nowhere when we come to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It &quot;got a little testy on the campaign trail today. A reporter asked John McCain if he ever Googled Sarah Palin, and McCain said, 'Hey, you take your filthy mouth, and get out of here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in international news, 60% of the people in the country of Jordan say they find Americans to be rude. Actually, that's not so bad when you consider 60% of people in other Middle Eastern countries think we're Satan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Talking To A Fake Kim Jong-Il.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Doesn't smile when you mention torturing dissidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. He's 6'5&quot;, 250 pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Introduces himself by saying, 'Hi, I'm Gary -- uh, crap, I mean Kim Jong-Il.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. He seems Kimmy and Jongy, but not quite Illy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Your wife recognizes him as the Kim Jong-Il look-alike who stripped at her bachelorette party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Keeps using the phrase, 'Chillax, bro.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. He pays for drinks -- honestly, folks, when's the last time that man picked up a check?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Won't shut up about the new '90210.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He's only half insane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Keeps referring to himself as 'just a hockey mom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in New York City has Fashion Week fever. ... As a matter of fact,&quot; the &quot;Statue of Liberty earlier today was wearing a pair of those hip Sarah Palin glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, everybody's out there campaigning. And today,&quot; in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Sen. John McCain &quot;was there with Sarah Palin. And they were having lunch at a diner,&quot; and &quot;I thought this was so sweet.&quot; She was &quot;cutting his meat for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain was sitting there at the counter,&quot; wearing &quot;his Diamondbacks baseball cap,&quot; muttering &quot;about hippies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is old.&quot; In fact, he &quot;is so old that his blood type has been discontinued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do...kind of like that Sarah Palin.&quot; She &quot;looks like the flight attendant who won't give you a second can of Pepsi. 'No, you've had enough. We're landing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the waitress at the coffee shop who draws a little smiley face on your check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV's &quot;'Video Music Awards' were last night.&quot; The show was &quot;hosted by Russell Brand,&quot; who &quot;referred to President Bush,&quot; and &quot;this caused a big controversy,&quot; as &quot;'a retarded cowboy.' People got upset,&quot; because, of course, &quot;everyone knows the correct term is 'special needs cowboy.' If he'd said that, there wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Barack Obama took his daughters to their first day of school, which was sweet.&quot; And in &quot;a related story, John McCain took his daughters to pick up their Social Security checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say...that since Sarah Palin became the vice presidential nominee, there's been an actual spike in the sales of her style of eyeglasses. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, which came out today, John McCain has started to open up a lead over Barack Obama. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news for John McCain. His poll numbers are up 4%, and liver spots down 3%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney told reporters this week there's no reason why Sarah Palin cannot be a successful vice president in the McCain Administration. In fact, not only can she shoot a lawyer in the face, she can field dress him as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people are saying Governor Palin really put Alaska on the map, to which President Bush said, 'Really? Well how come I still can't find it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know...those glasses&quot; Palin &quot;wears? Those are...a hot item right now. ... Everybody's buying them. They're huge, selling much better than the Joe Biden hair plugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you all know, President Bush was not at the Republican convention due to a disaster -- his Presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out on the campaign trail this week, once again John McCain spoke about the nightmare of being stuck in a...tiny 8 x 10 room thinking he might go crazy. Not in Vietnam -- when he got stuck in the Capitol elevator with Joe Biden,&quot; and Biden &quot;wouldn't shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama &quot;plans to have lunch with Bill Clinton in New York later this week. And that's...got to be a little uncomfortable, don't you think? I mean, you have someone who had a strained relationship with Hillary, having lunch with a Democratic presidential nominee. That could be a little...tricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, listen to this. Boy George has released a new song that is inspired by Barack Obama. ... If that doesn't put Obama over the top with the Joe Six Pack crowd, nothing will, huh?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, this past weekend, the government announced a massive bailout of mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Give you an idea how big this bailout is, they actually had to tell President Bush about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I knew the mortgage industry was in trouble when I went to buy a wedding gift for a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago. I bought a toaster, they gave me a bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, no sign of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il. ... Nobody's seen him. They say if he's not in the public eye for at least six months, you know what happens? You know what that means? He winds up on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm sorry to announce, for the third year in a row, health experts have named Mississippi as the fattest state in the Union. ... In fact, you know what the official bird of Mississippi is? Anybody know? The fried chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone know what the state motto of Mississippi is? 'Hey, are you going to finish that?' That is the state motto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the show tonight doesn't go well, guess what?&quot; The &quot;Federal government is bailing me out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a wet, rainy day right here in New York City&quot; today. And along those lines, John McCain admitted today that &quot;he doesn't know how many umbrellas he owns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. ... He looks like a guy whose cell phone has a big band ring tone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about that Barack Obama?&quot; They are &quot;saying for the first time he's starting to slip in the polls,&quot; but &quot;don't worry. He's got a plan. He's going to go back to campaigning in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Sarah Palin and John McCain? What a ticket. ... Well, they're out on the campaign trail,&quot; and &quot;today, she took him for a haircut. 'A little trim. Come on, Dad, let's just...drop right in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Sarah Palin and John McCain make an appearance together, there's always a brief hug,&quot; but &quot;no kissing. ... It's just like Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that Sarah Palin. She looks like the lady in the dental office who gives you the keys to the restroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like my selection of the week on eHarmony.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the woman in the department store who tries to spray you with perfume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin refuses to come on 'The Late Show,'&quot; or &quot;as she calls it, 'the bridge to nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporters asked&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;if she could ever be president and commander-in-chief,&quot; and she &quot;said, 'Ya, sure, you betcha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Sarah Palin action figure came out today.&quot; And, apparently &quot;they're working on a John McCain action figure. ... The best part, you can change his diaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're&quot; also &quot;coming out with a Barack Obama affirmative action figure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand is performing tonight at a fundraiser for Barack Obama -- $25,000 a seat. But for $50,000, you don't have to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People all over the world now are following our election. And according to a new international poll that just came out,&quot; people &quot;in Canada want Barack Obama to be the next US president.&quot; That &quot;makes sense because Obama has the support of Canada's anti-war voters, as well as Canada's black guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an old picture of Sarah Palin circulating on the Internet right now, and she's wearing a t-shirt that says, 'I may be broke, but I'm not flat busted.' ... John McCain was upset when he heard this and asked, 'What's the Internet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only 56 days until the presidential election, and most of the attention now is centered around John McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin. They're already selling...Sarah Palin action figures online,&quot; and there was a &quot;sad incident at Toys 'R' Us today when the Sarah Palin dolls shot My Little Pony.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know,&quot; the presidential campaign is &quot;coming down to one very important issue -- putting makeup on farm animals. That seems to be where we're at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this is so stupid. Did you hear about this? Yesterday, Barack Obama attacked John McCain's policies, implying it's more of the same by saying, 'You...can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.' ... Well now McCain is demanding an apology. Do you believe...two US Senators arguing over lipstick? And neither one of them is Larry Craig.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Bush now has been drawn into this controversy. But again, you see, I don't think President Bush really understands the issue. Like he said, 'What people do in private is their business, as long as they don't marry the pig.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more good news this week for John McCain. It seems he is now matching Barack Obama's fundraising numbers. But he does have a slight advantage. See, for every dollar McCain raises, Medicare matches it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the 'New York Times,' Barack Obama's campaign is having a hard time meeting their fundraising goals, and they're pressing their donors for more money. ... In fact, Obama said today he's willing to take change. He will now accept change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess...it's getting serious,&quot; because Barack Obama is &quot;going to have lunch with Bill Clinton this week to discuss democratic strategy. ... You know, they haven't been that friendly up to this point. Of course, it's tough agreeing on a restaurant, because the two men are both so different. Finally, they settled on a Hooters that serves arugula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's a very strange political campaign. I mean, out on the campaign trail, John McCain and Sarah Palin are talking about how they stood up to the Republican Party, they fought the Republican establishment, and they battled Republicans. Their message -- vote Republican. I don't quite understand how that works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the 'Wall Street Journal' said today Democrats are sending an army of lawyers and investigators up to Alaska to look into the background of Sarah Palin. And of course, John McCain is furious. He said, 'Hey, if I didn't look into her background, there's no reason you should be looking into her background.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton was on the campaign trail yesterday supporting Barack Obama,&quot; but &quot;she is not attacking Sarah Palin in any way. She said Sarah Palin is a great accomplishment.&quot; She &quot;also said women, as well as men, make their decision aft they weigh the evidence, as opposed to her husband Bill, who makes his decision after he sees how much the evidence weighs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have T. Boone Pickens on the show tonight.&quot; He is a billionaire who &quot;has a plan for getting more energy by creating wind farms. He wants to create wind farms,&quot; to &quot;which President Bush said, 'Well, how do you plant wind?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Touch of autumn in the air, and the leaves are falling. Today, as a matter of fact, John McCain admitted that he doesn't know how many rakes he owns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, did you hear about this? Rumors coming out of North Korea that dictator Kim Jong Il may be...really sick or dead. ... Now, if that's true, North Korea will now be ruled by Kim Jong Il's brother, Mentally Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the program tonight, Senator Barack Obama is here. It's the first time we've had 80,000 people in the Ed Sullivan Theater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as a matter of fact -- I don't know if you're aware of this -- all New Yorkers have Obama fever. ... Everybody's very excited about him being in New York City. New York City cab drivers, by the way, are offering their Barack Obama special ? they'll gladly accept change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, in Virginia today,&quot; Senator John McCain &quot;and Sarah Palin were campaigning. Do you like Sarah Palin? ... I like her because she looks like the lady at the bakery who yells out, '44! 44! 45!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like a real estate agent whose picture you see on the bus stop bench.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the lady who has a chain of cupcake stores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the mayor of a small town that's banned dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People...are now asking the question&quot; is Sarah Palin &quot;ready to be president? ... If, God forbid, something happens to John McCain, is Sarah Palin ready to be president? I don't think we need to worry about that because Bush has lowered the bar so tremendously, I mean, I'm ready to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources in North Korea...say that dictator Kim Jong Il is very sick. He may have to shift power to one of his three sons. ... Of course, there's still an out of the box chance he'll pick Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story today, Barack Obama was accused of insulting Sarah Palin when he criticized Republican policies by saying, 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.' ... Political experts say that if Obama keeps insulting Palin, he could lose the election and win a job at MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians today are all lining up to attack Obama's comment about putting lipstick on a pig. ... President Bush called the remarks 'outrageous.' Dick Cheney called them 'over the line.' Joe Lieberman said they're 'not kosher.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy George says he's written a song supporting Barack Obama. Yeah. Yeah, this will help Barack lock up the critical 1980s gay British pop star vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Washington, DC, independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader met with&quot; former &quot;presidential candidate Ron Paul. Yeah, they didn't plan the meeting. They just bumped into each other in a soup line.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Times' had a big article on problems that elderly people face. And they say one of the worst things that can happen to an old person -- breaking a hip. ... Second worst thing that can happen -- losing Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden&quot; put &quot;his foot in his mouth the other day again. When out on the campaign trail, he told a crowd of people that Hillary Clinton 'might have been a better pick for vice president than me,' to which Hillary said, 'It's not too late!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Biden &quot;told the crowd that Hillary is as qualified or more qualified than he is. Plus, she still has her original hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin has left the campaign trail. Whew! Take a break. What's it been, a week?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She went back to Alaska for a while. So you know that what that means -- people can go back to ignoring John McCain again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I guess earlier today, up there in Alaska, she shot two campaign commercials, a moose, and a caribou.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I tell you though,&quot; John McCain &quot;is thrilled with his running mate! He's energized by this woman. In fact, he told the press today, Sarah Palin makes him feel as young as Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, when reporters asked him what keeps him going, McCain said bran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something they do every election year. ... They always ask voters, 'Which candidate would you rather have a beer with?' You want to have a beer with any politicians, really?&quot; McCain would &quot;order a Budweiser, and then future generations would have to pay for it. Barack Obama would order some fancy European beer we couldn't afford. Sarah Palin would order a Moosehead and a shot.&quot; Clinton, &quot;he's still trying to tap the keg.&quot; So &quot;why would you want to drink with any of these people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, 78% of Washington, DC, eighth graders can't do basic math.&quot; But today, &quot;President Bush said, 'Let's focus on the positive. Let's look at the 48% who can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jack Hanna is on the program this evening, ladies and gentlemen. Jungle Jack ? I'm very excited. Jack is going to put lipstick on a pig. That will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight and tomorrow night, Charles Gibson over there at ABC going to interview Sarah Palin. And I believe it'll be her first big time interview. And Charles Gibson, the first question he asks her, he says, 'Are you ready to be President?' And Sarah Palin said, 'Oh, fer sure!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, no, seriously, the interview went very well, and during the interview, Sarah Palin actually gave birth to her sixth child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like Sarah Palin? Yeah. I...like Sarah Palin. She looks like the dip sample lady at Safeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the nurse who weighs you, then and makes you sit alone in your underwear for 20 minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the Olive Garden hostess who says, 'I'm sorry, your table's not ready yet.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;looks like the infomercial lady who says she made $60,000 a month flipping condos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Matt Damon says he believes that Sarah Palin would be a disaster in the White House. ... Now wait a minute, wait a minute. I think I'll wait to hear what Ben Affleck has to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and tomorrow, talk about tremendous viewing. Tomorrow on 'The View,' John McCain...will be a guest.&quot; But be &quot;careful, John, because that place is like a North Vietnamese prison with Botox. So just watch yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's been spending the last couple of days being briefed by advisers on what she needs to know to be John McCain's vice president. That's true. Yeah. Apparently, the first thing they taught her was CPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you watched TV last night, you know Charlie Gibson did something John McCain has never done -- interviewed Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, last night, Sarah Palin gave a interview with ABC's Charles Gibson. And earlier today, her future son-in-law was on 'Maury Povich.' 'You are the father! 'You are the father!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point, Charlie Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but she didn't know what it was. But, you know, to be fair, even Bush doesn't know what the Bush Doctrine is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supporters of Palin say it's okay she doesn't know what the Bush Doctrine is because the average American doesn't know what it is. But shouldn't the bar be a little higher for this job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, hey, let's be honest. We already had an average guy as president. It didn't work out that great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was also asked if we might have to go to war with Russia, and she said, 'Perhaps so.' ... Isn't that like a Magic 8 Ball kind of answer? 'Will we have to go to war?' 'Reply hazy, try again later.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the Secret Service revealed that Sarah Palin's Secret Service code name is 'Denali.' Now, here's my question. What's the secret part? ... I mean, why don't they just call her Sarah?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...as you know, they've already come out with a Sarah Palin action figure. And today, the Democrats released a Joe Biden action figure. It talks and talks and talks.&quot; You &quot;just can't get the thing to shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the other day while talking to a group of supporters, Joe Biden said that Hillary Clinton might have been a better pick for vice president than him. Well, that's one thing to get the base fired up, huh? Tell them they picked the wrong person! Yeah! That'll get them fired up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charles Rangel, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,&quot; is &quot;the guy that writes the tax codes.&quot; Well, he &quot;has been found to be in default on his taxes on income on a beach villa he owns in the Caribbean. Rangel blames it on his accountant, and he said he didn't understand the law.&quot; He &quot;wrote it! ... If he doesn't understand it, how screwed are we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And rapper Kanye West arrested yesterday&quot; at LAX &quot;after getting in an altercation with paparazzi.&quot; If &quot;you're going to pick one day to act up at the airport, maybe September 11th is not the best day&quot; to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the program. I'm Dave Letterman, a pit bull with lipstick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That John McCain, by gosh, did you know this he was on 'The View' earlier today. Yup. And I thought to myself, well...hasn't this man endured enough torture? Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that John McCain is a great guy. And when he was finished at 'The View,' as a thank you gift, he bought everybody on the show a house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But how about that ticket, John McCain and Sarah Palin? ... Political insiders told me that Sarah Palin's main job...on the ticket now is to tell John McCain when he's got something on his chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how about that Sarah Palin? I like Sarah Palin. She looks like the phone operator...in the commercial who pretends that she's standing by for your call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're learning more and more about Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;was Mayor of a town called Wasilla, Alaska. ... I went to looking at it. There's only one store in Wasilla.&quot; They have a &quot;Bed, Bath and Way Beyond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wasilla, Alaska, is so small, if you pick up&quot; the town's guide book, &quot;called 'Things To Do In Wasilla,&quot; it &quot;reads, 'You're doing it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, ABC News aired the first televised interview with Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;stumbled a bit because she had never heard of the Bush Doctrine. Yeah. When he heard this, President Bush said, 'That's okay. Neither have I.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big event yesterday in New York. Barack Obama had lunch with&quot; former President Bill Clinton. Afterwards, &quot;Clinton said, 'It's the first time the two of us have had a chance to sit down together and really bitch about Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest political commercial by Barack Obama...attempts to portray John McCain as being unfamiliar with technology.&quot; McCain &quot;was outraged, and he responded in an e-mail, or as McCain calls it, 'a computer letter from the future.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...had her first real interview as vice presidential nominee last night.&quot; ABC's Charlie Gibson &quot;asked her some very...tough questions.&quot; John McCain's &quot;were happy with the interview, they said. It went so well, they may even let her do another one, sometime -- maybe in a month or two.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest word from Wall Street. 'Ahhhh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, I guess you heard by now, Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy. How many know what Lehman Brothers is? How many think it's like the Jonas Brothers? Yeah. That's kind of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush understands this crisis either. Like, today, when he heard about Lehman Brothers going bankrupt, he said, 'Where am I going to get discount suits now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching cable all day trying to figure this out. Experts say we're going through what's known as a 'lock, stock, and barrel financial phase.' You know what that is? You know how that works? People are locked out of their homes, their stock is worthless, and the oil companies have us over a barrel. That's how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched that new reality show on ABC with Charlie Gibson Friday night: 'America's Next Top Vice President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Sarah Palin's interview with Charlie Gibson? Did you all watch that? In fact, John McCain was watching it at home and at one point he turned to his wife and said, 'She looks really familiar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Republicans are still keeping&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;away from the mainstream press. In fact, the only reporter she's taking questions from, I guess, 'Field &amp; Stream.' That's the only magazine she's done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Sarah Palin is going from an interview with Gibson on ABC to one with Sean Hannity on Fox. Ooh, that should be hard-hitting, huh? That's like going from 'Hardball' to T-ball, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin said she is ready for Sean Hannity. In fact, she spent all day today writing out the questions he's going to ask her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you saw the big interview with Gibson, Sarah Palin quoted Abraham Lincoln, when Lincoln said, 'Let us not pray that God is on our side in any war or at any other time, but let us pray that we are on God's side.' And here's the amazing part. You know who Abraham Lincoln said that to? John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the Gibson interview, a lot of people thought Charlie Gibson was unfair to&quot; Sarah Palin, &quot;thought he was talking down to her. That was one of the comments. Like, when he asked about the so-called Bush Doctrine. Most people are not familiar with the Bush Doctrine, right? Well, we are,&quot; but &quot;we know it by another name: 'Murphy's Law.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's something I mentioned last week. For some reason, the Secret Service revealed&quot; that &quot;Sarah Palin's Secret Service code name is Denali. ... Turns out, Denali is an old Eskimo word that means Dan Quayle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And despite all the animosity in this campaign, you know, John McCain and Joe Biden are actually old friends from the Senate. ... In fact, they go back so far, when they first met, McCain had hair and Joe Biden didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, August was a big month for the campaigns. Barack Obama set a record for fundraising dollars. Raised $66 million. John McCain raised $47 million. And Ralph Nader got a $10 gift card from Jamba Juice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, Russia had something they called the Day of Conception,&quot; when &quot;Russia tries to encourage Russian couples to have sex and make babies to increase their population. Actually, we have something similar here. We have a day where everyone gets screwed. It's called Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Karl Rove said John McCain's attack ads have gone too far. When Karl Rove says you've gone too far, that's like Mel Gibson saying you've had too much to drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the Sarah Palin interview on ABC?&quot; This &quot;state trooper from Alaska says that Palin lied in the interview. She lied on national television. I'd say someone's ready for the White House!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both presidential candidates reacted to the market turmoil today. Barack Obama laid out a detailed five-part plan,&quot; but &quot;John McCain's plan is much simpler. He's just going to have his wife fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is true. They interviewed Sarah Palin's father. And Sarah Palin's father says that they shoot 90% of the meat their family eats. ... Yeah, the other 10%,&quot; they &quot;hit with their pickup truck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, John McCain appeared on the show 'The View,' and one of the hosts accused McCain of being a liar. ... Yeah, she may have a point, because McCain started the interview by saying, 'Ladies, you look beautiful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican strategist Karl Rove recently gave an interview. And he said John McCain's attack ads go too far and aren't truthful. Yeah. Then Rove said, 'I've never been so proud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Election Day,&quot; Ralph Nader &quot;will appear on the presidential ballot in only 45 states. Yeah. Nader said, 'This is really disappointing. I wanted to embarrass myself in all 50 states.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend in New York City, gays and lesbians staged a protest demanding the right to get married. Yeah. When he heard this, President Bush said, 'Wait a minute, now gays want to marry lesbians?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. You people obviously don't have money in the stock market, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the stock market completely crashed yesterday,&quot; but &quot;market analysts are...calling it a 'correction.'&quot; That is kind &quot;of like saying UCLA had a close game&quot; last weekend when it lost 59-0 to BYU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson tried to calm growing fears, vowing that the US financial markets will remain stable. And he said, 'You can take that to the bank, assuming you can find one that's still open.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush gets it. He doesn't really understand these economic issues. Like today,&quot; when &quot;he was asked if customers should be concerned by all these bank closings,&quot; Bush &quot;said, 'If the bank is closed, you just use the ATM.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America. See, that's when you know the subprime mortgage market is bad, when even brokerage houses are losing their houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why they're called brokers. After they take your money, you're broker. You see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something that just makes people crazy. ... The former CEO of Fannie Mae...is living in a $10 million, 22-room mansion,&quot; and he &quot;will be able to keep it because he gets $9.3 million in severance pay. Here's a good idea. For all those people who lost their houses because of Fannie Mae, they should be allowed to move in with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course the presidential election now down to the choice of Barack Obama and what's his name versus Sarah Palin and what's his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure if Sarah Palin knows what to do about the economy either. Do you think she has any experience? She was asked today what to do in a bear market. And she said, 'Well, you should shoot it, and then skin it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you all know, during the interview with Charles Gibson last week on ABC, Sarah Palin did not know what the Bush Doctrine was. But to be fair, a month ago, she didn't know who John McCain was either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But John McCain's campaign said that Sarah Palin will not talk to the media, this is a quote, 'until reporters can address her with respect and deference.' Oh, what is she running for, vice president or queen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and listen to this. In her blog, Lindsay Lohan, this week, speaking out.&quot; She &quot;has come out against Sarah Palin, although most people are reserving judgment until they hear from Nicole Richie and Jessica Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden gave a speech in Michigan, yesterday, where he said that John McCain is the sequel to President Bush. And he said the sequel is always worse than the original. ... President Bush was furious. He said, 'Apparently, Joe Biden has not seen 'The Empire Strikes Back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain and Barack Obama met last week for a forum on national services at Columbia University in New York. McCain said being on a college campus reminded him of all his old professors like Aristotle and Socrates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John McCain and Sarah Palin attended a campaign rally in Vienna, Ohio, today. ... Apparently, they went to Vienna so Sarah Palin could get some foreign policy experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;is popular. ... You know who's got to be depressed about all this? Hillary Clinton. I mean, look at this woman. She works hard, goes to Wellesley, goes to Yale, graduates with honors; devotes her entire life to public service. Now she's starting to realize if she had just put on makeup and shot a moose, she'd be on her way to the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, Barack Obama was in Hollywood at a...sold-out fundraiser featuring Barbra Streisand singing.&quot; The event, which cost &quot; $28,500,&quot; featured &quot;dinner prepared by the finest Hollywood chefs serving an array of gourmet food. And the topic tonight was how John McCain is out of touch with the common people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, John McCain...attended his own fundraiser tonight, where he raised even more money. He had dinner with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said again today that the 'fundamentals of our economy' are still sound,&quot; to &quot;which O.J. Simpson said, 'Hey, is it too late to get him on the jury?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; had &quot;a small growth removed from his forehead. Doctors say it wasn't a health risk. The growth just didn't want to be photographed with President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was shocking news from the FBI today. Last year, 873,000 people were arrested for marijuana. I know! Here's the shocking part. None of them were Willie Nelson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of John McCain's advisors is saying McCain helped invent the Blackberry. ... I'm like, oh, come on. They should've gone with something more believable, like John McCain helped invent fire&quot; or &quot;the wheel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand threw a big fundraiser for Democrats. First was dinner,&quot; which &quot;cost 28 grand a plate,&quot; then &quot;a Streisand concert. For an extra grand, you could leave before she started singing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundraiser&quot; brought in &quot;a lot of money.&quot; Barack Obama &quot;must be very happy, because nothing says, 'I'm a man of the people,' like a star-studded dinner in the Beverly Hills Hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans tried to put on a similar event,&quot; but John McCain &quot;kept asking for the wrong celebrities. He was like, 'Oh, get me the Benny Goodman Orchestra. What about Charlie Chaplain? He's hilarious!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you really think it's a good idea have a $9 million fundraiser in Beverly Hills the day after the country's financial system crashes. I don't know if that is good judgment. That's like...having Mel Gibson come to your bar mitzvah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An adviser to John McCain...claimed today, just a couple of hours ago, that McCain helped create the Blackberry,&quot; or, &quot;as McCain calls it, 'the fancy garage door opener.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Barack Obama's campaign just announced that Barbra Streisand will headline an upcoming fundraiser for Obama.&quot; After &quot;hearing this, John McCain said, 'And he says I'm out of touch with the American people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A religious leader in Saudi Arabia has denounced Mickey Mouse as a tool of Satan. ... Yeah, the weird thing is he has nothing but good things to say about Goofy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow fell 504 points yesterday. ... On Wall Street, they're calling it 'Black Monday,'&quot; and &quot;John McCain was quick to point out today&quot; that they are saying &quot;'Black Monday, not Old White Monday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin today said she thinks the economy 'needs some shakin' up and some fixin',' which I'm pretty sure is also her recipe for oven baked chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has &quot;been revealed&quot; that after Sarah Palin became Governor of Alaska, she &quot;had a tanning bed installed in the...Governor's mansion. And...I thought we had the only Governor who covered himself in baby oil and got in a tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course,&quot; Palin's bed &quot;wasn't just&quot; for tanning. In &quot;a pinch, it also&quot; worked &quot;as a moose smoker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, it is interesting that she would have that in the mansion. I guess the plan was not only to overshadow Hillary as the female candidate, but also to overshadow&quot; Barack Obama &quot;as the black candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I swung by my bank today to make a withdrawal. It's now a nail salon,&quot; so that is &quot;not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little update from Wall Street. 'Sell! Sell everything!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it's a nightmare! But God bless him, President Bush has a plan to get us out of this financial mess. It takes place in January, when he leaves office. That's the first step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market crashed this week, but market analysts are not calling it a crash. They're calling it a 'correction.' Oh, shut up! ... You never hear that at NASCAR. 'Oh, we had a fiery correction on turn three. Four men are dead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Reserve has just loaned the AIG insurance company $85 billion to keep it afloat.&quot; That &quot;is almost as much money as Barack Obama raised last night in Beverly Hills. That is ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why are we bailing out an insurance company? I mean, what's the first thing an insurance company does when you have a loss? They cancel your policy, right? That's what we should do, cancel their policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a great dinner last night.&quot; Put &quot;on a Barbra Streisand CD, ordered Domino's, saved $28,488.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Barack Obama hosted a dinner with Barbra Streisand singing. It was $28,500 a plate. ... But, to be fair, that did include an all-you-can-eat salad buffet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the food was pretty exotic. The main course was roasted pig in a lipstick glaze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was in Florida yesterday, John McCain answered the questions that were on the minds of a lot of seniors, like 'What's for dinner?' 'Is it going to be too spicy?' 'If I go outside, will I need a sweater?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain's daughter, Meghan, on the show tonight. She is 84 years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, you know, we have kind of a theme week going on. Last night, we had on Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden. Tonight, we have on John McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain. Tomorrow night, we have on John Edwards' new baby. ... I think Maury Povich is bringing him out. 'You are the father!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today is September 17th. This is Constitution Day, or, as the Bush Administration calls it, Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John McCain said he'll release his medical records by end of the year. He's not stalling, though. He is just old. It is going to take a long time to print out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out on the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton hasn't been mentioning Sarah Palin at all. She's just talking about John McCain. Not surprising. Hillary's always been good at ignoring the 'other woman.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news story today is...Sarah Palin. Every day, Sarah Palin. And it is not exactly hard-hitting stuff. I haven't seen the media fawn over a celebrity this much since -- Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the dirt is beginning to come out. Apparently, one of Sarah's first acts as Governor of Alaska was getting a tanning bed installed in the Governor's mansion. ... The Republican Party is okay with it, which is weird, because usually they ask themselves, 'How can we make our candidate more white?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Barack Obama attended a fundraiser headlined by Barbra Streisand that raised $9 million. ... This was historic&quot; because it was &quot;the most money raised in one night. And it's the first time a black man has ever attended a Barbra Streisand concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife...is angry. She lashed out at the ladies of 'The View' after the McCains appeared on the show. ... In response, Barbara Walters said, 'She's just mad because I dated her husband during the Civil War.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Washington, President Bush met with the cast of the Broadway musical 'The Lion King.' ... There was an awkward moment when Bush called Simba his favorite African leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know that Wells Fargo stagecoach you see in the commercials? ... I saw it heading out of town today, 100 miles an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I went to my bank today. You know the toasters the give you when you open a new account? They asked for it back. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bad out there. ... I went up to the window; they had a sign, 'Teller Carries No More Than $20 Cash.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to the economy, President Bush, no help at all. Like when reporters asked him today what he thought about AIG, he said he got Showtime and HBO but he really didn't get the whole package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the stock market was up 400 points today. Or as Democrats call that, 'Terrible news! That's horrible!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said today, again, he wants to raise taxes on the rich,&quot; provided &quot;if, by November, anyone is still rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that seems to be a theme. In a speech today, Joe Biden said that...paying higher taxes is patriotic. ... In fact, do you know what the Republican strategy on Joe Biden is? Let him keep talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big story in 'USA Today.' They said the days of easy money are over. Well, I'll bet the CEOs of the oil companies had a big laugh over that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democratic-controlled Congress says they're going to adjourn for the rest of the year. This is true. The Senate majority leader said, regarding the financial crisis, no one knows what to do. Well there's a ringing endorsement to reelect them, huh? 'Hey, good luck! You're on your own! We're leaving!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton canceled an appearance at an upcoming rally next week in New York after learning that Sarah Palin would be there. And ironically, Bill Clinton had previously canceled after finding out Hillary would be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Computer hackers have broken into Gov. Sarah Palin's private email account and posted information from it on a website. And of course, Sen. McCain, furious about this breach in security. But again, you know, he's not that computer literate. Like when he heard about the break-in, he ordered Secret Service agents to guard her computer so this never happens again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;is not the only famous person to have&quot; her email account &quot;hacked into. This is a huge problem. Here are some other emails that have been leaked. This one's from Barack Obama. Can we show that email? 'Because of tough economic times we face, I believe the next fundraiser should be reduced to only $20,000 a plate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this was found in Joe Biden's inbox. 'You can swim in it, you can shower with it, you can comb it, and it feels just like your own hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well here's a mass emailing we found that was sent out&quot; by &quot;the chairman of AIG, the insurance company. 'I'm a businessman living in Nigeria with millions of dollars in an offshore account. I need your help to get it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, anybody see Sarah Palin on the Fox News show, 'Hannity &amp; Colmes'? ... Here's my question. What happened to Colmes? Wasn't he supposed to be the Democrat? What, did he get shipped to Guantanamo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Sarah Palin has written a children's book that just came out today. ... It's called 'Good Night Moose.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Olive Garden and...Red lobster announced they're going to have to raise prices to keep up with the economy. But things are okay&quot; because today, &quot;John McCain said, 'Unlimited bread sticks are still fundamentally sound.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news yesterday in Malibu. Actor Ryan O'Neal and his son...were arrested after authorities found methamphetamines in their home. Man. The good news, since it's Malibu, there's a rehab center right across the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the current crisis on Wall Street, President Bush announced just a few hours ago that he's canceled a trip to Alabama. That's true. Yeah, Bush said, 'Under the circumstances, I didn't think it was right to leave the country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, the entire hour of '60 Minutes' will be devoted to Barack Obama and John McCain. ... Yeah. Apparently, Barack Obama will be interviewed,&quot; while &quot;John McCain will fill in for Andy Rooney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week in Colorado, Barack Obama gave a speech in the middle of a rodeo ring. Yeah. Obama began his speech...by saying, 'Hello, I am what is known as a black guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, someone hacked into Sarah Palin's Yahoo! account and read her emails. Yeah. Yeah, reading Palin's email is a great way to hear what she has to say without having to listen to her voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody hacked into vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's email account and posted it all online. Apparently, the hacker was able to figure out her password, which turned out to be bible hockey lipstick gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what Internet security experts believe happened. A hacker disguised in a polar bear skin crawled past the family's sleeping sled dogs and into their igloo. Once inside, he typed a series of keywords into a computer made of deer and moose antlers,&quot; downloaded &quot;the emails on a zip drive, and then made an easy escape through the family ice hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Financial experts are saying we are entering a new chapter in the American economy. I believe it's Chapter 11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, things are not looking good. I opened the business section of the paper today. It said, 'You Don't Want To Know.' That was the headline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how bad the American economy is -- Mexico is now calling for a fence along the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a press conference today outside the Oval Office to talk about the economy. He would have had it inside but, you know, the bank has foreclosed on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush announced...that he will be working with Congress to use hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to restore confidence in the market,&quot; but that was his &quot;second choice to fix the problem. First choice, invade Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama continues to criticize John McCain's economic plan. McCain would like to criticize Obama's economic plan, but nobody knows what it is yet.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama had a big fundraiser in Beverly Hills this past week.&quot; The event provided &quot;world-class gourmet food and Barbra Streisand singing. ... See, that's Barack Obama,&quot; but &quot;at the Ralph Nader fundraiser last night, Double Stuf Oreos and the guys who sang 'Who Let The Dogs Out?' Little different. Not quite as big.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a rally in Florida today, Barack Obama was interrupted by protesters called 'Blacks Against Obama.' And the whole organization showed up. They all drove there together in the same car ? a Mini Cooper, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the members of 'Blacks Against Obama,' pretty serious group, although not nearly as militant as 'Bathroom Attendants Against Larry Craig.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has issued a new warning to Iran that it faces new economic sanctions after reports by the UN atomic watchdog committee that Iran is still enriching uranium. President Bush promising new economic sanctions. And believe me; if there's one thing the President is an expert on, it is ruining a country's economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain raised $5 million at a fundraiser in Florida the other day. See, Florida is a good place to raise money, because people don't have to reach too deep into their pockets. See, the men wear their pants way up here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton cancelled an appearance at the&quot; United Nations &quot;next week after learning that Sarah Palin was also invited. And after Hillary canceled, the group canceled Sarah Palin, saying they didn't want any politicians, which &quot;is a shame because this would have been...Palin's first trip to the&quot; UN. Although &quot;she has been to the International House of Pancakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's husband has refused to testify in an abuse of power investigation in Alaska. He was given a subpoena,&quot; but &quot;he is ignoring it. So it looks like this guy's going to have no trouble fitting into Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Sunday, '60 Minutes' will devote its entire broadcast to profiles of both John McCain and Barack Obama. And of course, McCain really excited about this one,&quot; because with &quot;'60 Minutes,' for once, he gets to be the young guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted the final state dinner of his Presidency,&quot; which &quot;explains why the First Lady finally let him wear his Burger King crown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is so popular in the African town where his father was born&quot; that &quot;they've named a beer after him. ... So next time you're in Africa, sit back, relax, and enjoy a tall, cold Barackelob Light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MoveOn.org has called on...John McCain to release all of his medical records. ... In response, McCain told them, 'Why don't you just come down to the warehouse and look around for yourself? Bring a forklift. It will take time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba announced it's going to team up with Russia to help build a Cuban space program. ... The country's current space program consists of Cubans trying to swim to the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Federal government announced a massive plan to bail out a number of banking institutions. One expert said it may cost Americans...more than a trillion dollars.&quot; To &quot;put that into perspective,&quot; ten &quot;Bill Gates and 35 Oprahs still don't add up to a trillion dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now our attention turns to which candidate can best guide us out of this mess. But even more important than that is deciding which candidate we'd most like to eat nachos with. According to a new survey from the Associated Press,&quot; more &quot;Americans would rather watch a football game with Barack Obama than with John McCain by a margin of 50 to 47%, mostly because McCain has to get up every ten minutes to go to the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the other hand, if you're looking for a candidate to listen to old radio broadcasts of 'Fibber McGee and Molly' with, John McCain, that's your guy right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, last night, they had the 60th Emmy Awards. What a star-studded affair that was. There were more celebrities there than&quot; at a &quot;Barack Obama fundraiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the miniseries 'John Adams' set a new Emmy record last night&quot; with &quot;13 wins. So, a guy from the 1700s can still win today. That is good news for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's how bad the economy is. There are now Americans taking jobs away from illegal aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it is pretty scary, this economy, don't you think? Doesn't it make you yearn for the good old days we were just worried about oil hitting 150 bucks a barrel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is what I love about this whole thing. Congress said...today, 'The days of getting money just for the asking are over!' ... And then they ask for $700 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, you know the way a bailout works? Here's the way a bailout works. A failed president and a failed Congress invest $700 billion of your money in failed businesses. Believe me, this can't fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Iranian president, Mahmoud I'm a nut job ? isn't that his name? ... I think I'm saying it right.&quot; He &quot;has offered to debate John McCain and Barack Obama when he's in New York next week, to which Ralph Nader says, 'What? You can challenge them to a debate? Really? Why wasn't I told?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first presidential debate will take place this Friday night. They say John McCain's challenge will be to distance himself from President Bush,&quot; while &quot;Obama's challenge will be to answer questions before his supporters can start clapping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain&quot; was &quot;a guest on the 'Rachael Ray Show' today. You know, I think he's trying to attract younger voters,&quot; but &quot;I think&quot; the plan &quot;might have backfired on him a little bit. Like when Rachael Ray put something in the microwave, McCain said, 'Hey, that's a pretty fancy bread box you've got there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin said, yes, she did watch Tina Fey portray her in that skit on 'Saturday Night Live.' But she said she watched it with the volume turned down.&quot; That is &quot;right up there with all the other political phrases, isn't it? Remember Clinton's, 'I smoked, but I didn't inhale.' John Kerry, 'I was for it before I was against it.' John McCain's, 'I've fallen and I can't get up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was excited about the Emmys,&quot; including John McCain, who, &quot;during the Emmys, said, 'Uh, 'Gunsmoke' win anything?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is in big trouble,&quot; but &quot;the Bush Administration is now running&quot; it. So &quot;finally some good news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is introducing his running mate, Sarah Palin, to the world leaders over&quot; at the United Nations. And &quot;it was nice. It looked like Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, as the campaign goes on, we're learning more and more about Senator John McCain,&quot; who &quot;apparently...has 13 cars.&quot; But &quot;he can't remember where he parked any of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has been speaking out about the Wall Street bailout. And today, a reporter asked him what he planned to do about AIG. ... Bush got upset and said, 'Why does everyone always spell in front of me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at a big campaign rally, Sarah Palin drew a crowd of 60,000 people. ... Yeah, after hearing about it, Joe Biden got new glasses and a boob job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to vehicle registration records, John and Cindy McCain own 13 cars,&quot; while &quot;Barack and Michelle Obama only have one car. They have one car and the McCains have 13, which, to be fair, is like, only one for each house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Summer's over. It's fall, or as President Bush calls the change in the weather, 'the end of global warming.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when President Bush saw the leaves are starting to fall, he immediately asked for a Federal bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, more bad news from President Bush. Remember those rebate checks from a few months ago? He wants them back. Yeah! We need to give that money to rich people on Wall Street. They need it more than you do!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said today the government's $700 billion bailout should not be a blank check.&quot; Obama &quot;says he knows that $700 billion is a lot of money,&quot; because &quot;it would take him at least 10 Hollywood fundraisers to come up with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a rally in Florida, Barack Obama was interrupted by a protest group calling themselves Blacks Against Obama. Actually, a pretty small group. It's just Condoleezza Rice and Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, went to the United Nations today for the first time. Yeah, how about that? Yeah, up till now, most of her knowledge about foreign countries came from watching 'The Amazing Race.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, she met with the presidents of Afghanistan, Colombia, and Iraq. She was excited because these are all countries you can't see from Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin says she was very impressed with all of the landmarks in New York City. As they were driving over the Hudson River, she said, 'Wow! Your bridges actually go somewhere! This is unbelievable!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell Sarah Palin is not really used to New York City. Like, today, she saw five rats, force of habit, skinned them for the pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to CNN, 1/3 of the electorate is expected to vote early this year. You know what that means? Florida could have already screwed this election up,&quot; and it is &quot;not even October yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten George W. Bush Ideas For Fixing The Economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Why fix it if it ain't broke?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Drill Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for loose change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Sell cupcakes in front of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Flip all them charts upside down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Encourage Americans to spend more. If they don't, Cheney peppers them in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Most things seem better after half a bottle of Jim Beam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Let's just say the Lincoln Memorial is now the Tostitos Lincoln Memorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Invent a car that runs on root beer. Come on, we have an unlimited supply of root beer. And we make it here in America. Am I the only one thinking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Put on a pair of glasses and shoot a moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Is Hillary still available for a 3am phone call?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exciting stuff going on over at the United Nations earlier today. President Bush addressed the UN General Assembly. Apparently, his father couldn't get him out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Ahmadinejad&quot; also &quot;spoke at the UN earlier today. ... This is a guy who hates Jews and gays. Boy is he in the wrong town. Good luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all these world leaders, while they're in New York city over there at the UN,&quot; in &quot;their free time,&quot; they are &quot;doing some shopping. The Japanese premiere, for example, earlier today got a great deal on Morgan Stanley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, John McCain &quot;has been now endorsed by Donald trump.&quot; Sarah Palin, on the other hand, &quot;has been endorsed by LensCrafters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some hackers hacked into Sarah Palin's email. Yep. The same kind of...thing happened to John McCain&quot; when somebody &quot;broke in and stole his Clapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources from Barack Obama's campaign say that during&quot; Friday's first presidential debate, &quot;Obama's going to try to get John McCain to lose his temper. ... Yeah, Obama plans to do this by constantly repeating the phrase, 'Matlock is gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Governor Sarah Palin held a meeting with several leaders from other countries to showcase her foreign policy expertise. That's right, yeah. Experts say the meeting took 90 seconds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, challenged John McCain to a debate.&quot; But McCain &quot;says if he wanted to be attacked by an extremist in an unfair environment, he'd appear on MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of John McCain, in a speech today,&quot; he &quot;said that illegal Irish immigrants in America should be allowed to become citizens. Yeah. When asked why, McCain said, 'Because my wife's family owns Budweiser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Magician David Blaine&quot; is &quot;attempting a new stunt where he hangs upside down for two days and three nights.&quot; If &quot;Blaine's stunt attracts a lot of media attention, then Joe Biden will do the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; made &quot;a farewell speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly. You know, the President is not an eloquent speaker, but I thought he spoke quite powerfully today, especially at the end of his speech when he looked out at all the delegates representing all the nations of the world and...said, 'Can we borrow some money?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain wants to postpone Friday night's presidential debate,&quot; and &quot;he has temporarily suspended his campaign. Yeah, so, apparently, this news about Clay Aiken being gay has affected him more than anybody thought.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no,&quot; McCain &quot;said he'd like to postpone the presidential debate until he's, you know, ahead in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, right after&quot; McCain &quot;announced that, Sarah Palin said, 'That's okay, I don't really need him anyway.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, the real reason&quot; McCain &quot;says he's postponing the debate is to concentrate on the economic crisis. Yeah, yeah. In fact, President Bush spoke to the nation earlier tonight, addressing the financial crisis. He spoke live from the White House panic room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact,&quot; Bush's &quot;speech was broadcast right here at NBC on a special episode of 'The Biggest Loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you even understand this Bush economic plan? ... See, here's how it works. When you screw up, you pay. When they screw up, you pay! Yeah, actually it's very simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? Some financial analysts are saying we're bailing out institutions with money we don't have, which makes the dollar even more worthless. In fact, today, God said, 'Could you take my name off the bill?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Sen. Chris Dodd said that the bailout plan would put the Constitution at risk, to which Bush said, 'Oh, please, we haven't used that old thing in years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, the Iranian President Mahmoud I'm-a-nut-job -- I always get his name&quot; wrong. Anyway, he &quot;was at the UN, and he blamed the United States for the collapse of the global markets. ... Well, that just goes to show you, in a crisis, you really find out who your friends are, huh? Yeah, I guess we can write that guy off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was in New York City this week. She met with some world leaders yesterday and went to the Central Park Zoo.&quot; It took &quot;her five hours to get through the zoo, because she had to keep stopping to reload.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all this week, the McCain campaign has been trying to prevent Sarah Palin from talking to reporters covering the news, you know? They said, 'You can take her picture, but you can't ask her questions.' What is she running for, vice president or 'America's Next Top Model'? I'm not quite sure.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions People Are Asking the John McCain Campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'It's Sarah Palin -- does this mean I'm Pars'dent?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Can't you solve this by selling some of your homes?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Hi, this is Clay Aiken. Is McCain single?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Do you still think the fundamentals of our economy are strong, genius?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Are you doing all this just to get out of going on Letterman?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'What would Matlock do?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Hillary here -- my schedule is free Friday night.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Is this just an excuse to catch up on napping?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'This is President Bush ? what's all this trouble with the economy?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain &quot;was supposed to be on the program tonight,&quot; but &quot;he had to cancel.&quot; He &quot;is suspending his campaign because the economy is exploding.&quot; But nobody &quot;told his vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin,&quot; who is &quot;still circling the theater in the white minivan,&quot; waiting &quot;to pick him up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After McCain canceled being on the show, he rushed right back to Washington to deal with the economic crisis, and I thought, whoa, well, he sure nipped that in the bud, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is &quot;also canceling the&quot; presidential &quot;debate on Friday. ... So that means Barack Obama will now have to debate Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yup, John McCain said to me the economy 'is about to crater.' ... You folks worried about the economy? Whoo! Not me. Not me. I've got all my money in secondhand FEMA trailers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...was at the UN yesterday,&quot; meeting &quot;all the world leaders.&quot; Actually, she is &quot;still learning who the world leaders are.&quot; For example, right now, &quot;she thinks that Warren Buffett is the head of Margaritaville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she was at the General Assembly, Sarah Palin was, and somebody said, 'Look, over there. That's the President of Georgia.'&quot; And Sarah Palin &quot;said, 'Wow, Jimmy Carter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;said, 'Boy, I hope to I get to meet Queen Latifah.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who else is in town at the UN?&quot; Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and &quot;I believe this is his first visit to New York City since his 1970s affair with Barbara Walters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to say a couple of words about&quot; Ahmadinejad, those words being &quot;short and ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John McCain made a big announcement. He said he wants to postpone Friday's presidential debate,&quot; but not &quot;because of the economic crisis. It turns out TV Land is airing a 'Golden Girls' marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight,&quot; President Bush &quot;gave a speech about the Wall Street financial crisis. ... The title of Bush's speech was 'Two More Months And It Ain't My Problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was in New York City this week. While she was here, her family took the ferry to visit the Statue of Liberty. ... When she saw the ferry, Palin said, 'Can't we build a bridge to that thing? It would be easier to get there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has been trying to look younger on the campaign trail&quot; by &quot;using a makeup artist named Tiffany who works on 'American Idol.' True story, yeah. Tiffany says, 'Making John McCain look younger is easy,&quot; but what is &quot;'really hard is making Paula Abdul look sober.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain has announced&quot; he is &quot;putting his campaign for president on hold to focus on the economy. And he wants to postpone his first debate with Barack Obama on Friday, which seems a little bit like the old 'my grandmother died' excuse the night before a final exam. But you have to understand something -- when you have 11 houses, you take a housing crisis very, very seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe him when he says this is a sincere effort, but some think it's a publicity stunt because he announced it while hanging upside down from a crane in Central Park today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say if McCain can't make it to the debates, send a substitute. Send Chuck Norris in. I'd watch that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, our actual President came down from his tree house today to address the nation. And I have to admit,&quot; he &quot;does have an interesting plan to fix the economy. Bake sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush addressed the nation last night. ... How many thought they were watching an episode of 'Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I listened to president Bush's speech. I think I understand this whole economic crisis. See, rich people on Wall Street made a big mess, and they're too rich to clean it up. So the rest of America, you know, their maids and butlers, they have to clean it up for them. You see how easy it is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far...as this whole&quot; $700 billion &quot;thing is concerned, they keep saying, 'We have to act now. We have to act now.' This is like a bad TV offer. 'Just 10 easy payments of $70 billion each. Operators are standing by, but you have to act now!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad the economy is, Wall Street investors are now clinging to their guns and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying our money has lost its value,&quot; but &quot;I dropped $5&quot; today and &quot;I got charged with littering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain got personally involved in the bailout yesterday. He bailed out of 'Letterman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain wants to suspend his debate with Barack Obama until the economic crisis is over. And Sarah Palin now wants to suspend her debate with Joe Biden until she can find Europe on a map.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York City Health Department announced that they gave away more than 39 million condoms last year. ... And apparently, the health department of Alaska didn't give away any.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new medical report, because of global warming, more and more people are suffering from allergies from an increase in tree pollen, to which president Bush said, 'See, I told you trees were nothing but trouble.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Sometimes Sarah calls McCain 'Grandpa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. She stole that sexy librarian look from me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Recently passed legislation to build a bridge to Funkytown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Does great impressions of Tina Fey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Working on a 'Knight Rider' spin-off about a talking snowmobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Favorite book? The Late Show Fun Facts -- available at fine stores everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Once spent a week in the hospital after attempting to put lipstick on a pit bull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To improve her foreign policy experience, she recently went to the International House of Pancakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Only person I know who's not afraid to go hunting with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're here on a good night. So far, none of our guests have cancelled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if you had a chance to get to Central Park,&quot; did &quot;you see that David Blaine&quot; hanging upside-down? They &quot;just left the guy hanging there. It's the same thing McCain did to me last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Hilton is on the program tonight,&quot; unless &quot;she needs to rush to Washington to fix the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people don't know this, but Paris Hilton was actually McCain's first choice for running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt bad about this, because we were all ready to go with John McCain and with an hour to go he cancels.&quot; And &quot;I was thinking about this. John, John, here's how it works. You don't come to see me,&quot; well, &quot;we might not see you on Inauguration Day. That's how it works. You see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain wants the presidential debate postponed until after the big government bailout, you know. Sarah Palin wants the vice presidential debate postponed until after the election. But that's a different deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, John McCain and Sarah Palin were in town all week over at the UN. And he was introducing her to all of the world leaders. It was like Take Your Daughter To Work Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Pakistan actually told Palin that she was gorgeous. But you know, he said the same thing to Joe Biden, so I don't know what the deal is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching the news on television earlier and George Bush says the economy is in danger. Nothing gets past this guy! Wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush has summoned both Obama and McCain to the White House. And what are they going to do, T-ball?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush telephoned both John McCain and Barack Obama to discuss the current financial crisis. ... Yeah, the entire conversation consisted of Bush yelling 'suckers,' and hanging up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then today ? here's the latest. President Bush invited Barack Obama and John McCain to a meeting at the White House this afternoon at 4:00,&quot; or &quot;as McCain calls it, 'just after dinner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the financial crisis, John McCain says he may not appear at the presidential debate on Friday. So Ralph Nader has offered to fill in for him. ... That's true.&quot; However, &quot;Nader is insisting that McCain work his shift at Kinko's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Florida congressman has sparked a big controversy by saying Sarah Palin doesn't care about Jews or black people. ... Palin insists that's not true and says Alaska has one of each.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush met at the White House with both Barack Obama and John McCain. The meeting was...about the financial crisis.&quot; But &quot;McCain showed up without his running mate, Sarah Palin, which is a shame because she...actually has a lot of experience with banking and financial matters. You know, she lives right next to a bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;was in New York at the UN General Assembly to meet with leaders from other countries, because previously, her world experience had been limited to a visit to the Epcot Center in Orlando.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain suspended his presidential campaign yesterday to focus on the financial crisis.&quot; McCain &quot;asked Barack Obama to join him and postpone the debate they have scheduled for tomorrow night in Mississippi.&quot; But McCain does want &quot;to reschedule&quot; the debate, &quot;preferably&quot; until &quot;some time after the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Jim Lehrer began proceedings with, 'Which one of you morons wants to go first?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. McCain answered every question by cupping his ear and saying, 'How's that?'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Opened with closing statements, closed with opening statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. McCain said he had more fun at the Lincoln-Douglas debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Everybody was talking about the new 'Late Show Fun Facts' book available at bookstores everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. McCain pledged to fill entire cabinet with sassy, underqualified hockey moms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Obama said he'll be on next season's 'Dancing With The Stars' -- this guy will do anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Both had uncomfortable restroom stories involving Senator Larry Craig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. They picked some guy out of the audience from New Jersey to read a Top Ten list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The winner -- Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, the first presidential debate,&quot; which &quot;was about foreign policy. And my favorite part of the debate was the name that dictator lightning round.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the presidential debate had an unusual format. After blowing a question on Bosnia, John McCain was told to extinguish his torch and leave the island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, McCain's big mistake was not knowing the name of French President Sarkozy's hot wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three presidential debates...will be held in three different states -- Mississippi, New York, and Tennessee. And fortunately, John McCain has a home in each one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it's autumn in New York City. Leaves are falling. Also bonds, stocks, everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the economy is in sad shape but good news. President Bush says that he is working hard on the economic problems of this country. Well! That's good enough for me, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a crazy week. Barrack Obama, of course, is still on the campaign trail with his family. Michelle Obama says she keeps their kids entertained by throwing slumber parties. Coincidentally, that's how Bill Clinton kept himself entertained during his campaign. So it all comes full circle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, before we begin, I want to warn people in Nigeria who might be watching our show.&quot; If &quot;you get any emails from Washington asking for money, it's a scam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the bailout was voted down,&quot; and people &quot;are stunned. Nancy Pelosi was so shocked, if she could have made a facial expression, she would have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the big problem was the plan came in two parts and they couldn't agree on which part to implement first, the smoke or the mirrors.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today at CNBC, they said without a bailout, consumers wouldn't be able to get credit cards at favorable rates. Oh, that takes some getting used to, huh? You mean they've been spoiling us with that low 30% interest?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And once again, you know, President Bush, God bless him, nice man, but I don't think he understands the gravity of this situation. Like when someone told him WaMu went under, he said, 'Well, that's okay, he's a whale.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This crisis has actually affected the way children play. Like when kids play Monopoly now, the dumbest kid is the banker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll give you an idea how bad the economy is. I wrote a $5 check over the weekend. The check was good, the bank bounced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll give you an idea of how bad the dollar is. Went to buy gold. They said, 'You can only buy it with gold.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the guy in the Rolls-Royce with the Grey Poupon had to switch to French's mustard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all watch the presidential debate Friday night?&quot; A &quot;lot of analysts were calling it a tie. They say neither man stumbled. See, that's how low the bar is now,&quot; when &quot;not stumbling is considered a huge accomplishment in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the way the moderator, Jim Lehrer, tried to get both candidates to talk to each other. What are we, in couples counseling now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...watched the debate very closely,&quot; with &quot;one eye&quot; on it &quot;and the other eye, of course, on Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Republicans are worried about how Sarah Palin is going to do in the vice presidential debate this Thursday.&quot; She should just &quot;let Joe Biden have the first question. He'll take 90 minutes to answer. 'Oh, we're out of time!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you hear about this? Hugh Hefner has asked Sarah Palin to pose naked for 'Playboy.' Yeah, it's unbelievable. Of course, right now, you know, she's busy posing as a vice presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, think about that. If she did do it, she could be the first playmate on a bear skin rug she shot herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Features Of The Rejected $700 Billion Bailout:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. First 500 billion comes from Regis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. If this bailout fails, promise of another $700 billion bailout to bailout the bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. To give Americans a break, this week gas is being lowered to 9 bucks a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. For $20 you can bail yourself out with the hilarious Late Show Fun Facts book available now!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A billion dollars to rebuild the Mets bullpen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Instead of securities, they're now called 'insecurities.' Hey, you've been great. Enjoy Richard Lewis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. For some reason, Halliburton gets $500 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No number 3 -- economy so bad writer sold computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Everything west of the Mississippi will be sold to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President Bush must send every American a 'Sorry I'm a dumbass' card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rough day on Wall Street. You went down there; you could see all of the brokers taking a smoke break out on the ledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of...mathematicians have discovered the largest prime number,&quot; which &quot;has 13 million digits. ... Coincidentally, that is the price tag on the Federal bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush now says that the taxpayers could actually make a profit on this&quot; bailout &quot;deal. Well, that's good enough for me. Let's go, come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you believe&quot; President Bush, &quot;I have Yankees and Mets World Series tickets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain is in favor of the bailout. He loves bailouts. He bailed out on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks like celebrity birthdays?&quot; You &quot;know whose birthday it is today? Kelly Ripa. ... Little known fact about Kelly Ripa -- she was John McCain's first choice as a running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a terrible day on Wall Street,&quot; and &quot;Congress has botched this bailout deal. Experts on Wall Street say it's the biggest disaster to hit the city since the New York Mets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a couple of days, but everyone is still talking about the debate. ... No one agrees on who won,&quot; though. Republicans &quot;say McCain won. Democrats say Obama won. Bill Clinton says Hillary won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the House of Representatives voted against the Wall Street bailout plan, a plan which House Minority Leader John Boehner called a 'crap sandwich.'&quot; Congress is &quot;already working on a new plan, which they call a 'crap sandwich with cheese.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, today,&quot; when &quot;the stock market closed, it was down 777 points, which is the biggest point drop in American history. ... As a result, President Bush was able to cross off the tenth and final item on his Administration's bucket list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential debate was held Friday. Many observers are split on who won. Yeah. Some say Barack Obama won by showing he could hold his own,&quot; while others &quot;say that John McCain won by showing he could hold his bladder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics are still analyzing Sarah Palin's interview with Katie Couric last week. And...they're saying she was halting, repetitive, and stumped on basic questions. Yeah. In other words, Palin appeared very presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hugh Hefner has asked Sarah Palin to pose nude for 'Playboy' magazine.&quot; Palin &quot;said she'd agree to pose for 'Playboy' as long as there's no interview.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Rosh Hashanah!&quot; With the holiday, Congress is not in session. Coincidentally, &quot;the stock market made a big comeback today. See, that's the key to saving the economy. Send these idiots home so they can't screw up anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congress voted against the bailout. See, the problem&quot; in this case is that &quot;members of Congress...were told to vote their conscience. And of course, this totally confused them. 'Conscience?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lawmakers that are for the bailout argued that the government could actually end up making money on this deal,&quot; in much the same way that &quot;the government made money on Amtrak and the Post Office.&quot; Oh yeah, &quot;that money is just rolling in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right after&quot; the bailout &quot;vote, President Bush met behind closed doors with his economic team. Yeah, that was my thought too. Bush has an economic team?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course,&quot; in Congress, &quot;both parties continue to point fingers at each other, as opposed to the rest of the country, which is just giving the finger to Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Republicans are blaming Nancy Pelosi for the bailout not going through,&quot; but &quot;Democrats are blaming it on an incomplete proposal by the Republicans.&quot; John McCain, meanwhile, &quot;is blaming Barack Obama,&quot; Barack Obama &quot;is blaming John McCain,&quot; and &quot;Sarah Palin is praying nobody asks her what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, John McCain and Sarah Palin introduced a new 'Just Say No' program. McCain told Sarah Palin, 'If a reporter asks you any questions, just say no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Cadbury chocolate company has recalled some of the chocolate bars due to tainted milk made from China. ... Is there anything that comes from China that doesn't kill you now?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Once a week, bank president is led away in handcuffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Four out of five bank tellers are kitties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Was a Savings and Loan; now a Savings and Loan and Chicken Shack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Vault' is the trunk of a late model Chevy Malibu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. When you check account balance, ATM screen reads, 'What money, sucka?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. They tell bank robbers, 'Sorry, the CEO beat you to it.' It makes you laugh and it makes you think, people!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. They tried to borrow money from you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When you ask where your money is, they say in an adorable Alaska accent, 'I'll try to find it and I'll bring it to ya!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Instead of a mint, teller offers you an anti-depressant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Rosh Hashanah! It's Jewish New Year. Down in Washington DC, a confused George Bush today pardoned a bagel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard the news&quot; that &quot;the House killed the bailout plan. So Washington failed to act? Oh, I didn't see that coming. Wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now the only winner in this economic mess is...vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;has all her money in pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...we have the big vice presidential debate coming up on Thursday,&quot; and &quot;Sarah Palin is busy preparing.&quot; Right now, for example, &quot;she is practicing her caribou caught in the lights look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, Sarah Palin is currently rehearsing for the debate, but &quot;insiders tell me it's not going that well because she keeps saying, 'I'd like to buy a vowel, Pat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the stock market...suffered its biggest one-day drop in history,&quot; falling &quot;777 points. I'm telling you, boy, it's a good thing John McCain blew me off to go save the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview today, Barack Obama forgot which wedding anniversary he celebrates this year.&quot; In response, Michelle Obama &quot;changed the name of&quot; Barack's campaign &quot;slogan from 'yes we can' to 'yes you can sleep on the couch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is in Arizona all week preparing for Thursday's vice presidential debate. She said she went to Arizona 'because it's fun to visit other countries.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; the &quot;Dow Jones average dropped 777 points, which wiped out $1.2 trillion in the stock market. ... Financial experts say the last time that much money disappeared in one day was when Oprah left her purse in a cab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big bailout plan that was supposed to save everything failed yesterday. Political experts say if a new version of the economic bailout plan is going to pass, significant changes are going to have to be made. Yeah. For instance, Congress is going to have to remove the section of the plan that says, 'Sweet Jesus, please let this work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now yesterday, John McCain said that Federal aid to Wall Street shouldn't be called a 'bailout,' but instead should be called a 'rescue.' Yeah. McCain also said he's not old, he's 'geezerific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is talking about stimulus checks again. The bad news ? we're the ones that are writing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to panic people by saying the banks are doing badly,&quot; but at &quot;my bank today, they stole my pen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress now has a 10% approval rating. ... How many people think that's way too high?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new poll shows that only one out of four people approve of the job President Bush is doing. ... That means when he's having dinner with his wife and two daughters, he's the only one at the table who thinks he's doing a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, there was a big Hollywood fundraiser for John McCain. I don't want to say there weren't a lot of celebrities there, but it was billed as the 'Night of One Star.' Yeah, I think...it was Chuck Norris.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the...vice presidential debate is tomorrow night. Joe Biden already gearing up. I understand he went to the hair salon, told the guy to put a little more on top just to get ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin&quot; also &quot;getting ready.&quot; In fact, &quot;I understand she now knows all three branches of government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think Sarah Palin took a swipe at Joe Biden's age when she said that she had been listening to Biden's speeches since the second grade, which is kind of ironic because Biden has been listening to McCain's speeches since he was in the second grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, you've got to admit, Sarah Palin does look great when she walks out, but that's causing a problem for McCain now. In fact, now they're starting to call the ticket 'Beauty and the Deceased.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political activists are now saying if Sarah Palin does not do well tomorrow in the debate, she will voluntarily step down from the ticket by Friday.&quot; But &quot;there have been over 2 million emails and phone calls urging her to stay, all from Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest trend in business now is car rental companies renting cars by the hour. ... See, that's when you know the economy is shaky. You're on a business trip, you're not sure if your company is going to last until the end of the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard at Sarah Palin's Debate Camp:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Let's practice your bewildered silence.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Can you try saying 'Yes' instead of 'You betcha?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Hey, I can see Mexico from here!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Maybe we'll get lucky and there won't be any questions about Iraq, taxes, or healthcare.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'We're screwed!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Can I just use that lipstick-pit bull thing again?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'We have to wrap it up for the day -- McCain eats dinner at 4:30.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Can we get Congress to bail us out of this debate?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'John Edwards wants to know if you'd like some private tutoring in his van.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Any way we can just get Tina Fey to do it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date, ladies and gentlemen, in 1881, you know what happened? The New York Stock Exchange moved to a newer, larger location.&quot; And earlier today, the &quot;stock market moved to a basement apartment in Queens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you follow all of the stock indices, like the Dow Jones? ... You take a look at the chart of the Dow Jones, it looks like an OJ Simpson lie detector graph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hugh Hefner...asked Sarah Palin to pose naked for 'Playboy' magazine. I know, but it's quite an honor, honestly. The last vice presidential candidate to be asked to pose naked was Lloyd Bentsen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sarah Palin will be in tomorrow night's vice presidential debate, &quot;also known as the 'Debate to Nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching the Sarah Palin interview with Katie Couric on the 'CBS Evening News?' Pretty interesting. Sarah Palin could not...remember the name of a newspaper or a magazine that she reads. And I...was thinking, wow, possibly a leader of the country who doesn't read. And then I thought...it's worked pretty&quot; well &quot;for George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;Sarah Palin is nothing if not diligent. She's working hard on preparing for the debate with Joe Biden.&quot; In fact, &quot;we just heard that&quot; earlier today in Arizona, Sarah Palin &quot;shot a donkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;I don't know if&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;is ready. You know you're in trouble, debating like this,&quot; when &quot;your...goal is to do as well as Dan Quayle did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sarah Palin is &quot;nothing if not savvy. She's trying to change the...format&quot; of the debate. What &quot;she wants now is to guess the retail price of stuff. That's what she would like to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin right now is training for tomorrow night's...debate in Arizona.&quot; And &quot;she says it has really helped her on foreign policy because from Arizona she can see Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody,&quot; and it is a &quot;great day for Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;has been practicing for the big debate tomorrow night and apparently is doing well. Palin's staff has tried to find a stand-in to pretend to be Joe Biden, but so far all they've come up with is a tree stump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said he turns to Sarah Palin for foreign policy advice, and then he turns to his wife Cindy to get her to cut the meat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a scary day in Washington today. They found a hand grenade in a park. At first, they thought the worst,&quot; but it &quot;turns out Dick Cheney went for a walk and it fell out of his pocket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the bailout plan, that's what everyone's talking about now. Congress trying very hard, once again, with this bailout plan. And economists are now claiming...that our nation's leaders did not properly explain the bailout plan to the public. That was the problem, yeah. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'While you're at it, could someone explain it to me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that John McCain is taking an herbal supplement to improve his memory. ... Apparently, McCain is having trouble remembering why he picked Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg in the news&quot; because he &quot;said he's interested in running for another term.&quot; There is resistance, however, &quot;because the law would have to be changed to allow for a third term. Yeah, it's not that people have a big problem with Mike Bloomberg. They just don't want to give President Bush any ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The much anticipated vice presidential debate takes place tomorrow night in St. Louis. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware faces off with Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Teams of technicians very working around the clock trying to figure out how to run an Internet cable directly into the back of&quot; Palin's &quot;skull to feed her...information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though Governor Palin is not expected to do particularly well in tomorrow night's debate, she is favored heavily in Friday night's swimsuit competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate passed the bailout bill,&quot; and they &quot;said one of the reasons it passed is that lawmakers stopped calling it a bailout bill and started calling it a rescue bill. See, they changed...the name. I'm sorry. Isn't that called putting lipstick on a pig?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Senate passed&quot; the bill &quot;last night, and they say the House will probably pass it tomorrow. In fact, the only thing that could screw it up is if John McCain steps in and tries to help out again.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and I love this part! With the new provisions the Senate added,&quot; the bill is &quot;now going to cost $800 billion! We should have signed it two days ago, when it was just $700 billion. Two days later, they screwed us out of another $100 billion!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And do you know this bailout ? I'm sorry, the rescue...bill -- has grown to 450 pages? And President Bush's copy is even thicker, because they had to add pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they say the bailout bill is on the Internet, and they're encouraging people to read it. ... It breaks the $800 billion down&quot; into &quot;how it's spent. And there are various worksheets and they want us to study it. Oh, shut up! You know, I can't figure out the charges on my two-page, $60 phone bill, okay, how am I going to read this? Nobody is going to read this stupid thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, speaking of that, NBC has a new reality show premiering next week, 'Last Bank Standing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; these &quot;banks are in bad shape.&quot; For example, &quot;I opened a new account today, it gave me an IOU for a toaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man. I got my statement today. It just said, 'Your guess is as good as ours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is &quot;bad everywhere.&quot; Last &quot;night, I'm watching 'Wheel of Fortune,' one of the contestants wanted to buy a vowel, couldn't afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, at the urging of my financial adviser, I'm diversifying where I put my money. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. The key is diversification. Well, I got some in the backyard, some in the crawl space, some in the mattress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today if our nation continues on this course, the economic damage will be 'painful and lasting.' But the good news, after eight years of Bush, we can handle painful and lasting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier...tonight, they held the vice presidential debate,&quot; and &quot;I understand that Sarah Palin&quot; was &quot;preparing all week&quot; for it &quot;at John McCain's ranch in Arizona. She said looking out at the desert gave her a real feel for the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that interview with Katie Couric? Katie Couric &quot;asked Sarah Palin what newspapers she reads, and she could not name a single newspaper that she reads, which wouldn't be so bad if she didn't have a degree in journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting. According to a recent poll, 61% of people surveyed said they'd rather see Sarah Palin in a bikini than Pamela Anderson. ... Although, 99% said they'd rather see Pamela Anderson as vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a company that produces dolls of all the political figures&quot; just &quot;came out with a Joe Biden doll. Apparently, the hair is so unrealistic, it looks just like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is putting his Phoenix mansion up for sale. The house has 13 bedrooms, 10 fireplaces, and a Carrows Restaurant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In international news, the man considered to be the leader of the Taliban...inside of Pakistan has died of kidney failure. See, that's when you know the war on terrorism has gone on too long, when our enemies are dying of natural causes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a company in Texas has come out with a device that can tell you where all your friends and relatives are at any given moment by tracking them using GPS technology. Why are we keeping track of our friends and relatives?&quot; Osama bin Laden &quot;has been hiding for what, seven years? I know where Grandma is, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an additional 31 batches of Chinese milk powder were found to be contaminated with the chemical melamine. ... Here's how bad that Chinese milk powder is for you. Today, Amy Winehouse was caught snorting it, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In sports news, the Raiders fired their coach four games into the season. You know, folks on Wall Street should take note of this. You can fire people when they're not doing a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And US auto sales are down...because of this whole financial mess thing. There isn't much money to lend to customers, so the customers aren't there. In fact, it has gotten so bad,&quot; the &quot;car salesmen are having to lie to each other now just to keep in practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises in the Vice Presidential Debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. First question for Palin: 'Why in the hell do you keep agreeing to talk to Katie Couric?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. As a welcome to the candidates, St. Louis constructed a special 'arch to nowhere.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. To even the playing field, Biden wore stilettos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A confused John McCain kept stumbling onstage asking where he was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Most of discussion was what to do about the Mets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Palin bore a striking resemblance to Mitt Romney in a wig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Only thing the candidates agreed on? The Late Show Fun Facts book: 240 pages of jam-packed hilarity!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Biden's insistence that from his house in Delaware he can see Russia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. You could hear Hillary's muffled screams from the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Palin mentioned bombing Iran, Pakistan, and Tina Fey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to bring up a sad, sore topic but how about the economy? I mean, does it stink?&quot; The &quot;economy is so bad that today, Dick Cheney was waterboarding his stockbroker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate passed the bailout bill after loading it with pork.&quot; It &quot;just doesn't seem right to me to pass a bill like that on Rosh Hashanah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching Sarah Palin's interviews with Katie Couric? Last night, Palin told... Couric&quot; that &quot;she can't name a Supreme Court ruling that she disagrees with. The best she could come up with was the time Judge Judy ruled against the landlord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin did say she objected to several Paula Abdul rulings on 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin did say there is one decision that she disagrees with. And that was the decision to do the interview with Katie Couric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But how about that debate earlier tonight, huh?&quot; Is &quot;it just me or whenever Sarah Palin was asked a question,&quot; was &quot;there...a long pause? You know, like when you have a foreign correspondent and there's a satellite delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...if it gets worse,&quot; John McCain &quot;has a backup plan. He's going to dump Sarah Palin and replace her with Bonnie Hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one thing about&quot; the vice presidential debate &quot;that I really loved&quot; was &quot;the back and forth arguing&quot; on &quot;both sides of the issues. And that was just Joe Biden...talking to himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say what you will,&quot; but &quot;I think one of the most embarrassing moments of the whole night was when Joe Biden had to say 'Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening to the question. I was thinking about Sarah naked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;I...give Sarah Palin a lot of credit. I thought she did pretty well in the debate. After all, she was in over her hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the pundits are already saying that she did fine. ... Yeah, okay, she did fine, but she also was very, very lucky. I mean, come on, there were three moose questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is a bit of a celebrity,&quot; and people &quot;say that's why he breaks fundraising records. But John McCain breaks records too -- usually vinyl records as he forces them into his CD player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vice presidential debate is tonight, and it's big.&quot; Political experts &quot;are saying that to succeed in tonight's debate, Sarah Palin needs to show that she has the same concerns as everyday Americans. That's what they said. Yeah. For instance, Palin planned to start the debate by saying she's really troubled by John McCain's choice for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say that one mistake by to Sarah Palin night could be crushing to John McCain's campaign. Yeah. However, they say 20 or 30 mistakes by Palin could be really funny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's still talking about Sarah Palin's interview with Katie Couric, where Palin was unable to answer a question about the Supreme Court.&quot; Apparently, &quot;Palin thought the Supreme Court was a regular court with extra cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry Flynt announced he's making a porn movie with a Sarah Palin look-alike. ... John McCain called the idea offensive, Barack Obama called it inappropriate,&quot; but Bill Clinton &quot;said he'll reserve judgment until he sees the film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study has found that the number...of illegal immigrants coming into the United States has declined as our economy has faltered. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Do I know how to fix a problem or what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. According to a recent poll that just came out, the majority of McCain voters think the economy is in a normal downward cycle, but the majority of Obama voters think the economy is in a long-term decline. Yeah. Meanwhile, the majority of Ralph Nader voters collect empty beer cans along the highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the &quot;first and only vice presidential debate took place tonight,&quot; Joe Biden's team &quot;said his strategy would be to avoid attacking&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;directly and instead focus his attacks on linking&quot; John McCain &quot;to President Bush and the economy. Palin's people,&quot; on the other hand, &quot;said her strategy would be to stay upwind of Biden, flush him out into an open area, and then go for a clean shot through the lungs. You don't want to mess with the head. That's the trophy, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;big question -- and I don't know if anyone has asked it -- while Sarah Palin is yammering it up with Joe Biden,&quot; who is &quot;keeping an eye on the Russians? I feel very unprotected right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all watch the vice presidential debate last night? Yeah, there was nothing embarrassing from either candidate. Damn!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, political analysts say it was a strong debate by both candidates and there were no losers...other than gay people who want to get married.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, both sides are spinning it, you know. The Republicans say, 'Oh, Joe Biden got beaten by a girl.' And Democrats are crying elder abuse. So between the two of them,&quot; it is &quot;all pretty fair.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They determined who got the first question by a coin toss, to which Sarah Palin said, 'Oh, what a coincidence. That's how I was picked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin seemed genuinely happy to be there. She said she was privileged. And it was a thrill for Joe Biden too,&quot; who &quot;got to talk directly to the American people on television, just the way FDR did when the stock market crashed in 1929.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin kept winking at the camera. ... For a minute, I thought maybe John McCain had been captured again and she was trying to send some kind of a signal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that last night, Sarah Palin quoted both Ronald Reagan and Goober from 'The Andy Griffith Show.' What was all that 'you betcha'? 'Golly gee, gosh darn it.' I thought she was doing 'Annie Get Your Gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the most controversial thing Sarah Palin said last night was she felt the vice president should have more power. More power? Dick Cheney is shooting people in the face and doesn't even get arrested. You cannot get any more powerful than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said he watched the debate from his living room at his home in Arizona. He said he would have applauded Sarah Palin, but every time he claps at home, the lights go on and off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they passed their $800 billion bailout bill today. Although, some senators who voted for it are now very upset,&quot; because they &quot;thought they were giving themselves a pay raise. They had no idea what they were voting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some economists say all this bill really is a bailout for companies whose bad business judgment ran their companies into the ground, to which NBC said, 'Really? We should be eligible. We should be getting some of that money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this part. Congress keeps saying that not only are taxpayers going to get back the $800 billion, oh, they're going to make money on the deal too. Yeah, yeah. See, now you know where the 'con' in congressman comes from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, this...bill went from a three-page document to the size of a novel, literally. It's the size of a book. You know what that means? Bush will never read it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now Europe is trying to put together&quot; its &quot;own bailout plan. ... Hey, say what you want about America, but we're still leading the rest of the world. See what I'm saying? We were bankrupt months before them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Messages Left On Sarah Palin's Answering Machine:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Hi, it's John McCain; I had to go to bed. How'd it go?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Hi, Katie Couric here. Have you thought of a Supreme Court case yet?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Hi, it's Bill Clinton. Let me know when Todd's out of town.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'My name is Joseph Sixpack -- knock it off.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Hi, Katie Couric again -- think of any newspapers yet?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Buy the Late Show Fun Facts book. It's a bridge to hilarity.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'John McCain again; could you pick up my prescriptions?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Senator Larry Craig here -- do you have Joe Biden's phone number?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'McCain again; do you remember where I parked the Straight Talk Express?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's President Bush. If you're at the debate, who's watchin' Russia?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks worried about the economy? Kind of grim, don't you think? Well, here's some good news. The bailout plan has been passed&quot; after &quot;it went from $700 billion to $800 billion,&quot; because if the plan cost &quot;the taxpayers more,&quot; there was a &quot;better chance that Congress&quot; would &quot;vote for it. So that's...what happened there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the debate last night?&quot; They are &quot;saying that Sarah Palin actually did pretty well and that Joe Biden avoided any verbal gaffes. And I'm thinking, well, what fun was that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And everybody has been asking me, Dave, did you see the debate last night. And my answer of course, is, you betcha!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, you see them standing there together,&quot; Palin and Biden, and they looked &quot;like the Channel 9 News team, didn't they, a little bit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the debate, of course, Sarah Palin goes up to Sen. Biden and says, 'Is it alright if I call you Joe?' And he says, 'Is it alright if I call you smokin' hot!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this,&quot; but Sarah Palin's &quot;family was sitting in the front row, and halfway through the debate, her future son-in-law made a run for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then during the debate, Palin winked, wrinkled her nose, and gave a shout out to a third grade class.&quot; That &quot;says commander-in-chief to me right there. All of that. You betcha!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what this means, but after the debate, Sarah Palin received a congratulatory call from Bill Clinton. What is that all about? What's going on there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say that Sarah Palin after last night has locked up the vote of the people who pronounce the word 'nucular.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she kept reaching out to Joe Sixpack. She kept invoking Joe Sixpack. That is because her answers make more sense after six beers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, the debate was such a hit that today in Times Square, all of the hookers had their hair in the Sarah Palin beehive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And not only here but the people in Wasilla, Alaska, went crazy&quot; as well &quot;after Sarah Palin's performance last night.&quot; In fact, a &quot;bunch of rowdy kids went nuts after the debate.&quot; They went &quot;running around&quot; and &quot;tipped over a caribou.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential race is really heating up now. I'm excited about it. During an interview, John McCain said he's not a rich man. It's true. At least two of his seven houses are in so-so neighborhoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night's vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin drew much higher ratings than the presidential debate. ... Yeah, Biden attracted viewers who enjoyed his previous debate appearances and Palin attracted viewers who enjoyed the movie 'Fargo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush signed the Wall Street bailout bill, but he said our economy continues to face serious challenges. Yeah. Yeah, Bush said he thought those challenges could be overcome as soon as he leaves office in two months.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey, only 25% of Americans think Sarah Palin is qualified to be president, which sounds bad, but only 10% think Bush is qualified, so really not that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the vice presidential debate, Sarah Palin would wink a couple of times when she delivered a line. Did you see that? She'd kind of wink and...try to use a little sex appeal. See, the other candidates could never get away with that. Like if Barack Obama winked, that would be seen as too condescending. If Joe Biden winked, it'd be too creepy. If McCain started winking, everybody would think he was having a stroke.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the debate the other night, the moderator asked Sarah Palin to describe her Achilles heel, but instead of talking about her biggest weakness, she talked about her greatest strength, which apparently is not answering questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people watched the debates hoping Sarah Palin would screw up? Just be honest. How many watched hoping Joe Biden would screw up? How many watched the baseball game knowing the Cubs would screw up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is not good. This week, the Labor Department announced that 159,000 people lost their jobs last month. Worst job loss in five years. But here's the ironic part,&quot; all &quot;435 members of Congress still have their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, on Friday, Washington passed the big 'Save Our CEOs' program. That thing passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Richard Fuld,&quot; the &quot;former CEO of Lehman Brothers, grilled by Congress today. And they...made him explain why he took $480 million in compensation when he knew some shareholders would lose their life savings. Yeah. Turns out, he had a good reason. Apparently, he is a greedy bastard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market did so bad, instead of a closing bell; they played 'Taps.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Price of oil dropped below $90 a barrel today. I guess the oil companies backed off screwing the American public now that the Federal government has taken on the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said this is good, the price falling, because...now people can afford to drive the cars they're living in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Bangkok, a candidate for governor beat up a TV reporter for asking him tough questions. Today Sarah Palin said, 'You can do that? Where's Katie Couric?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways To Make the Financial Crisis More Fun:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Take a page from President Bush and ignore it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. When Dow Jones drops more than 800 points, every American gets free mozzarella sticks at Applebee's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Replace Lehman Brothers with the Wayans Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. File for bankruptcy three times and the fourth one is free!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Invest half your portfolio in liquor, the other half in strippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Goodbye repo men, hello repo monkeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Don't call it a 'bailout' or a 'rescue,' call it a 'fun-nancial crisis.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Put it all on Ball State and give the 16 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Enjoy blank stare when Katie Couric asks Sarah Palin what 'FDIC' stands for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hire O.J. and his goons to steal back your money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should we talk about the stock market?&quot; Today, talk &quot;about your roller coaster,&quot; it &quot;dropped 800 points. Whoa, so thank you, bailout rescue plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the economy is going to hell but at least we're getting leadership from the White House. That's the important thing, ladies and gentlemen. Thank God for that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in. A backwoods hiker has found the wreckage of John McCain's campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now we got like 28 more days and the campaign is getting ugly. ... Barack Obama called&quot; John McCain &quot;'erratic.' And in response to those charges, McCain responded by yelling, 'Turn down that damn music!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about Sarah Palin? Well, yesterday she referred to Afghanistan as our neighboring country. Yeah. Apparently, she can see bin Laden's cave from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now she's going crazy, Sarah Palin. She is ready to go, she is saying now, 'the heels are on, and the gloves are off.' And that's the kind of thing that used to cost Eliot Spitzer a thousand bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is very feisty and she's upset now with John McCain for pulling out of Michigan. And apparently, McCain is getting on her nerves, so earlier today she called Kelly Ripa...to get some advice for dealing with a geezer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Wall Street thing. ... At this point, it's a race to see what drops faster, the stock market or John McCain's poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's campaign...has closed their offices in Michigan and they say they won't try to compete for votes there. ... Yeah, apparently, this is part of McCain's strategy to try to win votes only in the original 13 colonies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the debates were held earlier tonight. A little awkward at the beginning of the debate when Barack Obama took a page from Sarah Palin's book when he walked over to John McCain and said, 'Can I call you old?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, tonight's presidential debate took place in Nashville, Tennessee, which is perfect because the economy right now is kind of like a bad country song, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's presidential debate was actually what they called town hall style, which means instead of ignoring the moderator's questions, the candidates can ignore the voters directly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it's a town hall format, which is John McCain's favorite way to speak to crowds, as opposed to Barack Obama's favorite way, a Sermon on the Mount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Boca Raton, Florida, yesterday, a woman who looked like Sarah Palin caused a near riot when she walked into a diner for breakfast.&quot; But &quot;after a minute or two, people finally realized it wasn't her when she started answering questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin attacking Barack Obama for 'palling around' with terrorists, like this William Ayers guy.&quot; Apparently, Ayers was &quot;a '60s radical who allegedly once set off a bomb in a...men's room.&quot; When he heard about the bombing, &quot;Sen. Larry Craig said, 'The guy's an animal!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife, Cindy McCain, has won the 'Family Circle' magazine presidential cookie contest. Cindy won with a recipe for oatmeal butterscotch cookies -- narrowly beating out Michelle Obama with her recipe for macadamia nut cookies filled with hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, John McCain says his wife's cookies are so soft, he can eat them without even putting his teeth in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, with all...of the excitement about the election, it's easy to forget about President Bush.&quot; But &quot;next year, he'll be unemployed and he'll be at that awkward age -- too young to retire, yet too old to decimate another nation's economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in Australia has a rare medical condition that causes her eyes to clamp shut for three days at a time. ... Yeah, kind of like banking regulators in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's response to this economic crisis was to meet with some small business owners at a soda shop in San Antonio, Texas, this week. Well, the bad news, the small business owners are now General Motors, General Electric,&quot; and &quot;Century 21.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think...President Bush even understands what's going on? Like, today, they asked about the credit crunch -- he said it was his favorite candy bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You're Watching A Bad Presidential Debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. It's a town hall debate, but the town is in a mountainous region of Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Tom Brokaw leaves early to catch 9:15 showing of 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Topics fall into the categories 'Domestic policy,' 'Foreign policy,' and 'Burt Reynolds films of the '70s.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Keep arguing about who has more friends on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Candidate says, 'Why you hatin'?' Other responds, 'Why you buggin'?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It's covered by CBS, NBC, ABC, and the Howard 100 News team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Candidates ignore questions and gossip about which Senate pages are sluts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The yodeling competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Disproportionate amount of questions about 'The Hills.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's 90 minutes of folksy phrases and winking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the 'Late Show.' I'm your host, Dave Sixpack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Donald Trump is hurting because of the economy. Today, Donald trump took that thing on his head to the pound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here in the depressing economy, the real winner is OJ Simpson. ... He's got 25 to life of free room and board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you folks see the second presidential debate?&quot; It &quot;got off to an awkward start when a confused John McCain said to Barack Obama, 'May I call you Joe?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this was...what they call the town hall format. And that means that the candidates get to walk around on stage.&quot; And it was &quot;pretty successful&quot; because &quot;John McCain only wandered off twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain was on stage with a hand&quot; microphone, but you &quot;could tell he was confused when he started singing 'Sweet Caroline.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. He looks like the guy who thinks he's the neighborhood sheriff, you know? One of those guys. 'You better tie up those trash bags or we're going to get raccoons. Come on. Get 'em! We're going to get the raccoons.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this presidential debate was held in Nashville, Tennessee, and I think according to Sarah Palin that borders Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like I said, this was the second presidential debate for John McCain and Barack Obama. I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, things are really starting to look bad for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Hillary Clinton is still around, still getting it done. Hillary Clinton says, 'America needs to be fixed.' America needs to be fixed. And it's the same thing she said years ago about Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wasn't the debate fantastic? It was town hall format. I like that. Candidates can walk around freely. McCain was prepared. He put new tennis balls in his walker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem&quot; with these debates &quot;is the candidates are convinced Americans don't want to hear the truth.&quot; For example, during the vice presidential debate, &quot;CNN gave little dials to focus groups.&quot; And when Sarah Palin &quot;mentioned the war, dials went down. Commentators said, 'Ooh, looks like Palin made a mistake. Focus group doesn't like hearing about the war.' Nobody likes hearing about the war! If you like hearing about the war, you're a psychopath. Or Dick Cheney. Whatever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the media lets candidates get too comfortable. 'Senator Obama, can I get you another latte?' 'Senator McCain, can I get you another hip replacement?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second presidential debate&quot; was &quot;tonight. And beforehand,&quot; John McCain &quot;said, 'The gloves are coming off.' ... Yeah, then McCain said, 'But don't worry, the diaper is staying on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the questions for tonight's debate were submitted by people on the Internet.&quot; When &quot;faced with the Internet questions, John McCain said he refuses to engage with wizards or warlocks. None of that crazy Internet magic for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent speech, Sarah Palin referred to Afghanistan as 'our neighboring country.' Yeah, yeah. Then she promised to find Osama bin Laden in the mountains of Toronto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a speech today about the economy. And he said he believed -- this is his quote -- he said, 'Anyone who makes bad decisions should fail.' ... Yeah, then Bush looked around the room and said, 'Hey, why did it get so quiet in here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the networks had their own spin on&quot; last night's debate last night &quot;between Barack Obama and John McCain. ... Like, ABC called it 'Dancing Around the Questions,'&quot; while &quot;MTV billed it as &quot;Ebony and History.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was broadcast live from Nashville. You know, I don't want too say the debate was boring. But I never thought a political event in Tennessee could be that dull without the help of Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess this time they went with the town hall format. ... They use that because they say it demonstrates the next president's ability to think and talk at the same time, or as President Bush calls that, 'showing off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It got a little heated at one point during the debate. McCain talked about experience and he said, 'We don't have time for on-the-job training.'&quot; Then why did &quot;you pick Sarah Palin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Barack Obama criticized John McCain for singing, 'Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.' Remember that? ... Ironically, now the number one song in Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the only really new proposal last night came from John McCain,&quot; who &quot;proposed buying up bad homeowner mortgages. Not to save the middle class. You know, McCain, he just likes buying houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has vowed to do only a few interviews between now and the election. Katie Couric's interview, she called it 'gotcha journalism.'&quot; Palin is not &quot;doing any more of those, just doing friendly interviews now, which she calls 'you betcha journalism.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you see a lot of these financial experts on the news the last couple of weeks. And isn't the very fact they're in this mess proof there's no such thing as a financial expert? Huh, huh?&quot; Anyway, the &quot;good news, Secretary Treasurer Henry Paulson called for calm today. ... The bad news, he made the call from the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, he understands people's anxieties. Understands their anxieties? He is their anxiety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs The Campaign Is Getting Ugly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Three times Straight Talk Express has 'accidentally' knocked over Obama's mailbox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Next debate will be moderated by Jerry Springer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. McCain keeps referring to opponent as Senator Barack Hussein Obama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Sarah Palin says she can see Joe Biden's hair plugs from her house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Desperate attempt to connect Obama to the last eight years of Regis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No number 5 ? economy so bad, write putting everything he owns up on eBay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. They have resorted to 'your Vice President's so dumb' jokes.. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Obama claimed McCain's irresponsibility caused the 1929 stock market crash ? he's that old, people!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even Dick Cheney thinks they're being cruel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Obama's gloves are off, McCain's teeth are out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch the debate last night? ... I gave up drinking a while ago, but I started again. And I'm watching the debate last night,&quot; and &quot;I did a shot every time McCain said, 'My friends.' And so I am just blotto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know, what did you think of the debate? Anything? Anything going on there? I'm not sure that John McCain actually helped himself. In fact, I think maybe he blew off the wrong show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kind of got a chuckle out of this. Tom Brokaw was the moderator&quot; of the debate, and at &quot;one point, Tom tells Obama and McCain that they're going to now answer questions that came in over the Internet. And you know what McCain said? 'Tom, is that the same as a telegraph?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they had the...town hall format, and that meant that the candidates could wander around on stage. You know, I like John McCain, but wandering around on stage there,&quot; he &quot;looked like a retiree who can't find his Buick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was not mentioned during the debate and did not watch the debate. I thought that was interesting. And they said, 'Well, Sarah, why ? I'm sorry, Miss Alaska -- why didn't you...watch the debate? And she said, 'Well, I'm busy reading every newspaper and magazine ever published.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then there was one kind of unpleasant moment for Barack Obama when that woman jumps up. Did you see that, where the woman jumps up? And Barack Obama is momentarily taken aback. And he said, 'All right, look, I told you, ma'am, I already have a running mate. Now please sit down, Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for Barack Obama. Most people say he won the debate last night. He's ahead in the polls. ... But...I would not count out McCain yet.&quot; It is like the tortoise and the hare. Obama is the hare, surging ahead with his ideas,&quot; while &quot;McCain is like the tortoise -- thousands of years old, shuffling forward, occasionally poking out of his shell to poop.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's debate, John McCain sparked a bit of a controversy...when he referred to Barack Obama as 'that one.' Yeah, afterwards,&quot; McCain &quot;said, 'What? Like I'm supposed to remember everybody's name now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, because of all the international focus on the election,&quot; last &quot;night's debate was broadcast in foreign countries all across Europe, Asia, and South America,&quot; or, &quot;as Sarah Palin calls them, Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People looking into Barack Obama's campaign contributions say that Obama may have received $3.3 million from abroad. Yeah. It turns out that broad is Oprah Winfrey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Possible controversy for the Obama campaign. Republicans are now accusing Barack Obama's campaign of voter fraud, because some of the people they've registered sound like they have fake names. ... Apparently, the fakest-sounding name is Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine says...that the winner of the presidential election in Florida will be determined by voters under the age of 30. ... In case you're wondering, the Florida voters under 30 are named Kyle and Stacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see all...the big Halloween stores opening up all across the country. ... Retailers say the big costume this year, pirate.&quot; All &quot;you need is a briefcase, Brooks Brothers suit, Wall Street business cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's still talking about the presidential debate the other night. How boring it was! Experts say neither candidate scored a knockout punch. But I don't know about that. I mean, after about ten minutes, I was out like a light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And McCain criticized Barack Obama for saying he would invade Pakistan to go after bin Laden. McCain said he would never telegraph his punches. Well, telegraph, maybe, email, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Obama says there is nothing to the accusations of a friendship with '60s radical Bill Ayers. He says Ayers is a person he knew early in his career but now plays no role in his campaign. You know, kind of like the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in describing her beautiful Alaskan home, Sarah Palin said that when she stands on her porch, she can see the moon. You know what that means? She is now qualified to be an astronaut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how many are worried about Iran's nuclear enrichment program? How many are worried about that? How many more worried about our CEO enrichment program?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week after Congress grilled those AIG executives after taking our $85 billion in bailout money and spending a half million of it at that fancy resort? Well, this week, they asked for and got another $37.5 billion. And earlier this week, they announced they're going on another retreat, this time with golf and massages at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel at Half Moon Bay here in California. You know, instead of a bailout, how about locking these guys up with no bail? Wouldn't that be better?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. Aren't we now ? didn't we buy this company? Don't we own it now? Huh? Why don't we all show up at the Ritz-Carlton next week? 'Hey, where's our massage?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; the economy is &quot;not looking good. Not looking good at all. I tell ya, I went to the bank to ask for a loan, the guy said, 'We were just going to ask you the same thing.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, today I saw Bill Maher praying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad now, pigs can no longer afford lipstick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is some good news. ... The price of oil has dropped from $145 a barrel to just $85 a barrel. The price has dropped almost in half. But don't worry, the oil companies will pass these savings on to you just as soon as hell freezes over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Google has now developed a new feature on Gmail that would force users to take an online sobriety test in order to send an email. ... It's supposed to prevent people from emailing drunk or sending something you would later regret. So, to log on, to you have answer five simple math questions. And if you can't do it, you're either drunk or you went to public school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'W' hits the theaters October, 17th.&quot; This is the &quot;movie about the Bush Administration. ... You know, the stock market's collapsed, houses are being foreclosed on, unemployment at an all time high.&quot; They should wait &quot;until Halloween&quot; and release &quot;it as a horror movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'National Enquirer,' Britney Spears' younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears is pregnant again.&quot; But, &quot;the good news is, Sarah Palin has named her an honorary Alaskan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day in New York City today,&quot; where it &quot;was 73 and sunny. John McCain, 73 and cranky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. He looks like a guy would you see wandering around Walgreens looking for the dye gel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain &quot;looks like the guy at Home Depot who mixes paint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are really getting nasty in the campaign. ... Listen to this. Today, John McCain tried to link Barack Obama to the Chicago Cubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...is saying that she doesn't know who Barack Obama really is. ... Well that's interesting because she also doesn't know who Sarkozy is, Gordon Brown, Kim Jong Il, Hugo Ch?vez, Vladimir Putin, Osama bin laden, the list goes on and on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the Bush Administration is taking over the banks. So, hey -- crisis over!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another sign that the economy is in bad shape. Earlier today, Vice President Cheney took his stockbroker hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader announced that he is opening up 22 campaign offices nationwide,&quot; which &quot;means that every Nader supporter will get his or her own office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on NBC, the fourth contestant was kicked off the show, 'The Biggest Loser.' ... Yeah, that leaves two contestants, the CEO of AIG and the CEO of Lehman Brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the African country of Liberia, police have discovered huge numbers of marijuana farms in a county named Bong. ... Yeah, police became suspicious when they realized the county's name was Bong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before lawmakers in Alaska released the report on this 'Troopergate' scandal, Sarah Palin's campaign released the results of their own campaign clearing her of any wrongdoing. ... I think it's legitimate. Because apparently, Palin can see the courthouse from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continues to be the economy. How many people remember when we had an economy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how bad the economy is getting -- I opened the business section today of the New York Times. It says, 'you don't want to know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group of 20 &quot;are going to get together and brainstorm. So I guess that pretty much leaves President Bush out of the picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Bill and Hillary Clinton this weekend, 33rd wedding anniversary. And you thought the Iraqi war was a never ending conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is celebrating 35 years of marriage to Bill, or as Hillary likes to call it, the 'bridge to nowhere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has purchased his own satellite TV station to run campaign commercials. Meanwhile, John McCain's VCR is still blinking 12:00.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post &quot;compared the 2008 presidential election to the 1932 presidential election. Mainly because 1932 was the first time that John McCain ran for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Columbus Day, which means all the banks are closed. At least I think that's why they're closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize that Columbus is the only person to have closed more banks than President Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they gave out the Nobel prize for economics. Why?!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe me, in this economy, there weren't many people to choose to give it to. You know who would up getting it? ... Gary Coleman for those CashCall commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The finance ministers of the world's top economies met in Washington for an emergency meeting on the banking crisis. ... While they were meeting, they gave President Bush some Monopoly money to play with so he'd feel involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Jimmy Carter blasted President Bush, blaming the financial crisis on him. Carter called this the 'worst financial crisis since the Carter Administration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news&quot; is that the &quot;stock market went up over 900 points today. ... This is the best thing to happen to the John McCain campaign since -- actually, it's the first good thing to happen&quot; to the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think President Bush really understands any of this stuff? Like today, he was asked about General Motors,&quot; and Bush &quot;said, 'I think he's doing a fine job in Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the average price of a gallon of gas has had its biggest drop ever this week.&quot; It is &quot;now down to $3.30 a gallon. ... Remember $3.30 a gallon? That's the price you used to get outraged about a year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad the economy is, today in Mexico, Mexicans were patching the hole in the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman at a John McCain rally said that Barack Obama is an Arab.&quot; But McCain &quot;quickly corrected her. It was really awkward because McCain had to tell her, 'Look, Governor Palin, you are wrong.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Optical shops have sold out of the sexy eyeglass frames that Sarah Palin wears,&quot; while &quot;women's clothing stores are sold out of the pretty dress that Michelle Obama's been wearing in these interviews. ... However, a plastic surgeon said today they still have a warehouse full of those Joe Biden-type hair plugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not been a good weekend for Governor Palin. In a 263-page report, Alaskan officials said she abused the powers of her office, and that was an ethics violation. Wow, she's only been on the national scene a month,&quot; and &quot;already she has an ethics violation. Who says she's not ready for Washington, huh?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Sarah Palin was booed at a Philadelphia Flyers hockey game. According to ABC News, the booing was so loud they cranked the music up to deafening levels to drown it out. And to make it even more awkward, once they cranked up the music,&quot; Palin's running mate, John McCain, &quot;started yelling, 'Turn that crap down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today, talking about being behind in the polls, John McCain said, 'My friends, we've got them just where we want them.' ... And he's not the first military man to say that. I believe General Custer also&quot; said it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill and Hillary Clinton celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary over the weekend. And some thought it wouldn't last. Ironically, it was Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand Bill planned a huge party. Then, unfortunately, Hillary found out about it, and of course that was the end of the whole&quot; thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they spent the day together pretending to support Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In The Sarah Palin &quot;Troopergate&quot; Investigation Report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Spent thousands of tax-payer dollars pimpin' her dog sled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Terminated her hairstylist after receiving a bad beehive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Palin claims she hasn't seen this kind of misuse of justice since Supreme Court case of... umm, lemme think of one here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In her adult life has never gone more than ten minutes without saying, 'You betcha!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. No number 6 -- writer looking for his hairbrush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Report's conclusion: 'Hey, at least she didn't shoot a guy like Cheney!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Spent 8 weeks in rehab for addiction to lip gloss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When asked to respond to charges said, 'Instead of answering your question, I'm going to talk about energy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Printed in extra-large font so McCain can read it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Palin's excuse: 'It wasn't me, it was Tina Fey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's Columbus Day,&quot; the &quot;day we celebrate Christopher Columbus discovering America, or as it is now known, 'a fixer-upper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of things on sale on Columbus Day. ... You can get a good deal on a dining room set, mattresses, General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, I think he said this in his weekly radio address, he said about the economic crisis, President Bush said, 'It's a good thing I'm in charge.' And I know that's what we're all thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush...says he's going to tweak the financial package. He's going to tweak the financial bailout. That's what he's doing now. He's tweaking that financial bailout. That's like the captain of the Titanic tweaking the brunch menu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush...is trying to reassure Americans that things are going to get better soon. And I was thinking well sure, in three months he'll be out of office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, over the weekend she went to Philadelphia and dropped the first puck for the beginning of the NHL season. And I thought well, I bet she probably needed a break, had to get away from reading every newspaper and magazine. Because...you don't even know how much time&quot; that takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;you can tell every now and then that&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;spends a lot of time in Alaska, because&quot; when after &quot;she dropped the first puck&quot; at the hockey game, she cut &quot;a hole in the ice and began to fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The third presidential debate is Wednesday night,&quot; and &quot;John McCain says he's going to win. ... Of course, he also told Custer the surge was working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Newsweek' magazine's being criticized because last week's cover featured a very unflattering picture of Sarah Palin. ... Palin says it's the worst thing the press has done to her since the time they made her answer a question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, the leaders of the world's richest countries got together to discuss the global economic meltdown. ... President Bush wanted to go to the meeting, but after last week the US is no longer one of the world's richest countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know what most people are going to be this Halloween? Broke!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the financial news is starting to look pretty good this week. Yesterday, the market was up almost 1,000 points. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say if you're in the stock market, you stay in it for the long haul. They say if you hold on to your stocks for ten years,&quot; they &quot;will go back up in value. It's kind of like being a Detroit Lions season ticket holder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they handed out the Nobel prize for economics yesterday. Sadly, the winner had to sell it on eBay to make his mortgage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a group of Nobel prize-winning scientists, because of the economic crisis, the planet might actually improve from the damage of global warming because we're using less fossil fuel and we're saving energy. See, this shows the brilliance of President Bush's plan. He was killing the economy, yeah, but to save the planet! The man is a genius!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the economy is starting to turn around. In fact today, instead of just shooting animals for food, Sarah Palin is shooting them for fun again.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the biggest newspaper in Alaska, 'The Anchorage Daily News,' says Sarah Palin's reaction to this Troopergate report, you know where she was found guilty, was 'either astoundingly ignorant or downright Orwellian,' to which Sarah Palin said, 'Do I have to pick one now or can I get back to you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday,&quot; at &quot;a rally in Virginia, they played the theme to 'Rocky' as John McCain walked out on stage.&quot; Does John McCain &quot;look like Rocky to you? Doesn't he look more like the Burgess Meredith character?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would McCain want to be like Rocky? ... Didn't Rocky get the hell kicked out of him by the black guy? Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last presidential debate is tomorrow night,&quot; and it &quot;is going to be sponsored in part by Anheuser-Busch.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more charges of voter registration fraud with this group ACORN. ... This is turning into a huge scandal. Apparently, this group has been charged with putting a lot of phony names on voter registration cards, including Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse was registered to vote in Florida. Is that so bad? I mean, Goofy's been President for the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Top Ten Ways John McCain Can Turn It Around:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Sizzling tango with Cloris Leachman on 'Dancing with the Stars.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This economy is crazy. Are you with me on that one? This is what I saw today. I saw a Lehman Brothers executive walking around town wearing a sign that read, 'Will work for a seven-figure bonus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House -- you know, George Bush is still our President for a couple of more months -- and yesterday down in Washington in the White House, he met with Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi,&quot; but &quot;Bush kept calling him Boy-R-Dee. It was awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russia apparently has test-fired long-range ballistic missiles. ... At least that's what Sarah Palin says she saw from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying that when Sarah Palin is speaking, she blinks her eyes. People believe that those are coded messages,&quot; and &quot;I'm a conspiracy nut. So I got a hold of a tape of a recent campaign appearance,&quot; and &quot;I slowed it down.&quot; And &quot;if you translate the blinks to Morse code, sure enough, right there it says, 'Vote for Grandpa.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what happened at a rally yesterday? Sarah Palin mistook some of her supporters for hecklers. You know, confusion happens in all walks of life. For example, a few weeks ago, John McCain mistook her for a legitimate candidate. It happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night is the final presidential debate,&quot; and &quot;John McCain is going to take this opportunity to unveil his new campaign persona, his new campaign personality, to really energize the last couple of weeks of the campaign: Fighting underdog. ... And if that doesn't work, then he's going to go to sadistic yard bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you one thing about John McCain, the guy is an optimist. He sees the glass as half full...of his teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's awful, isn't it? How about this? Barack Obama, what a guy.&quot; He is actually &quot;going door to door, knocking on doors in a neighborhood, asking people if they'll vote for him. Coincidentally, John McCain is also going door to door,&quot; except when he knocks on a door, he &quot;says, 'Do I live here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston,&quot; the &quot;boyfriend of Sarah Palin's pregnant daughter,&quot; is &quot;back in the news.&quot; He &quot;gave an interview&quot; in which he &quot;says that at first, he was nervous attending the Republican convention with the Palins, but then he was like, 'Whatever.' Yeah, he also admitted that he writes Sarah Palin's speeches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of politics, a group linked to Democrats is now being investigated because they've been accused of falsifying voter registration forms, including a form for Mickey Mouse. Yeah, President Bush was furious when he heard this, because he thought Mickey Mouse was a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced today he is going to have the Federal government put $250 billion into US banks. Yeah. Bush also said if he's putting that much money into a bank, they'd better give him a big-ass toaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week on the campaign trail, John McCain made some news. He talked about his next debate with Barack Obama, and he said, 'I'm going to whip his you-know-what.' ... Then, McCain vowed to 'hit Obama in the whatchamacallit' and 'kick him in the thingamajig.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new bank bailout today. The government is taking a $250 billion ownership stake in a bunch of failing banks, which is great news because at long last, banking will be as efficient as going to the DMV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man! The fire's, what, about five or six miles from the studio here.&quot; You know, in &quot;some areas of LA, the smoke was so thick&quot; today, &quot;you couldn't even see the smog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, people in Hollywood&quot; do not &quot;know how to deal with fires, especially celebrities,&quot; because &quot;when Hollywood celebrities see a burning bush, they rush towards it,&quot; thinking &quot;Barack Obama's about to speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tonight was the very last presidential debate. So you know what that means? Prayer does work.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this interesting. Hillary Clinton said, on Fox News, there's no chance of her running for president again...this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, an article in 'The Washington Post,' today&quot; said &quot;some medical experts believe Joe Biden may have had Botox. In fact, you know how they could tell? His expression didn't change when they asked him about his hair plugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Biden is &quot;not the only one&quot; under the medical experts' microscopes, because these same experts are now &quot;accusing John McCain of being pumped full of formaldehyde.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama unveiled his economic plan this week. Obama said the one word in everybody's mind, and that word is j-o-b-s. Immediately afterwards, President Bush accused Barack of talking in some kind of secret code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama continues to lead in the polls. Barack said today if it wasn't for Fox News, he might be up two or three more points in the polls. So apparently, five of the six news channels openly rooting for him isn't enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the market went down over 700 points today. Oh, that reminds me. You know, we turn our clocks back soon. We're turning it back to 1929, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they gave out the Nobel prize for economics this week.&quot; It &quot;went to a highly intelligent economist whose theory...is a little hard, I think, for the average person to comprehend. I'm going to break it down. He determined -- this is his theory -- he determined that it was bad business to give loans to people who can't pay them back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney was treated, today, for an irregular heartbeat. His doctors aren't sure what caused it. They figured it was either stress or the sudden drop in oil prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, doctors now say drinking alcohol shrinks your brain. ... Their proof -- the last eight years of the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, ladies and gentlemen, I got an update on Vice President Dick Cheney. He was admitted to a hospital earlier today&quot; for an &quot;abnormal heart rhythm. But he's doing fine. He's okay. He's already sitting up, sneering at nurses,&quot; and &quot;and he'll be out shooting hunting buddies again soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Senator Barack Obama? ... He's going door to door, knocking on doors,&quot; and &quot;I don't know if he changed any votes, but today he came home with a big bag of Halloween candy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was a little embarrassing when&quot; Obama rang the doorbell &quot;at two of McCain's houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The third presidential debate took place in our neck of the woods, out on Long Island. Topics they covered: Economy, foreign policy, and Billy Joel's ex-wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched the debate, and, honestly, there was no question...who looked more presidential. Bob Schieffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...they're going right down to the wire here. You have Barack Obama and you have John McCain. And...what a soap opera&quot; this &quot;has become. It's the 'Old &amp; The Restless.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you notice how energetic and aggressive John McCain was during the debate? I mean, I think somebody added Red Bull to his Mylanta.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every debate&quot; has &quot;an embarrassing moment&quot; where &quot;one of the candidates&quot; gets confused, and it &quot;happened again earlier tonight.&quot; The candidates were &quot;sitting at desks -- that was the new breakthrough, sitting at desks -- and John McCain kept asking about a senior discount on the Grand Slam Breakfast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What&quot; is &quot;exciting&quot; me now are &quot;all these twists and turns and nuances to campaign strategies. For example, tonight, John McCain unveiled his new campaign personality, his new campaign persona -- fighting underdog. ... Now, if that doesn't work, he's going to rogue cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work,&quot; McCain will try &quot;domineering stage mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work,&quot; McCain will go with &quot;deformed bell ringer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work,&quot; McCain will test out &quot;cavalry commander who breaks the treaty with Cochise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the Sarah Palin? Do you like Sarah Palin? She's exciting. She's interesting, isn't she?&quot; For example, at tonight's presidential debate, &quot;she was blinking McCain's answers in code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, the third presidential debate was held. ... Hillary Clinton was sitting in the audience. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah, in fact, when John McCain was attacking Barack Obama, you could hear Hillary yelling, 'Get him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin had her motorcade stop at a Wal-Mart so she could buy a bag of diapers. ... Palin said she wouldn't have made the stop for diapers, but John McCain's completely out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Josh Brolin, who plays President Bush in the new movie 'W,' says at first he wasn't sure he should take the role because it would be such an acting challenge. That's what he said. Brolin says he prepared for the role by getting up every day, running five miles, and then bashing himself in the head with a hammer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we had the final of three debates between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain at Hofstra University in New York. ... Obviously, McCain had a lot riding on this one. He's way behind in the polls and he doesn't have much time left. Ten years if he's lucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anheuser-Busch, the beer company, underwrote&quot; the debate. They &quot;paid for everything, which is a little...odd because Cindy McCain owns&quot; an &quot;Anheuser-Busch wholesaler in Arizona. ... I don't know much about running for president, but it seems to me that John McCain's not spending nearly enough time working 'the my wife can get us free beer angle.' Right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' I'm your host, Jay the Plumber.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you watched the debate last night, you know John McCain kept talking about this guy Senator Obama met on the campaign trail named Joe the Plumber. Do you know the saddest part about the Joe the Plumber story? Last month, he was an investment banker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Joe the Plumber has been all over the place. He's been on 'Good Morning America.'&quot; He was &quot;on Fox News. He was talking to the Associated Press. This plumber has done more interviews in one day than Sarah Palin has done since being chosen by John McCain.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...McCain kept talking about how he could help this man. ... You know, if McCain really wanted to help this guy, you know what you should do? Just have him re-pipe all of McCain's houses. That would be a job for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, here's the best story. I just got this from 'The New York Times.' Turns out Joe the Plumber, his name is not Joe and he is not a licensed plumber and he owes back taxes. So it sounds like he has the best plan to reduce taxes ? don't pay them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there were rumors going around that&quot; Joe the Plumber &quot;might be a plant. But today, President Bush said, 'No, no, no, he's human.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought&quot; last night's debate was the &quot;best...of the three&quot; so far. And the moderator, Bob Schieffer, &quot;did a great job. And of course McCain was thrilled. For once, he was not the oldest guy there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during the debate last night, they said no one made any big errors. Of course not, all the big errors were being made by the Dodgers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. A married congressman from Florida, Tim Mahoney, is under investigation for paying $125,000 to his mistress to keep her quiet. Well, that worked out well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen, yesterday it was reported&quot; that Mahoney &quot;was having a second affair at the same time. What kind of sleaze ball cheats on his mistress? That is gross!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a statement with his wife standing next to him,&quot; Mahoney &quot;said...the most important thing to him now is his wife. Well, that's got to make her feel special. Of all the women he's sleeping with, you're number one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the new movie of President Bush opens tomorrow. It is called 'W.'&quot; Apparently, &quot;they chose that title&quot; because &quot;'Body of Lies' was already taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to Winnie the Pooh,&quot; who is &quot;82 years old this week.&quot; And he is &quot;still sharp as a tack. In fact, earlier today, Winnie was registered to vote by ACORN in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Messages Left On Joe The Plumber's Answering Machine:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Hey, heard you mentioned in the debate. Now can you come over and get the hairball out of my drain?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Joe Six Pack calling; what are you trying to pull?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Sorry, wrong number. I was looking for Larry the Cable Guy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Dude -- did you get to meet Fannie Mae?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'This is Sarah Palin. Do you consider yourself a maverick plumber?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'You had a better night than Joe the Dodgers' manager.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'This is Bob Schieffer. Hijack one of my debates again and I'll bust your kneecaps with a pipe wrench.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Joe, you gotta get a copy of this Late Show Fun Facts book -- it's hilarious!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'It's Brian from the Late Show. Are you available tonight if McCain cancels?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'It's Madonna. Are you seeing anybody?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you folks are here on a great night and I will tell you why. The entire balcony is filled with state troopers fired by Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, I'm your host of the program. I'm Dave the plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess I don't need to tell you folks that...Senator John McCain is our guest tonight. Yeah, maybe I won't show.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the debate last night out there on Long Island. ... I want to tell you, it was a different John McCain, wasn't it? He was electric. He electrified the crowd. And afterwards, Cloris Leachman tossed him her hotel key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first debate was podiums. ... Then he had they had the town hall format,&quot; and &quot;last night it was desks.&quot; At the &quot;next debate, competitive eating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; there was &quot;lots of talk in the debate last night about Joe the Plumber. ... Do you remember him from the '60s Drano commercials? And I think he's also the one who ordered the hit on Sammy the Bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe the Plumber is such a celebrity now that after the debate he was rushed to Washington to unclog a valve on Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in New York City has Joe the Plumber fever? ... I mean, even the Statue of Liberty was holding a plunger, honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we were going to have Joe the Plumber on the program. We had him booked on the show, but at the last minute, he cancelled on to us do an interview with Katie Couric. So we don't...know what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was interesting last night during the debate. At one point, John McCain brings up Barack Obama's relationship with '60s radical William Ayers. And then Barack Obama brings up McCain's relationship with John Brown at Harper's Ferry. I thought -- wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was at the debate last night? Hillary Clinton.&quot; But &quot;I am thinking to myself, is it a really good idea to be leaving Bill home alone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A poll came out today; 67% of Americans say they've seen enough and they don't want any more presidential debates. ... The other 33% are plumbers who want to hear their name on television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about Joe the Plumber now. John McCain mentioned Joe the plumber last night 21 times. ... Experts are already comparing it to the 2004 debate when President Bush wouldn't shut up about Larry the Cable Guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more details coming out about Joe the Plumber.&quot; And &quot;I'm not making this up. It came out this morning. His real name is not Joe, and he's not a licensed plumber. ... However, the McCain campaign insists that the 'the' is accurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's debate, Hillary Clinton watched from the audience of Hofstra University's auditorium. ... Bill Clinton was also at Hofstra University, but he watched&quot; the debate &quot;from the Delta Gamma sorority house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain got some good news today. 'The Charleston Daily Mail' endorsed McCain, saying since he'll only be a one-term president, he can do the right thing to make tough decisions. When they told McCain they were only giving him four years, he said, 'That's great. My doctor only gave me two.' So, he's thrilled.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you...buying this whole Joe the plumber thing? McCain said he's worried about Joe the plumber's income. His income? Anybody here ever gotten a bill from a plumber and gone, 'Well, this is way too low.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, Joe the plumber, not his real name. Actually, his full name, Joe Hussein the plumber, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, all this media attention is going to his head. In fact,&quot; he &quot;now wants to be known as the plumber formerly known as Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Bush announced a $250 billion...plan for the government to directly buy shares of the nation's leading banks to make sure they're run properly. They're going to make sure they're run properly, yeah. Because one thing we know is that the people who gave us a $9 trillion debt, they know how to handle money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell most of these banks have gotten their bailout money already. I went by my bank today. It had a big sign: 'Now making toxic loans again. Come on down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House announced this week that we have killed the number two man in Al Qaeda. Now, I'm no military expert, but haven't we already killed the number two guy in Al Qaeda, like, 20 times? How many number two men are there? You know, call me when you get the number one guy. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney had to cancel an appearance this week after his doctor discovered his heart had an irregular rhythm. Well, the first clue that Cheney's heart was irregular, it was beating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was a four-hour procedure. ... Well, the first two hours was just waiting for the heart to thaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. Gold's Gym says that President Bush is the fittest president in modern history. No, he's very fit. I mean, not fit to be president. I mean workout, workout fit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this on the news? A bear jumped a 45-year-old hiker, who managed to grab a stick and beat the bear to death.&quot; The hiker &quot;then walked miles to the hospital. Boy, that Sarah Palin is unbelievable!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, Sarah Palin will be on 'Saturday Night Live.' When they told her, she said, 'What night is that on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the movie 'W' about George Bush opened today. Also opening this weekend, 'Sex Drive,' about Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain was on the program last night. And I don't know about this. He kept referring to me as 'that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe you saw the debate on Wednesday night,&quot; where &quot;McCain unveiled his new personality. He has a new personality. The new personality is fighting underdog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work, the next one is going to be tyrannical sea captain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work, fun loving gaucho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't work, expatriate saloon owner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't&quot; work, &quot;debonair riverboat gambler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't&quot; work, &quot;cruise ship gigolo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't&quot; work, &quot;heartless press agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if that doesn't&quot; work, &quot;randy stable boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the new Oliver Stone motion picture&quot; that &quot;opened today, 'W.'? Yes, and I want to tell you something. If there is one thing I can't get enough of, it's the Bush family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm proud to say that I'm actually in 'W.' .. I play the guy who gets peppered with shotgun by Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know when you have a movie like that about a guy who is alive, you wonder if they took some liberties with the truth. In one scene, I don't know if this is accurate or not, President Bush is seen actually reading a national security memo. And I thought, now, is that -- I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then actor Josh Brolin said it was tough going before cameras and pretending to be a president and -- no, wait a minute. That was Bush. Bush...said that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech earlier this week, John McCain...said, 'I've been fighting for the United States of America since I was 17 years old.'&quot; Then &quot;he said, 'Of course, back then it was called Pangaea.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin remains very popular.&quot; In &quot;fact, this week in Tennessee, a man named his newborn baby after Sarah Palin. Yeah,&quot; he decided to do so &quot;after he asked&quot; the baby &quot;to name three countries, and it just stared blankly into space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In less than three weeks, we will elect a new President of the United States. I am going to go out on a limb. I predict it will be either John McCain or Barack Obama or maybe two of the Jonas Brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some new developments today regarding Joe the plumber,&quot; the &quot;guy from Ohio who asked Barack Obama why he wanted to raise taxes on the plumbing business he wants to buy.&quot; It &quot;turns out that Joe is not a licensed plumber, he had to admit that he's not even close to buying the plumbing business, the business does not bring in between $250,000 and $280,000 a year like he said, and his name isn't even Joe; it's Sam.&quot; So &quot;the only thing true about Joe the plumber is the the.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin&quot; has &quot;been the butt of a lot of jokes and...the subject of a lot of criticism. In fact, she said at a rally in North Carolina yesterday that to avoid getting depressed, her staff now limits her access exclusively to the mainstream media. That's a good idea. Just what she needs, to read less.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember John Kerry? ... He ran for president and didn't do that well. He's being criticized for telling a joke about John McCain wearing adult diapers. How dare you, sir! That's my job! Knock it off, Kerry! I'll tell the McCain diaper jokes; you stick with losing elections to the least popular president ever in the history of America.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;November 4th is two weeks from today,&quot; but &quot;7% of people are still undecided. ... I just don't know how anyone could be undecided,&quot; because the &quot;choice in this election's black and white, literally!&quot; Young &quot;black guy, old white guy. There! Take your pick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both...campaigns are spending a lot of money to reach the undecided voters. Obama is buying half an hour of prime time on CBS.&quot; America &quot;loves CBS, of course, because...we're the number one choice&quot; of &quot;confused people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And McCain's buying time on Fox. And he was trying to make it like a Fox show, you know, like, 'When Obamas Attack,' or something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what&quot; McCain &quot;should do? He should do a guest appearance on 'Lost.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is taking time &quot;off from campaigning to visit his sick grandmother in Hawaii. Normally, it would be a bad idea to take time off two weeks before&quot; the presidential election. But &quot;at this point,&quot; Obama is &quot;far enough ahead that the only thing really that can stop his campaign is if he finds a mysterious bad luck Tiki doll on the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin had a good thought. She suggested that while Barack Obama is over in Hawaii, it might be a good idea for him to keep an eye on Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think that visiting his sick grandma might actually help&quot; Obama &quot;win more of the elderly vote. In fact, to try to counter that today, John McCain stopped by our nations' capitol to visit his grandmother, Susan B. Anthony McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wasn't such a great day for John McCain,&quot; who &quot;got some support today&quot; from an unwanted group. Al Qaeda &quot;picked him as their choice&quot; for president. Al Qaeda &quot;made this announcement on their website, which begs the question, al Qaeda has a website? Can't we use it to find them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this election, Obama is so far ahead now it seems the only way he can lose is if his supporters screw it up. But...Obama's supporters have a secret weakness. They're Democrats. They are perfectly capable of screwing this up. I'm not sure&quot; if &quot;Democrats remember how to win an election. They haven't won an election since 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Democrats better watch out,&quot; because the &quot;Republicans are going to pull out all the stops. Did you see they spent $150,000 on Sarah Palin's wardrobe?&quot; Boy, nothing &quot;says hockey mom like dropping six figures on bling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin's &quot;defense was&quot; that &quot; $150,000 doesn't go far when you're a female political candidate, and that's true. Last year, Hillary Clinton spent twice that much on suits at Men's Warehouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign says they needed to make Sarah Palin seem hip and cool,&quot; but &quot;I'm thinking if you're going to spend money trying to make somebody look hip and cool, what about John? What about spending some money on John?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miss Teen Louisiana Lindsey Evans has been stripped of her title after being arrested for dining and dashing at a restaurant.&quot; Allegedly, Lindsey &quot;and three friends ran out&quot; of a Louisiana &quot;restaurant without paying the...bill. Unfortunately for them,&quot; Lindsey &quot;left her purse behind with her driver's license and marijuana in it. So, police went to her house and arrested her.&quot; But did &quot;anyone ever consider the possibility that maybe a handbag of marijuana was her way of paying the check?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is taking heat today because the Republican National Committee has so far spent $150,000 on wardrobe for her and her family.&quot; Boy, Palin sure is &quot;representing small town hockey moms, isn't she folks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also yesterday,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;told a bunch of third graders that the vice president 'runs the Senate,' which the vice president does not do. That's a major -- not knowing what the job is. I mean, even President Bush will tell you the vice president doesn't run the Senate. The vice president runs the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I want to say...congratulations to the nation of India today. They've joined a very select group that has successfully launched a space mission. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody,&quot; but not &quot;a great day for Sarah Palin. Again! Today, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that's she's not ready to be president. And he's a Republican! He's like their super killer robot!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, was in Washington today. And he said that the current financial crisis is a 'one in a century' occurrence.&quot; And John McCain &quot;was like, 'He's right. I've been through three of 'em.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With less than two weeks to go before&quot; the presidential election, John McCain is &quot;behind Barack Obama in every major poll. But here's the important thing to remember: Back in 1984, with the same amount of time remaining, Walter Mondale was 14 points behind Ronald Reagan and then by the time the election came, he went on to lose every state except Minnesota. So -- all right, well, maybe that's a bad example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And truth be told, John McCain s doing pretty darn well for a guy who passed away 20 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As popular as Obama is here in the United States, he might be even more popular overseas. Gallup polled citizens of 70 countries and found that foreigners supported Obama over McCain by nearly four to one. It was an unusual poll, actually: 30% supported Obama, 8% supported McCain, and the rest supported David Hasselhoff. I guess that drunken hamburger video still hasn't hurt him abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard the Republican National Committee spent $150,000 in campaign donations for clothes and makeup for&quot; Sarah Palin. They &quot;have been taking a lot of heat for it. Today, John McCain even had to announce that when the election is over, the clothes will all be donated to charity. Finally, his plan to get her naked is bearing fruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's good news for Palin and McCain today. They got two big endorsements from Heidi and Spencer of 'The Hills.'&quot; All the ticket needs now are &quot;the Al Reynolds and John Mark Carr endorsements and they'll have it wrapped up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the news this week, CBS News' Katie Couric asked both presidential candidates&quot; when was &quot;the last time they cried. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in 'People' magazine,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;talks about the plans for her daughter's wedding. You know, Bristol's getting married. And Sarah says it's very difficult to find a dress that doesn't clash with the shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;is not letting all this criticism of her get her down. She said she's putting the election 'in God's hands,' which is good news for the Democrats because they think Barack Obama is God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harrison Ford topped an online poll of the best fictional presidents. Second place: George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy has become the central issue in&quot; the &quot;presidential campaign. I personally...haven't heard one word about fencing in the Mexicans in months, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And each candidate is claiming he's better equipped to handle this...than the other one. John McCain has for some reason decided to build his final push around Joe the plumber. Now, this guy Joe, we learned last week, is not a licensed plumber and his name isn't even Joe, but that didn't stop the McCain campaign from naming him, like, their artificial mascot. Why they would name a plumber a mascot for a campaign that's...gone down the toilet already, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nationally, the Republican ticket trails in every major poll, and some by as many as ten points, so the McCain campaign is now focusing on a last ditch strategy that involves three major parts. Number one: strengthen the support in the states that Bush won in 2004. Number two: flip Pennsylvania back from blue to red. And third, pray for an earthquake that will dump California into the Pacific Ocean. So if all those things happen, he's got a pretty good shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; McCain's &quot;running mate, Sarah Palin, said in Washington, DC, yesterday that the election is 'in God's hands' now. Isn't that what you say to a prisoner who's about to be executed?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it's hard to believe. Just one week left to go&quot; before the presidential &quot;election. It's amazing, isn't it?&quot; Do &quot;you realize that when this whole thing started, John McCain was just 47 years old?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, Colin Powell has endorsed Barack Obama for president, which is bad news for John McCain because at his age, he has enough colon problems.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, political pundits say Colin Powell is the biggest political figure to endorse Barack Obama since Bill and Hillary,&quot; and &quot;the only one of those three that will actually vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And out on the campaign trail this week,&quot; John McCain &quot;said that Barack Obama is already 'measuring the drapes' in White House.&quot; But &quot;I understand Sarah Palin is already driving McCain around to look at assisted living facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of interesting. With Halloween coming this weekend, they say not one person in the country is planning to dress up as Governor Sarah Palin. You know why? The costume costs $150,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about this. It was disclosed that the Republican Party spent $150,000 on clothes and makeup for Sarah Palin to try and make her look better. Why? She looks fine, doesn't she? Wouldn't they be better off spending that money trying to make McCain look a little bit better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday in Florida, Elisabeth Hasselbeck of 'The View'...appeared onstage with Sarah Palin. She's a big supporter. Elisabeth's speech was interrupted by hecklers...who police later identified as Whoopi, Barbara, and Joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the longest serving Republican senator, Alaska's Ted Stevens, found guilty just a few hours ago on all charges in his corruption trial. ... Do you know this story? He failed to report he had some work done on his house,&quot; but &quot;here's the bad part. You know who did the work? Joe the plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stevens is 84 years old. He could get three weeks or life, whichever comes first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after his big speech in North Carolina today, Senator Joe Biden said he was experiencing a sore throat, lost his voice. ... Boy, the good news doesn't stop for Barack Obama. Just one lucky break after another. It's unbelievable!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ralph Nader, God bless him, still out there campaigning. Ralph Nader said today he has set a record for the most campaign speeches given in one day. He gave 21 speeches in one day. Of course, we have to take his word for it, because...there are no witnesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big international news. Iranian President 'I'm a nut job' -- how do you say his name? Mahmoud Ahmadinejad?&quot; Well, he has &quot;taken ill. Oh, no. Does not look good. Does not look good. Yeah, he is expected to make a full recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, but some good economic news. The average price of gas, now $2.85...a gallon. ... The bad news? That's also the average value of your 401(k).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot; $2.85 a gallon&quot; is &quot;pretty good,&quot; because now &quot;you can afford to drive past the bank that foreclosed on your house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;the economy's looking bad,&quot; so bad that &quot;Joe the plumber got a second job as an electrician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the movie 'W,'&quot; about George W. Bush, is &quot;not doing well at the box office. ... In fact, after two weeks in the theater, it is now a trillion dollars in debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten n Sarah Palin Excuses For Spending $150,000 On Clothes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Need to look good for the Russians who can see me in Alaska.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'The old man spends more on Polident.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Auditioning to be Paris Hilton's BFF.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Wanted to impress the American voters in the evening gown competition.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Maverick, Joe the plumber, maverick, maverick, William Ayers, you betcha!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'I fell for the liberal retailers' gotcha sales tactics.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Because the dollar is so weak, it's really like I only spent $50,000.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Hmm...excuses? I'll find some and I'll get right back to ya!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'In addition to every newspaper and magazine, I also read every catalog.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'The difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull: lipstick, Prada shoes, a Gucci handbag, and a few $3,000 suits.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin spent $150,000 on clothes,&quot; but she has &quot;an even higher tab at LensCrafters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't get me wrong. Sarah Plain is a very frugal woman. In Alaska, she makes all of her clothes out of pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin doesn't shop at low-end stores. ... As a matter of fact, she thinks Old Navy is John McCain's nickname.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin&quot; spent &quot;yesterday campaigning with Elisabeth Hasselbeck from 'The View.'&quot; John McCain, meanwhile, &quot;spent yesterday looking for his slippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say that McCain insiders...are calling&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;an out of touch diva.&quot; They say Palin &quot;has a quick temper&quot; and &quot;ignores her staff. It's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &quot;is...rumored to be ill. And he's in the hospital today.&quot; His &quot;condition has been downgraded from serious to ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say Ahmadinejad is exhausted from overwork. And you know, thank God that will never happen to George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton turned 61...yesterday. How about that?&quot; Hillary and Bill &quot;shared a quiet birthday dinner, followed by a quiet breakfast, followed by a quiet lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if you want to get Hillary a gift, you can't go wrong with a gift certificate from Bed, Bath and Bitterness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in the 'Anchorage Daily News,' Alaska's largest newspaper, endorsed Barack Obama. ... That's another newspaper Sarah Palin will never read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, political experts say that John McCain's only chance of winning&quot; the presidential election &quot;next week is to attract swing voters. ... Unfortunately, McCain thinks swing voters are people who listen to Glenn Miller.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, a guy who played a game of basketball against Barack Obama said that Obama spent the whole game trash talking. ... He also said Obama's trash talking is 'eloquent, high-minded, and inspirational.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska's largest newspaper has endorsed Barack Obama despite the fact that their governor is Sarah Palin. ... Luckily for Palin, it's one of the 500 newspapers she doesn't read.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just one more week&quot; to go before the presidential election. But &quot;a large percentage of voters have already voted using early voting, which is smart for older voters in Florida who aren't sure they'll still be alive by next Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All getting ready for Halloween, yeah? Well, you know, the...good news, I guess,&quot; is that &quot;with the economy&quot; being &quot;so bad, people don't have to work so hard to make their houses look scary. I mean, the lights are out, the windows are boarded up; the lawn's not cut. Ooh, ooh! Every day is Halloween in America now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And financial experts say the economic crisis&quot; has cost the world &quot; $2.8 trillion. ... You know, it's hard for people to visualize how much a trillion dollars&quot; is, so let &quot;me put that in terms you understand: $2.8 trillion&quot; is &quot;enough money to buy Sarah Palin clothes for a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess Sarah Palin made three campaign stops today: Saks, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess there seems to be trouble brewing between...Sarah Palin and John McCain.&quot; McCain &quot;aides say that...Palin is 'going rogue' and not taking advice or notes from the McCain campaign. ... They say it's hard to keep her from going off script and making statements that hurt the campaign. In fact, it's gotten so bad, her Secret Service code name now? Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, that's the big story. They say Sarah Palin has stopped taking advice from McCain and is only looking out for herself. But does that surprise anybody here in Los Angeles? I mean, that happens all the time out here. Come on. Old guy pulls a hot chick out of obscurity, buys her a lot of expensive clothes, introduces her to a lot of famous people, she gets bored, stabs him in the back; moves on. Happens every day...in Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin told a crowd yesterday&quot; that when she is &quot;campaigning, she doesn't wear her wedding ring because the shape of it hurts her finger when she's shaking a lot of hands. And Bill said to Hillary, 'See! See I told ya ? that's why! See, I'm not the only one!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news for John McCain&quot; is that new &quot;polls in key battleground states show him with a comfortable lead over [clears throat] Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Joe Biden...lost his voice on the campaign trail yesterday. Turns out a hair plug stuck in his throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Alaskan Republican Senator Ted Stevens has been found guilty on all counts of taking over $250,000 worth of goods and services from a contractor to do some work on his house. And of course, Stevens still doesn't get it. Like, today, he said if he goes to prison, could he get a bay window put in? He knows a guy who could do it fairly easily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know the saddest thing about this whole Senator Stevens thing? He's an 84-year-old white guy. If this hadn't happened, he probably would have been the Republican nominee in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the US Department of Transportation, Americans drove 15 billion fewer miles in August&quot; than they did in the same month last year, to &quot;which President Bush said, 'See, that's one of the advantages of not having a job to go to.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drug Enforcement agents in New York City report that because the price of cocaine is skyrocketing, more and more people are buying cheap, bathtub-cooked crystal meth from disreputable sources. So please, whatever you do, make sure you only buy from a licensed crystal meth dealer. Do not be fooled by these discount fly-by-night operations. Remember, if it doesn't say Barstow, it's not crystal meth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, women are more pessimistic...about the economy recovering than men. ... Do you know why? Because men are in charge of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 1929,&quot; the &quot;stock market plunged 13%. ... Boy, those were the good old days, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska Senator Ted Stevens&quot; has &quot;been convicted on seven counts of fraud&quot; and &quot;corruption,&quot; but &quot;Republicans are relieved because at least&quot; the story &quot;didn't involve an airport men's room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaskan authorities were tipped off&quot; to Steven's activities &quot;by Russians who'd been watching with binoculars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One week from today,&quot; the presidential election will be held. As &quot;a matter of fact, earlier this morning down in Florida, they unloaded the crooked voting machine, so they're in mid-season form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we have the elections next week and then the winner of that election meets Hillary in the finals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's how it works. Election is Tuesday,&quot; and &quot;then Wednesday is the first day of Sarah Palin's 2012 campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain staffers are saying that Sarah Palin has turned into a diva&quot; and is &quot;making diva demands. Here's what they're talking about. A couple of days ago, LensCrafters...had to stay open after hours so Sarah could shop alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;hit a speechwriter with her cell phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. I just got my 2009 Sarah Palin calendar,&quot; which has &quot;exciting, sexy photos of Sarah Palin. In one of them, I think it's February, she is holding a soapy sponge, scrubbing a moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, hey, hey! Hey, please, settle down. You'll frighten&quot; Regis Philbin, who &quot;is on the show tonight. ... You know Regis, right?&quot; Regis is &quot;the old cranky guy with the hot babe who is not running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, Barack Obama is buying a half-hour commercial on CBS, NBC, and Fox. Not on ABC, though, I think because they've got 'Dancing with the Stars.' That's where viewers can watch an elderly person make a fool&quot; of himself or herself &quot;and then get voted out of the competition, which will be completely different from the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who is having a bad day? Ted Stevens, the Alaska senator. Today was his first full day as a felon. Yesterday, he was convicted on seven counts of corruption. ... Ted Stevens is 84 years old, which, you know, makes him what John McCain calls a 'whippersnapper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe the plumber back in the news. Earlier today, Joe the plumber officially endorsed John McCain. ... However, Joe insists that his first love will always be toilets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are warning voters right now that if Barack Obama is elected president the Democrats will control all three branches of the government. ... John McCain said, 'This would be dangerous,'&quot; while &quot;Dick Cheney said, 'It would be expensive.'&quot; Sarah Palin, meanwhile, said, 'We have three branches of government?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough news for John McCain.&quot; He is &quot;still trailing in the polls with just a week to go. CNN reported just a few hours ago that the polls in Pennsylvania show little movement for John McCain. At this point, the only way for McCain to show movement involves eating a bowl of Raisin Bran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is now encouraging his supporters to take Election Day off so they can help him get out the vote.&quot; But a &quot;lot of Americans said they were already planning to take that day off 'because they don't have a job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just six days from today, we'll know for sure exactly which candidate will be suing the other for voter fraud. This is exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, Barack Obama's 30-minute infomercial appeared on three of the major networks -- Fox, CBS and NBC. And, of course, NBC was thrilled to be considered a major network. Oh, we haven't had that in years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you didn't see it, one part was a little odd. At the end, Barack said, 'If you vote now, we'll throw in a set of steak knives and a can of OxiClean.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, this Barack Obama appearance was historic for our network. Did you know this? This is the first time a black man has appeared on NBC in primetime since Bill Cosby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while CBS, NBC and Fox were showing the Barack Obama ad,&quot; ABC &quot;was showing 'Pushing Daisies,' which I believe is the name of the McCain ad, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1846 that the Donner Party left for California. You know what happened there. Everything went wrong. They wound up eating each other, kind of like what's going on in the McCain campaign right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; even though &quot;the press continues to say there are problems between John McCain and Sarah Palin, today Palin denied there was any dissension.&quot; And &quot;she said she has also agreed to keep him on the ticket, so I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, though,&quot; things are &quot;not looking good for McCain. ... In fact, today he went down to IKEA because I think he realized this could be his only chance to put together his own cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska's Senator Ted Stevens&quot; has been &quot;found guilty on all seven felony counts of accepting...over $250,000 worth of gifts and services from a contractor. But he says he will not step down and he will win re-election. Don't you love how these guys have no shame? In fact, have you heard his new slogan, 'Vote for Stevens, a man of convictions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Massachusetts Democratic state senator named Dianne Wilkerson has been arrested for accepting $23,000 in bribes. She was going to use the money for her re-election campaign. And the FBI has actual pictures of her stuffing the $23,000 in her bra. ... Talk about putting together a campaign war chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; is &quot;preparing to leave the White House. That's a big job after eight years, of course. On the bright side, not a lot of books to pack up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They...say that there may be some friction between John McCain and Sarah Palin.&quot; Staffers &quot;suspected that there was something wrong when McCain started referring to Sarah Palin as 'that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what happened. They say that recently, on a campaign bus trip, John McCain actually snubbed Sarah Palin.&quot; But &quot;to be fair&quot; to McCain, Palin &quot;was busy...shooting squirrels&quot; outside the bus's rear window at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like John McCain and Sarah Palin together? It's fun to see them. Yeah.&quot; They &quot;remind me of a couple of cruise ship grifters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain looks like the old guy taking his secretary to Las Vegas, doesn't he, a little bit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Barack Obama had a half-hour television special,&quot; which cost &quot;a lot of money.&quot; In fact, &quot;they say it was the most money spent by a Democrat for a half an hour since Eliot Spitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cloris Leachman&quot; was &quot;voted off 'Dancing with the Stars' last night. I know! It seems America can't wait until Election Day to vote against a senior citizen. They had to do it last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Barack Obama hit back at the charges that he's a socialist by joking that since he shared his toys as a child, he must be a communist,&quot; to &quot;which John McCain responded, 'You had toys as a child? I had to play with dinosaurs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in Washington,&quot; the Secret Service &quot;arrested a man who climbed over the White House fence. True story, yeah. Yeah, the Secret Service told the man, 'Get back here, Mr. President. You have two more months.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the speech earlier today, Barack Obama accidentally mixed up his black sitcom characters. He said that Wheezy from 'The Jeffersons' was a character on 'Sanford and Son.' ... And just like that, folks, the election is wide open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three major television networks -- CBS, NBC, and Fox, along with MSNBC, Univision, TV1, and BET -- joined together tonight to take Barack Obama's money from him. They all aired a half-hour long infomercial that was paid for by his campaign. ... Most people thought that Obama would use the time to...ask American for their vote,&quot; but he went in &quot;a completely different direction&quot; by &quot;saying 'I'm the President, and if you don't like it, you can suck it, America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I watched 'American Idol' last night, the Barack Obama show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all see Barack Obama's infomercial? It was called 'American Stories.' You know why they called it 'American Stories'? I guess it sounded better than 'Barack Obama Running Out the Clock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The show was very well done. I got to admit, I especially liked the end, where Barack rose to the heavens on a cloud. Wasn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the amazing part -- this is true -- it was the highest rated show on NBC last night. NBC's already talking to Barack about picking it up for 13 more episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after Barack Obama, I watched John McCain's ad on TV.&quot; Well, &quot;I thought it was McCain's ad,&quot; but it turned &quot;out it was just Wilford Brimley for Liberty Medical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John McCain campaigned in the Ohio town of Defiance. Next comes Anger, then, finally, Acceptance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week out on the campaign trail, John McCain called Barack Obama a socialist,&quot; but &quot;President Bush defended Barack Obama. But see, again, I don't think President Bush really understands. Like, he told McCain, he said, 'When you're President, you get a lot of visitors to the White House. You have to be a good socialist. It's good manners.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders of the McCain campaign say that Sarah Palin has gone rogue. Republicans are complaining that she's not listening to their advice, she's not taking their notes, and she's going off on her own and saying whatever she wants. And then when the campaign is asked what they like best about her, 'She's a maverick!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans now say that the $150,000 worth of clothes they bought for Sarah Palin will probably go to a charity. Charity, is that a good idea? Isn't that kind of counterproductive? I mean, are you going to give a homeless woman your spare change when she's wearing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket and Jimmy Choo shoes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Democratic state senator from Massachusetts named Dianne Wilkerson has been arrested after being caught on surveillance tape taking thousands of dollars in bribe money from an undercover agent; $23,000 in cash, stuffing it in her bra. ... Of course, both parties are outraged. Republicans can't believe she defiled money with her breasts, and of course Democrats can't believe she defiled her breasts with money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little cold and windy outside, isn't it today? ... It's so cold today that Sarah Palin was putting ChapStick on a pit bull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain was on&quot; Larry King's show last night, and it got &quot;kind of awkward&quot; when &quot;Larry had to tell John McCain that 72% of his ex-wives were for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; on that show, Larry King and John McCain &quot;looked like two guys who would be fighting over Cloris Leachman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And have you seen Sarah Palin and John McCain. I mean if you look at them, it's kind of interesting. He looks like the elderly husband who would have her followed by a private detective. A little bit, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...here's what I like about John McCain. He's an optimist. ... Always sees the glass as half full...of his teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about last night,&quot; when Barack Obama had his &quot;half hour infomercial TV special. I mean, thank God! It's about time this guy got some media coverage, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...I thought it was one of those heartwarming infomercials. It had a wonderful ending. In the final scene Barack Obama is adopted by Angelina Jolie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...did you hear what happened down in Washington, DC, earlier today?&quot; Guards &quot;had to wrestle and apprehend an intruder who was trying to jump over the White House fence. Nice try, Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain introduced&quot; Joe the plumber during a campaign appearance in Ohio today, but Joe was not there. In &quot;Joe's defense, like every plumber, he said he could only be there sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone of course talking about the Barack Obama special on TV last night. But John McCain&quot; was also on TV. He &quot;went to 'Larry King Live.' John McCain and Larry King. Not since Godzilla battled Mothra has there been so mighty a clash of the dinosaurs!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry King didn't let McCain off easy though. He asked hard-hitting questions,&quot; like &quot;Which is better, corned beef or pastrami?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations, Phillies,&quot; winners of the World Series. A team &quot;that's been around 125 years defeated a group of young upstarts. Maybe there's hope for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The World Series got a raw deal this year. It wasn't talked about as much as usual because everyone is talking about Barack Obama, except for late night comedians. We're all talking about John McCain. That's because he can't hear us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what you think of Obama, you have to admit his show was very well made. I mean, from a technical standpoint,&quot; which &quot;begs the question, how can I get a show like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama special was really just an infomercial. I actually expected them to say, 'We can make this a better country for just three easy payments of $19.95.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've noticed a number of athletes are now endorsing candidates in this presidential election. ... Barack Obama has been endorsed by Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley, and John McCain's been endorsed by Ty Cobb and Jim Thorpe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe the plumber was supposed to appear at a John McCain rally today, but didn't show up. Yeah. So, apparently, the guy really is a plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge in Ohio has ruled that homeless people are allowed to vote, and they can list their home address as a park bench. Yeah. Ohio officials say that a park bench may not be the most traditional place to live, but it's still a lot nicer than Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign &quot;thought Joe the plumber was going to be&quot; at a McCain appearance &quot;in Defiance, Ohio. They thought Joe the plumber was going to be there. Joe told the news that they asked him to come and then nobody followed up, so he didn't go. That's surprising. It's not like a plumber to keep you waiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama &quot;is ahead in nearly every major poll. One gambling site online has him as a seven to one favorite to win. They're saying the only way Obama lose this election right now is if they made him bowl for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news today for the economy, finally. Exxon Mobil announced that they made the biggest profit of any company ever. They made $14.83 billion, up 58% from the same quarter lat year. They broke their own record by more than $3 billion.&quot; You &quot;know what? Next time you're at the gas station, please, steal a squeegee. They owe it to you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of California,&quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a Republican, but &quot;he broke with his party today by announcing that he opposes Proposition 8,&quot; a &quot;proposition in California that would ban gay marriage. ... Arnold also...opposes Proposition 14, which would require all governors of California to speak some English.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had two kids come by for Halloween, one dressed as Mickey Mouse, the other dressed as an ACORN volunteer trying to register him to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see Barack Obama on the news? He took time out to take his kids trick-or-treating,&quot; but he would &quot;only let them take candy from households making over $200,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, gosh, only four more days and then Sarah Palin has to give all those clothes back. It's amazing, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, daylight savings time. ... You know what that means? An extra hour for this stupid campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, a lot of voters in Florida have already cast their ballots using early voting. And here's the weird part. George Bush&quot; has been &quot;declared the winner again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In less than a week, President Bush will be a lame duck, as opposed to just being a lame president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a speech yesterday, Joe the plumber said that John McCain is a real American. And who better to say who is a real American than a fake plumber?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the plumber has &quot;now signed for real with a publicist and a manager,&quot; and he &quot;already has a book deal in the works. In fact, we have an advanced copy right here. It's called 'Eat, Pray, Flush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what else? Well, God bless John McCain. You know, I've got to give McCain credit for ignoring the polls and fighting on. The guy's a fighter. I mean, he's been declared dead by the pollsters and twice by his own doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, John McCain said people who live in coastal states like Florida should get more of the money from offshore drilling. I think that's called 'spreading the wealth around,' isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Barack Obama's campaign accused John McCain of looking in the rearview mirror, which would make McCain the only guy over 70 who actually does that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is in the Halloween spirit. I love that. Even the Democratic presidential candidate changed his name. He's now Barack-O-Lantern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I like about Halloween is bobbing for apples,&quot; or &quot;as Dick Cheney likes to call it, 'apple boarding.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Halloween&quot; is &quot;the dead walking among the living. That's what Halloween is. You know, they come back the life and they're dead, but they're walking around. No, wait a minute, that's the McCain campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is struggling to get crowds at some places. For a speech yesterday, he bussed in 4,000 school kids to fill the stands,&quot; but the plan &quot;backfired&quot; when the &quot;kids wanted to know why Santa was so angry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama made a special stop in Chicago...so he could see his daughters in their Halloween costumes. ... Apparently, Obama's daughters wanted to be a princess and a fairy, but he made them dress as hope and change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that 33 million people saw Barack Obama's infomercial. ... Very successful, yeah. As a result, John McCain's thinking of making one, but his is for the Craftmatic Adjustable Bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey says she plans to attend Barack Obama's election night rally in Chicago. Yeah. That's great, yeah. So, win or lose, Obama's going home with a new car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The top selling political costume&quot; this Halloween &quot;is Sarah Palin,&quot; but they &quot;had to put...out a special warning today. They told Sarah Palin's traveling press corps, 'Don't dress up as an animal or she might shoot you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin actually dressed up herself. She found the cutest Little Mermaid costume at Bergdorf's for only $8,500, and it's made out of real dolphin. It's really nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain says Joe the plumber is his role model, and today he said he wants to take him to Washington if he's elected president. Not a bad idea,&quot; because they &quot;will need someone to install the safety rails at the White House toilets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody getting ready to vote tomorrow?&quot; According &quot;to statistics experts, the chances of any one person's vote deciding who wins the election is 60 million to 1,&quot; which is about &quot;the same odds as the Detroit Lions ever winning another game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to all the studies, somewhere between 8 and 14% of voters are still undecided.&quot; Do &quot;these morons&quot; need &quot;another year to figure this out? 'Gee, I wonder where my candidate stands on UFO abductions. I'm going to wait.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you get any of those annoying robocalls, those recorded messages from the candidate? ... I got one from Ralph Nader's campaign,&quot; but it turned out that &quot;it was not a recording. It was Ralph calling personally from a pay phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest AP poll, Ralph Nader getting less than 1% of the vote. ... How embarrassing. He's actually losing to low fat milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess already there have been some troubles at the polls. You may have heard about this. I understand Senator Larry Craig [was] arrested for tapping his foot in the voting booth next to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually,&quot; there is &quot;a good chance we could go to bed tomorrow night and not know who is running the country. Just the way it's been for the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the networks...are playing it very, very cautiously. You know, they don't want to show any favoritism. In fact, MSNBC announced today they're not even going to declare Barack Obama the winner until after the votes are counted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to recent news reports, Bill Clinton has now become an adviser to Barack Obama. Bill Clinton is giving advice to Barack Obama. You know who is really upset about this? Michelle Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And many believe in less than 24 hours, John McCain will have proved the pundits wrong&quot; when he makes it &quot;to Election Day&quot; and he is &quot;still breathing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, John McCain made stops in seven different states today. ... You know what regular people call that? Flying Southwest&quot; Airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had an odd thing happen&quot; to me when &quot;a kid came to my door last night and said, 'Trick or treat.' ... I said, 'Hey kid, too little too late.' He goes, 'I know, I'm dressed as John McCain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a...Halloween party over the weekend in Washington, DC, Dick Cheney went dressed as Darth Vader.&quot; But how &quot;ironic is this? He ran into Darth Vader, who was dressed as Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we all set our clocks back an hour this weekend for daylight savings time. How ironic is that? The only savings people have anymore is daylight, and they took that away from us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems fewer and fewer illegals are crossing the border because they can't find jobs. ... See, President Bush does have an immigration policy. It's called his economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to everybody who ran the New York City Marathon yesterday. ... And a special congratulations to this year's winner, Joe the runner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow&quot; marks the end of the presidential campaign, and Sarah Palin decided to celebrate early by charging &quot;one last $1,500 blouse to the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, they're still out campaigning. John McCain was campaigning in Florida today. He was at the Wal-Mart, working the antacid aisle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But endorsements are important in a campaign, even as late as we where now. ... And John McCain was endorsed by Dick Cheney. Yeah. So things just keep getting better and better for Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm no pundit, I'm no expert, but McCain needed Cheney's endorsement like I need more Lehman Brothers stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Hillary. She's all upset because&quot; the McCain campaign has been making robocalls that use a recording of her &quot;criticizing Barack Obama.&quot; Hillary &quot;is furious because she wanted to make those calls herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying now that weather could play a huge part in the campaign. ... For example, in order for McCain to win tomorrow, hell has to freeze over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Barack Obama campaigned in Florida and Virginia.&quot; McCain also &quot;campaigned in two states, panic and desperation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have a campaign prediction. And...like I say, I'm not a pundit and I don't like doing this and I hate to go out on a limb. But I have one prediction I'm confident&quot; about. President Bush &quot;will win the unpopular vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Twas the night before the election, and all through the nation, we're sick of politics, we need a vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain had a busy weekend. He campaigned in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia. He was only supposed to go to Ohio,&quot; but he &quot;kept getting lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain &quot;also found time somehow to go on 'Saturday Night Live.' ... Now, of course, John McCain and 'Saturday Night Live' are very different.&quot; One has &quot;been around forever and was on the verge of disappearing until Sarah Palin came along. The other's John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight at midnight in Arizona,&quot; John McCain &quot;appeared at his final campaign event, which is being called the 'Midnight Road to Victory.' ... Of course, for McCain, the midnight road to victory is the hallway between his bedroom and bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Party has asked President Bush to stay out of sight until after the election. ... And apparently, Bush has agreed to the strategy and is appearing weekly on the NBC series 'Kath &amp; Kim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend at a John McCain rally,&quot; California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger &quot;said that Barack Obama needs to exercise more because his legs are too skinny. ... Then he said, 'Now behold the awesome physical specimen that is John McCain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, a comedian, I guess on the radio, tricked Sarah Palin into getting on the phone by pretending he was French President Nicolas Sarkozy.&quot; The &quot;comedian says it was really difficult to trick Palin into believing he was Nicolas Sarkozy because she has no idea who that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe the plumber is back in the news. Joe the plumber is now saying he wants to write a book. Yeah. Joe's book would be called 'The Five People You Meet Fixing Toilets.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an election eve,&quot; and tomorrow, Americans will &quot;go to the polls in numbers&quot; that they are saying will be &quot;bigger even than the third week of 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two Canadian deejays who call themselves the Masked Avengers...managed&quot; over the weekend &quot;to get Sarah Palin on the phone. And one of them pretended&quot; to be French President Nicholas Sarkozy, but Palin &quot;didn't know it was a prank call until he finally told her.&quot; The &quot;one good thing for Sarah Palin, though, is since the guys who made the call are Canadian, technically, you could make the case that this counts as foreign policy experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama was joined on stage by Bruce Springsteen in Ohio on Sunday. There was one tense moment when somebody in the audience yelled out 'Born in the USA' and Obama said, 'For the last time, yes, I was!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Barack Obama on becoming the 44th President of the United States. ... You know, it's amazing. Barack Obama won in Florida and still became President. That never happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, Democrats are asking for a recount. They can't believe they won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; did &quot;I call it or what? Six months&quot; ago, &quot;I predicted Ralph Nader would come in third.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, there was a huge celebration over at Barack Obama headquarters, otherwise known as MSNBC.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, right after Barack Obama clinched&quot; his victory, &quot;TV cameras caught Jesse Jackson standing at the celebration with tears&quot; in his eyes. Not &quot;because Barack won, because he makes more than $250,000 a year.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize this is our first black president since the first season of '24'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were worried about the 'Bradley effect,&quot; but &quot;apparently,&quot; that &quot;was not nearly as strong as the 'Bush effect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After congratulating president-elect Obama, President Bush called John McCain to commend him on his well-fought campaign.&quot; Bush &quot;also phoned Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;said, 'Oh yeah, I'm sure this is the real Bush. I'm not falling for that again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush said today that he watched coverage on TV last night and he was amazed. He was amazed. He couldn't believe how many states there were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got to admit, as a comedian, I'm going to miss President Bush, because Barack Obama is not easy to do jokes about. He doesn't give you a lot to go on. See, this is why God gave us Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is really, really happy that John McCain did not win last night? The boyfriend of Sarah Palin's daughter. He doesn't have to get married now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Sarah Palin was pretty upset last night,&quot; but not &quot;because she lost.&quot; No, she was upset because now she has &quot;to give all of her clothes back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course the big mantra was, 'Yes, we can.' That was the theme, 'Yes, we can.' Unless you're a gay couple in California, then it's, 'No, you can't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, California passed a bill banning gay marriage and San Francisco voters defeated a ballet proposition that would have decriminalized prostitution. So, it's a bad day for straight guys and gay guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And turnout in Hollywood was...huge.&quot; In &quot;fact, for the first time ever, there were more celebrities in voting booths than in rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this was most expensive election in history, costing over $1 billion. Do you realize that is the equivalent of three Wall Street CEO bonuses?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you get a lot of those robo-calls over the weekend? Those stupid things. I got one from Governor Schwarzenegger.&quot; Then &quot;again, isn't every call from Arnold Schwarzenegger a robo-call, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schwarzenegger &quot;was asking people to get out and vote. I think that's what he said. Either that or&quot; he was asking &quot;'the public to get more boats.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody get&quot; a &quot;robo-call from&quot; Bill Clinton? They &quot;had those out there, too. See, I knew it was from Clinton right away, because if a man answers, it automatically hangs up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; in &quot;what has to be one of the most ridiculous moments yesterday, it looks like convicted Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska has won re-election. ... How does that make the guy who lost feel, huh? What's that concession speech like? 'We gave it our best, but the voters are preferred a convicted, 84-year-old felon who's going to prison.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attention passengers, the Straight Talk Express is no longer in service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama is our new president. And I think I speak for most Americans when I say, anybody mind if he starts a little early?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would like to say one thing to Sen. John McCain. Listen, Senator, you don't show up for me, America doesn't show up for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Republicans had a bad night all around. ... Even the crooked voting machines in Florida broke down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But right about now, Joe the plumber is meeting with his transition team. They're going to help ease him from obscurity back to oblivion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Sarah Palin, ladies and gentlemen?&quot; She is &quot;on her way back to Alaska, and I'm thinking, oh, I wouldn't want to be a moose now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the bright side, at least now Tina Fey can spend Saturdays with her family again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the concession speech last night? John McCain was generous, he was gracious, he was statesmanlike, and I was thinking, well, he should have tried that earlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way,&quot; McCain's &quot;concession speech last night was so effective, so positive that he shot up 4 points in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the concession speech, every time that McCain would mention Barack Obama, people booed. ... And finally, McCain&quot; could not ignore it &quot;any longer,&quot; and he had &quot;to stop the speech.&quot; He &quot;said, 'All right, that's enough, Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People all over the world...are celebrating&quot; Barack Obama's victory. In fact, Sarah Palin &quot;watched the Russians celebrating from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched&quot; Obama's &quot;victory speech in Grant Park. ... I actually loved watching the shots of the crowd,&quot; which &quot;looked like a Benetton ad -- different races, different ages, all different kinds of people. I thought it was fantastic.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;over at McCain's speech, there were all different kinds of white people.&quot; They &quot;had tons of them -- yuppies, golfers, Osmonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's victory&quot; would not &quot;have been not possible without the help of the leaders who came before him -- Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson,&quot; and &quot;most importantly,&quot; President Bush, who has set &quot;the bar pretty low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market dropped over 400 points today, which is not a reflection on Obama.&quot; No, the brokers just &quot;realized they've still got three months of George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, the ban on gay marriage passed. Gay people are furious. They stormed the State Capitol in Sacramento and caused $3 million in improvements to the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, after Barack Obama was declared the winner, President Bush called Obama&quot; and &quot;promised to work with him to guarantee a smooth transition. ... When we heard this, Obama said, 'Thanks, but you've done enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the major networks declared Barack Obama the winner at 11:00 last night,&quot; except &quot;for MSNBC, which declared Obama the winner six months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds of thousands of people turned out for&quot; Obama's victory rally in Chicago. But there was an &quot;awkward moment when Obama put on a hat that said 'proud to be Muslim' and screamed, 'Suckas!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama won the state of Florida,&quot; which &quot;means that it went from a red state to a blue state. That's huge, yeah. It's historic, because it's the first time something turned blue in Florida and they didn't have to call a medic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of speculation about Sarah Palin's future,&quot; but last night, she &quot;denied rumors that she's getting ready to run for president in 2012.&quot; Palin &quot;said, 'That's a long time away. I'll be a great-grandmother by then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Late last night, Sen. Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of these United States.&quot; And even &quot;if you are a Republican or a member of one of the small crazy people parties, you could find something to be happy about it, whether it's that we have our first-ever African-American president or even that we have our first vice president with hair plugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush called Sen. Obama last night&quot; to &quot;congratulate him and this is an actual quote. He said, 'What an awesome night for you and your family.' I think his eloquence is what we will remember most about&quot; Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama thanked the President for his call and for all he did to help him get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey if you think about it, President Bush is at least partially responsible for us having our first black president, so...never let it be said he didn't accomplish anything. Maybe George Bush doesn't hate black people after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush...invited&quot; Obama &quot;to come visit him at the White House, which was a nice thing to do. He wants to show him, I guess, the presidential tree house and teach him how to turn&quot; the Oval Office couch cushions &quot;into a fort. All the fun stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real challenge, though, is for Joe Biden because he's got to figure out how to get Dick Cheney out of the vice presidential mansion. As you know,&quot; Dick Cheney is &quot;armed and has a history of shooting old men.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this week has taught us anything, it's taught us that America's a place where anything is possible, except maybe the Detroit Lions winning a football game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One touching moment the other night during Barack Obama's speech. Oprah was crying, did you see that? Jesse Jackson was crying. Hillary Clinton was crying. I think Hillary's still crying, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political analysts are saying today that Barack Obama's win was unprecedented. Which again confused President Bush. He said, 'Unprecedented? You mean, he didn't win? He got unpresidented?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is now gonna receive the daily White House intelligence briefing on things like, you know, security and terrorism, stuff like that. It's the same briefing President Bush gets every day, but without the pictures and the color by numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today, 70% of dyslexics voted for 'Amabo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama spent his first day as President-elect putting together his transition team. And if you believe MSNBC, by tomorrow he will have chosen all 12 of his disciples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love how the different news outlets put their own slant on it? Like see how Fox News is covering Barack Obama's first 24 hours? They said, 'Day one, America held hostage.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;has chosen Illinois Congressman Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff. Rahm Emanuel. Apparently Barack's first order of business, no guys with regular names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are now asking if Obama's being in the White House will be a return to Camelot. You know like what it was during the Kennedys? That return to Camelot -- as opposed to the last eight years which is the return to the 'Dukes of Hazzard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama promised a new America in which the powerless will have a voice. So, he's already reaching out to Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of famous sound bites will be remembered for this campaign. There were some good ones. Barack Obama saying...'We are the change that we seek.' John McCain saying, 'I would rather lose an election than lose a war.' Sarah Palin saying, 'Do you have this in size 6?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if that's true or not, but earlier, today, Sarah Palin put McCain's campaign bus on eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says if he was fortunate to win the White House, he would like to install a basketball court. That's what he said. It's gonna be built right on top of what is now the bowling alley. ... You see, he was a bad bowler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Obama promised his daughters a puppy when they move into the White House. .... Do you know the name of the dog in the Clinton White House? Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer &quot;will not face criminal charges in that prostitution scandal. The US Attorney said that spitzer has acknowledged being a client but there was no evidence of misuse of public funds. Well, that should make Spitzer's wife happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Sarah Palin is feeding her family with Caribou Helper!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the show. You folks are in a remarkable good mood today. And considering the economy, doesn't that make you sick?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hookers in New York City are offering their Obama special. $50 and you get change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the election is over, people around the world are hoping that America will be less arrogant. Yeah. Ah, who the hell cares what those foreigners think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama hits the ground running. He is already naming people to be part of the staff. He picked a guy Rahm Emanuel...Rahm Emanuel, is that the holiday the writers are always taking off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right about now, John McCain is at home saying, 'If only I didn't anger Dave, if only I didn't anger Dave.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Obama believes that the election results gave him a mandate -- a mandate, that is what got that Senator Larry Craig in trouble, wasn't it?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama family looking for a White House dog. And you are going to think this is crazy. Earlier today the Beverly Hills Chihuahua dropped off his picture and resume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obamas want to adopt a stray dog from the pound. And I think that is admirable. I believe the last president to bring a stray dog into the White House got impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They picked up a stray and what they are going to do, the Obamas are going it to have the stray clipped, groomed and blow-dried. The same thing the Republicans did with Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin has &quot;not taken the defeat well. And it must be true because today before shooting a moose she pistol whipped it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some kind of a woman, some kind of a whack job passenger on the American Airlines or United Airlines flight to Chicago was going crazy. And finally she got so bad that the flight attendants took a roll of duct tape and took the woman and duct taped her right to her seat. Duct taped -- hysterical woman, duct taped it her right to her seat. Please try to get over this, Hillary. Please try to get over this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, apparently, First Lady Laura Bush called Michelle Obama and invited her and her young daughters to the White House. Isn't that nice? Laura Bush told Mrs. Obama, 'While I give you a tour, the girls can watch Spongebob with the President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Japan, officials in a small town called Obama -- there's a town in Japan called Obama -- say they're going to invite Barack Obama to visit. Yeah. And actually, a similar trip happened after Bill Clinton was elected, and he was invited to Horndog, Thailand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama spent the day thanking the people who helped him win the election. That's right. Yeah, and actually, Obama's first phone call was to Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they were prepping Sarah Palin for the debates, they found out that she thought Africa was a country, not a continent. Yeah. Now, to be fair to Sarah Palin, it is hard to see Africa from Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chinese President Hu Jintao says that now that Barack Obama has been elected, he is looking forward to take the relationship between China and the US to the next level. That's what he said. Yeah. Then he said, 'Who knows -- maybe we'll even go all the way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama &quot;was briefed this morning on the state of the economy, and this afternoon, he called McCain to offer him the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Sarah Palin knew Wolf Blitzer's name was Wolf, would she shoot him from a helicopter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin &quot;went back to Alaska. As she got off the plane yesterday, her supporters chanted '2012, 2012.' When McCain got off the plane, they chanted, 'Use the handrail, use the handrail. Careful, grandpa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think Sarah Palin is just a flash in the pan. People in Washington started calling her 'Sanjaya Palin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effects of the Barack Obama election win still reverberating throughout the country,&quot; but this &quot;was actually in the paper today, that both parties are already preparing for 2012. Isn't that unbelievable? But I was thinking, it's got to be tough for Barack Obama to come up with a campaign slogan for 2012. I mean, what's it going to be? 'Don't change, everything's fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Been a lot of stories from Germany about how America has come to terms with its past and is beginning to make up for it. Now look. I know our country is not perfect, but we do a pretty good job working on our problems. Do we need a lecture from Germany? I mean, hey, when they elect a Jewish chancellor, give me a call. Okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been rumors if the economy continues to get worse,&quot; Barack Obama &quot;may have to suspend plans for any income or capital gains tax increases. In fact, they say Obama's considering suspending all tax increases, except those on Joe the plumber. His are going to go up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see...Joe the plumber on the news today? Isn't his 15 minutes of lame just about up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Joe the plumber &quot;was asked how he felt about his role in the election. This is what he said. He said, 'I didn't dream of becoming a household name. Now, I'm right up there with Ajax.' Yeah, except the big difference is Ajax works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is speculating now what the future of the GOP will be. GOP now stands for, of course, 'Gang up On Palin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big story. The rumor is the GOP is blaming Sarah Palin for losing the election. But to be fair, Sarah Palin didn't pick Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and a reporter from Fox News who interviewed Sarah Palin, said that Sarah Palin didn't know that Africa was a continent, to which President Bush said, 'I didn't know either. I thought it was a vowel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this story in 'Newsweek' this week? One of the things they complained about is that when some campaign staffers went up to Sarah Palin's hotel room to talk to her, she answered the door wearing nothing but a towel. Have you heard this? Apparently, some of the guys on the campaign staff complained. Yeah, yeah, the ones it didn't happen to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush interested in writing his memoirs after he leaves office. He wants to remember his days in the White House, while the rest of us, of course, are trying to forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Bush's dog, Barney, bit a White House reporter. President Bush said, 'Finally!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else happened? Oh, it was revealed that Dick Cheney...spent Election Day in South Dakota shooting peasants -- I mean pheasants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in other election news, Massachusetts voted to decriminalize marijuana. It won by 65% of the vote, which is amazing&quot; when &quot;you consider most marijuana supporters don't even show up at the polls until next Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In San Francisco, the proposition to decriminalize prostitution was defeated.&quot; There are, however, &quot;many who believe that prostitution should be legalized, because then it could be controlled and taxed. ... You know who's against this? Hookers making over $250,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a Federal report, unemployment claims went up by 300,000. And that's just Republicans in Washington.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten things George W. Bush Wants To Accomplish While Still In Office:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Finish those little projects he keeps putting off, like fixing the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Get Cheney a 'goodbye' defibrillator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Challenge Lincoln's ghost to rassle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Host farewell mixer for the detainees at Gitmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Now that he's got nothing to lose, nail a hefty intern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Cement his legacy with a two month vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Put Chuck Norris on the nickel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. See if Obama can take over sooner, like Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Get Condi laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hasn't he done enough already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's Friday and the lines at the polls are finally getting shorter. That's good news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't understand. The election was held Tuesday, and still 6.5% of Americans are undecided. Can you believe that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Obama won but they still haven't broken it to McCain. That's what I heard. Did you hear the same thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel bad for John McCain. I guess that endorsement from Dick Cheney came a little too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks miss the campaign a little bit? Here's what I miss. I miss the sexy robo-calls from Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, don't worry about Sarah Palin. She's already back to selling Mary Kay products, so she's going to be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is getting ready to move out of the White House.&quot; In fact, he &quot;spent all...day&quot; today &quot;in the supply room, stealing stationery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is sad. You hate hearing about this, but staffers are saying that John McCain is depressed. And I think there is something true to the story, because I heard today that he had made an appointment with Joe the therapist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a terrible week on Wall Street. The economy is in tatters. You know, this is what happens when Sarah Palin stops buying clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at his first press conference as president-elect, Barack Obama said America will succeed if we can put aside partisanship and politics. Nice. Yeah. In other words, we're totally screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Sports Illustrated' says Barack Obama is going to install a basketball court at the White House.&quot; But &quot;in order to make room, workers at the White House will have to get rid of President Bush's Slip 'n Slide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Kenya,&quot; thousands &quot;of expectant mothers are planning to name their babies after Barack Obama. ... Yeah. The Kenyans are really glad Obama won, because in Swahili, 'John McCain' means 'your goat just ate my daughter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey has said she will not accept the role of an ambassador to a foreign country if it were offered to her by Barack Obama. ... On the other hand, Obama did announce that his new surgeon general is Dr. Phil.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the smaller elections across the country on Tuesday were very close. The election for mayor in a small town in Minnesota was a tie, so they decided to choose a winner with a coin toss. ... Unfortunately, the economy is so bad, no one had a coin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This country is a mess. We all know that,&quot; but &quot;Barack Obama is not wasting one moment trying to clean it up. He was elected on Tuesday night. Already he's selected his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He is said to be close to naming the secretary of the Treasury, the secretary of State, and the newly created position, secretary of Kicking out George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama held the first news conference today as president-elect. Some veteran White House reporters were a little bit confused because he didn't make up any words and almost everything he said made sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Barack Obama had their big meeting yesterday. And to tell you the truth, they found with all their differences, they had one thing in common. Neither one of them trust the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama being very deferential to President Bush. Obama said last week, 'The United States can only have one president at a time,' to which Bush said, 'Hey, that's not what Cheney told me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the election, Barack Obama's family in Kenya slaughtered four bulls, 16 chickens,&quot; and &quot;an assortment of goats out of happiness. ... And in Alaska, out of anger, Sarah Palin slaughtered four bears, 16 moose, and a bunch of foxes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin finally speaking to reporters. And whoo, not a moment too soon, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, she was on Fox News with Greta Van Susteren. Today, she was on the 'Today' show with Matt Lauer. In fact, this week, she's going to speak to a bunch of other governors in Miami. Then, she's going to go on a long tour to return clothes to different department stores all across America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Governor Palin continuing to defend herself about that clothes issue. She says she has never even stepped foot in a Neiman Marcus. In fact, she thought Neiman Marcus was the president of the Philippines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Barney the White House dog bit a reporter last Friday. And today, Rahm Emanuel bit Barney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know about this, President Bush's dog biting the White House reporter? Well, today President Bush defended the dog. ... He said, 'Hey, I know how frustrating it is when you aren't able to express yourself by talking.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's a new rumor that Hillary Clinton may end up secretary of State, which means she would have to spend the next four years traveling all around the world, to which Bill said, 'Yes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the Senate, 90-year-old Robert Byrd will step down as appropriations committee chair. He'll be replaced by Hawaiian Senator Daniel Inouye, who is 84. Finally, we're getting some young blood in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of young blood, we are very excited. Senator John McCain on the show tonight. And I thought this was very nice. He blew off an interview with Katie Couric to be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the United States Postal Service said the economy's so bad, it will have its first layoffs in the history of the Post Office. May lay off 40,000 workers, yeah. Company officials said they have no idea what happened. They don't understand why people aren't using the mail like they used to. And they said all 40,000 workers will be notified by e-mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know. Is that a good idea, 40,000 disgruntled postal workers at holiday time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to 'Sesame Street.' They're now 39 years old this week. Who would have guessed 39 years ago, 'Sesame Street' would still be going strong and Wall Street would wind up getting canceled?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Veterans Day. John McCain laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is great by the way. He's back at his full-time job, yelling at people who park in front of his house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought when the election was finished,&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;would go back to Alaska and we might not hear from her again. I couldn't be more wrong. She was on the 'Today' show cooking the other day. ... Sure, she reads all the cook books, so she knows what she's doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now we see some bitterness, we see back biting, and Sarah Palin is saying that the reason they lost the election is the media. ... Well, yeah, because it's their fault that she entered beauty contests instead of a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're not going to believe this. Bush's approval rating has dropped to an historic low.&quot; And &quot;I'm telling you now, this guy has really got his work cut out for him for his third term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. The Bush Presidency is covered under the lemon law,&quot; so that &quot;means we could be getting our money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama announced he's moving into the White House&quot; with &quot;his family,&quot; including &quot;his mother-in-law. ... A mother-in-law in the White House? ... I thought this was the Administration that was against torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the Secret Service that follows the candidates around and stuff? They have nicknames for the people that they work with, like Barack Obama,&quot; whose Secret Service nickname is &quot;Renegade. ... John McCain, I think they called him Maverick.&quot; And &quot;President Bush's Secret Service nickname is Occupant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was a big day because George Bush graciously invited President-elect Barack Obama&quot; to the White House. Obama &quot;thought for a minute he was getting a 21-gun salute,&quot; but &quot;it turned out it was just Cheney fooling around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin did another interview today&quot; on the &quot;Today&quot; show. In fact, she has been interviewed by &quot;NBC, Fox News, local news, magazines. She's talking so much they can hear her from Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is mad at Barack Obama because Obama leaked details of the private meeting they had yesterday in the Oval Office. ... Yeah, Bush says, 'What happens in the couch fort stays in the couch fort.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Michelle Obama wants her mother to move into the White House with them. Yeah. Yeah, this is expected to be the first time Barack uses his veto power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the Obama girls is allergic to dogs,&quot; so &quot;someone has offered the Obamas a puppy that is completely hairless. Yeah. In fact, the children have already given the puppy the name James Carville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; President-elect Barack Obama &quot;and his wife Michelle visited with President and Mrs. Bush. Obama has been very critical of the President. Fortunately though, the President cannot read, so he didn't know about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said his favorite part of the tour was when the President showed him the secret dial under his desk that he uses to control the price of gasoline.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess after the election last week, Barack Obama took his wife on a date to their favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. ... And today Bill Clinton, John Edwards and Eliot Spitzer called him a new kind of Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they move into the White House, Barack Obama's going to be getting a dog for his daughters,&quot; but &quot;he's very strict. He said, 'You are going to have to feed it, you are going to have to give it water, and you are going to have to clean up after him. Do you understand that?' And Joe Biden said, 'Yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to CNN, Barack Obama's mother-in-law might be moving into the White House with them. Although, he may be able to get out of it under the domestic terrorist law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush briefed Barack Obama on the state of the nation this week. I don't want to say things look bad, but after the briefing, Obama called McCain and said, 'Do you still want the job?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush really understands this whole transition thing. Like he said today, he's glad the Obamas are moving in the day he leaves because he didn't want to have to sell the White House in such a down market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is all over the news lately. She told Matt Lauer on the 'Today' show that, yes, the rumors were true, on election night, she did want to deliver her own concession speech and she was disappointed that she couldn't. Well, she shouldn't feel bad. Wait till 2012. Deliver it then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you been following this election in Minnesota? This is crazy. Only a few hundred votes separate the two candidates, and ballots are showing up in, like, the trunks of people's cars. Yeah, all kinds of odd places. Everybody is yelling fraud. Turns out, Minnesota is an old Indian word that means Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's an awful lot of talk right now about a possible Detroit bailout. You may have heard about this. Today, President-elect Barack Obama said, 'Yes, we absolutely have to act now. We can't allow the Detroit Lions to get any worse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's bad. ... The economy is so bad, Lou Dobbs moved the show to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exxon Mobil had to lay off 25 congressmen. That's how bad the economy is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Post Office may lay off 4,000 workers. Yeah, 4,000 workers. Unless those layoff notices get lost in the mail, and then all bets are off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Egyptian archaeologists have discovered a 4300-year-old pyramid. ... And I'm thinking, there's yet another house John McCain forgot about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an exciting time in Washington.&quot; Barack Obama is &quot;very busy.&quot; He is &quot;meeting with his advisors and picking out a cabinet. Meanwhile, John McCain is at Applebee's, blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says he'll be living in the White House with his family, his two daughters and his wife, and his mother-in-law. ... Yeah, he may want to rethink closing Guantanamo, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see&quot; Sarah Palin &quot;on the 'Today' show a couple of days ago, cooking? ... And people say, 'Well, can she cook?' Of course she can cook.&quot; After all, she &quot;cooked McCain's goose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The transition is continuing in Washington. Vice President-elect Joe Biden is meeting with Dick Cheney tomorrow. Cheney will give Biden a tour of the VP residence and hand over the keys to the dungeon, that kind of thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of Peru has offered to give Barack Obama a hairless dog for the White House. ... But didn't Obama just spend months trying to keep a little bald guy out of the White House? I don't know if he's going to be so keen to suddenly invite one in.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today...he regrets the infamous 'mission accomplished' banner. He said...if he was going to do it again, the banner would have said 'git 'er done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack and Michelle Obama are looking for a church in Washington to attend. ... Apparently, the Obamas ask every prospective pastor the same question: 'Have you ever been videotaped screaming, 'God damn America?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service recently gave Barack Obama's wife and daughters code names. These are the code names -- Renaissance, Rosebud and Radiance. ... Yeah, apparently, the agent who created the names has a secret dream to get into the perfume business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only 69 days until Barack Obama becomes our 44th president. It's going to be weird not having Dick Cheney in charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little...Philadelphia history for you. It was on this day in 1789 that Benjamin Franklin said those famous words: 'In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.' Death and Taxes, which ironically&quot; were also the Secret Service code names &quot;for John McCain and Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was a big meeting today between Vice President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President Dick Cheney, or as they're calling it, 'Plugged Hair meets Plugged Arteries.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But see that's cruel. See, I prefer to call them 'Foot In Mouth' meets 'Shot In Face.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has called for emergency assistance for the auto industry. She said it is an absolute emergency. But see, since it's Nancy Pelosi, nobody can tell from her facial expression it's an emergency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson went on a luxury cruise this week to try and come up with a plan to revive the Republican Party and to get it more in touch with average Americans. I got an idea. How about no more luxury cruises?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba's Raul Castro is going to visit Russia next year, to which President Bush said, 'Man, how long is that raft trip going to take?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'National Enquirer' now says that after campaign staffers blamed her for losing the election, Sarah Palin went on a rampage of yelling and screaming and throwing things. But see, that's the 'National Enquirer,' huh? You going to believe them? ... Hey, these are the same people who, a year ago, said John Edwards was having an affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN reporting that President Bush's approval rating is the all time lowest ever recorded for a president: 76% disapprove of the job he's doing. The other 24% work for AIG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of The Dick Cheney/Joe Biden Meeting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Cheney barred the door and yelled, 'You'll never take me alive!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It was 3 hours of Guitar Hero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Biden gave Cheney the number for his hair plug guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Enjoyed a nice lunch interrupted by two shotgun blasts and a heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Lynne Cheney blinking out in Morse code ? 'Help me. Help me. Help me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Cheney had to leave early to get Bush's head unstuck from a microwave oven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Had a heart attack during a heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. They agreed the 'Late Show Fun Facts' book may just be the thing to bring this country together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For about 20 minutes, Cheney's pacemaker got HBO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon seeing Biden, Cheney muttered, 'I was hoping for the Alaskan broad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden got together&quot; today &quot;with Dick Cheney and the girls, the ladies, the wives, they all had dinner. And the meal went great. I mean, they only had to shock Cheney back to life twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at one point during this meeting, Joe Biden turns to Cheney and he says, 'Dick, tell me, what is it like being second-in-command? And Cheney said, 'Hell, I don't know, ask Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Sarah Palin?&quot; She &quot;could be appearing on 'Desperate Housewives,'&quot; and &quot;when John McCain heard about this, he went to his staff and he said, 'I would kind of like to be on 'Bonanza.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin is trying to be bipartisan. She said she actually wants to help Barack Obama. And I said, 'Well, hasn't she helped him enough already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama&quot; has chosen Rahm Emanuel to be his &quot;chief of staff.&quot; Obama is &quot;also bringing&quot; in &quot;Madeleine Albright to be part of the transition team. So now, it looks like what Barack Obama is doing, he's just bringing back all our favorites from the Clinton Administration, you know, except for that heavyset intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush was in New York, and he gave a speech about the financial crisis and other major problems facing the country. That's right. The speech was called 'So Long Suckers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, DC, today, Dick Cheney gave Joe Biden tour of the vice president's living quarters. ... Yeah, afterwards, Biden said he loves the house, but he'll probably turn the dungeon back into a red room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Party is considering choosing an African-American to be their party's chairman. Yeah. Unfortunately, neither guy wants the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American Express is in financial trouble.&quot; The company &quot;reportedly wants a $5.5 billion loan from the government. Yeah, unfortunately for American Express, the government only takes Visa and Diners Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is nice. Barack Obama's daughters he been invited to appear in an episode of the show, 'Hannah Montana.' Isn't that nice? Yeah, President Bush is furious and insists that because he's still president, he should be invited first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, they held the Great Southern California ShakeOut. There was a giant drill to prepare us for the big earthquake. Now, don't confuse it with the government giving money to Wall Street. That was the Great American Shakedown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a pretend disaster. And FEMA pretended to respond. So, it was all very realistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, geologists said that the point of the drill was to show what kind of damage a 7.8 earthquake could do. ... They said it would destroy almost as many homes as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama, still looking...for a new White House dog. The search is on. In fact, do you realize he has spent more time selecting a dog than John McCain did selecting a running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush...had some good dog advice for the President-elect. Bush advised him to get a dog that's easy to train. Bush said it took almost eight years to get Barney to bite that reporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visited Wall Street yesterday. Nothing to do with the economy. He just wanted to see something that had dropped more than his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CNN, Barack Obama's popularity going into office is higher than Clinton's, Reagan's or either of the President Bushes when they entered office. It's much higher. Well, hang on, hang on. That's on CNN. On Fox, he's somewhere between Attila the Hun and lead poisoning, okay? So, you have to pick your channels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush briefed President-elect Obama on the state of the nation this week. You know, look, I don't want to say things look bad, but Barack Obama's new slogan, 'Maybe we can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this coming Monday, Barack Obama is going to have a meeting with John McCain. They're going to get together. McCain's still being a little stubborn. He insisted it be a town hall meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President-elect Joe Biden met with Vice President Dick Cheney&quot; yesterday, and &quot;you'd think there'd be animosity -- no, no. Vice President Cheney, very nice. In fact, Cheney even sent his own personal ambulance to pick him up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, looks like Guantanamo Bay is going to be closed. ... Hey,&quot; that &quot;shows how tough times are, when even terrorists are losing their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, in a speech about the economy, President Bush said, 'Our actions are having an impact.' Yeah, I think it's called a recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and you know that $750 billion bailout money they needed right away to correct the crisis? ... Turns out it isn't going to be used for what they set it up for. Treasury Secretary Paulson changed his mind and is going to use it for something else. Hey, we changed our mind, too. Give us our money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks is having trouble. Their profits have dropped 97% in the fourth quarter. Is that unbelievable? Economists say Starbucks customers are switching to a cheaper alternative, like cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, AIG executives are only drinking domestic champagne now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know AIG stands for? I didn't even know. You know what it means? Alliance In Greed. I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Post,' Sarah Palin may appear on the season finale of 'Desperate Housewives.' They said she's seen the show several times, which more than qualifies her as an actress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 2000, former President Bill Clinton&quot; became the &quot;first president&quot; since the Vietnam War &quot;to visit Vietnam. ... At least that's where he told Hillary he was going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and his family&quot; are &quot;still looking for a dog for the White House. I hear the...Beverly Hills Chihuahua is on the short list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier in the week, you know, this is historic when you think about it,&quot; President-elect Barack Obama went &quot;to the White House for a tour with George Bush, President-inept.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not much of a tour. At one point, George Bush pointed out the window and said, 'Over there, that's where we play tee ball.' And that was it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Bushes are packing up. This is eight years they've lived in the White House, and this is interesting. They're going to be gone in January, and the $4 billion moving contract went to Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, right here on CBS, a very popular show...called 'The Ghost Whisperer'&quot; aired. And in tonight's &quot;episode, the Ghost Whisperer&quot; was &quot;surrounded by walking dead. You know, Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, AARP, American association of retired people, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. They're talking now, because of financial reasons, that there may be a ? they may merge with AAA. ... And if they do, it will be a brand-new organization that helps people who own old cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks going to the movies this weekend? Go see the new James Bond movie.&quot; The &quot;plot of the...movie is fantastic. In this&quot; movie, &quot;Bond retires&quot; and &quot;turns his spy business over to his idiot son, James W. Bond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, remember him? His inauguration is still months away, but they're saying...the transition efforts are going to cost $12 million.&quot; It &quot;sounds like a lot, but it's less than what Sarah Palin would've spent on the inaugural gown and the tiara, the cape, and the scepter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historic news, this was in the paper today. The Republican Party is considering naming the first African-American chairman in their party's history. Isn't that incredible? ... Yeah, unfortunately, Republicans are having a hard time finding an African-American who's white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the articles you read now are about this transition,&quot; about how the Obamas are &quot;going to Washington&quot; and the &quot;family is going to have to adjust. They've been writing about when Barack Obama's daughters&quot; and how &quot;they're going to have to get used to having a chef cook all their meals. ... Yeah, the White House chef is furious about the kids. And he said, 'Great, four more years of making SpaghettiOs and chicken fingers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain was once again campaigning yesterday -- this is true -- this time for a Republican congressman who's facing a runoff election. So, McCain is out there stumping for him. And you can tell McCain's a little bitter about his defeat, because, instead of saying, 'My friends,' he now says, 'My ungrateful bastards.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;True story, people in the publishing industry are starting to speculate that President Bush is going to write a book after he leaves office. Yeah. Yeah, and by write, they mean draw.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest rumor is that Barack Obama has offered the job of secretary of State to Hillary Clinton. But that's kind of sad, don't you think? I mean, think how close Hillary Clinton came to being the first female president of the United States. Her next job offer, oh, a secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I think Hillary Clinton would be a great secretary of State. You know, she can cackle in seven different languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today in Chicago, for the first time since the election, John McCain sat down with President-elect Barack Obama. Pretty impressive. Obama agreed to sit down and talk to McCain without any preconditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when Sarah Palin heard about McCain meeting with Obama, she accused McCain of palling around with terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Barack Obama had to give up his Blackberry&quot; because &quot;they're easy to hack into. In fact, when Obama heard he might have to give it up, he said ? 'OMG! WTF?' He couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. You probably heard this story on '60 Minutes.' Barack Obama's mother-in-law might be moving into the White House with him. See, Joe Biden was right. Hostile forces will test him in the first few months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pirates off the coast of Somalia have seized a Saudi-owned oil supertanker, one of those big supertankers. Pirates ripping off an oil company? Boy, talk about no honor among thieves, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big rumor is that General Motors will reportedly run out of money very soon, unless the government helps them out with this bailout, or the loan, whatever you call it. Isn't that amazing? I mean, all those times a car salesman told you he was losing money on the deal, he wasn't lying.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is facing Federal charges for insider trading. This officially makes November 2008 the worst month ever for mavericks, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Good Things About Being Named James Bond: &quot;1. President Bush keeps calling me about capturing Bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? They're talking about Hillary Clinton maybe&quot; becoming &quot;secretary of State. She takes that job, it means she will be spending a lot of time away from home, so today she took out her pantsuit with the travel stickers...and then she bought an electronic ankle bracelet for Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this is a tough process because when&quot; they &quot;are going to appoint to you a Cabinet level position.&quot; It &quot;is a vetting...process&quot; that involves a &quot;questionnaire. And there was some trouble because they filled out the questionnaire, running the check on Hillary. Listen to this. Turns out she was married to a guy who was once impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is kind of making up and getting back together. Senator McCain and President-elect Barack Obama&quot; even &quot;got together and had a nice visit. And...Obama thanked McCain for choosing that nutty Alaskan chick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then...Obama said to McCain, 'Hey, I'm catching up with you. I just got a second home.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama now, while he is the President, he can't use his...Blackberry. ... Fortunately the good news for John McCain, he can continue to use the Clapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something about New York City.&quot; You are &quot;going to have trouble believing&quot; it, &quot;but it's true. New York City is overrun with raccoons. ... It's so bad, they are thinking about bringing in Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to literary agents in New York, Sarah Palin is about to sign a $7 million book deal. ... They didn't say whether it's to write one or read one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Palin is &quot;going to sign&quot; the deal, &quot;and she is not ruling out the idea of running for the Senate in 2010. She's already formed a committee to explain to her what the Senate is, so it is looking that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night,&quot; &quot;'60 Minutes' had Barack Obama,&quot; and the show earned its &quot;highest ratings...in nine years.&quot; Actually, &quot;I think Obama's the youngest person they've had on the show in nine years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night,&quot; &quot;'60 Minutes,' Barack Obama...spoke at length about his life these days.&quot; He &quot;said that since he won the election, he has slept in his own bed every night.&quot; After &quot;hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Man, this guy has a lot to learn.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a big photo op...earlier today in Chicago, Barack Obama tried to smooth things over by meeting with his former opponent John McCain. ... Obama &quot;congratulated McCain on running a good campaign,&quot; while &quot;McCain congratulated Obama on being a stupid jerk face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about how&quot; Obama is &quot;going to get a dog for his little girls. Well, Barack says he's taking his time picking out a dog for his daughters because he's looking for a pet that won't shed its hair,&quot; which &quot;is the exact same reason, apparently, he picked Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was just reported a few minutes ago, the new attorney general is going to be Eric Holder. Here's what we know about him. His name is Eric Holder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now being reported that Hillary Clinton will accept the position of secretary of State. That just came out in the news. Actually, this works out...great for the Clintons. While Hillary is concentrating on foreign affairs, Bill can go back to concentrating on domestic affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The press is calling...Barack Obama the first wired president because he's very big on e-mails and the Internet and all that kind of stuff. But once he becomes president, he'll have to give up all personal communication devices because of security concerns. So, it looks like America's ready for a black president. We're just not ready for a Blackberry president.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says one of his top priorities once he becomes president is closing down Guantanamo Bay. To make sure it closes, he's going to turn it into a bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard this rumor? According to 'The New York Post,' Sarah Palin may appear on the season finale of 'Desperate Housewives.' That's the big news, yeah. And in a related story, John McCain just got a big Flomax commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to MSNBC, Sarah Palin could get $7 million when she signs her book deal. ... You know who's really excited about this? Neiman Marcus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to convicted Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska,&quot; who is &quot;85 years old. He didn't get any gifts. At least, he didn't report any.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forecasters at the Federal Reserve in Philadelphia say the US has been in a recession for the last 14 months. ... Thank you, Nostradamus. That's how you know things are slowing down, when forecasters are now predicting the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the space shuttle has reached the International Space Station. They're adding to it an extra bathroom, a kitchenette and two sleeping compartments, to which President Bush said, 'That will help, but it's still going to be a tough sell in this down market, you know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Somalian pirates have hijacked a Saudi super tanker full of oil and British citizens, and everyone is very angry about this. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wants to send troops to rescue the people, and President Bush wants to send in the Navy to rescue the oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the bright side, the pirates are selling the oil cheaper than the Saudis would have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The James Bond movie, 'Quantum of Solace,' number one at the box office. ... Doesn't that&quot; title &quot;sound like one of Barack Obama's new Cabinet members? 'Hi, I'm Barack. This is Rahm Emanuel and our new man, Quantum Solace.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard During Barack Obama's Meeting With John McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Oh, just preparing to be President. What have you been up to?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'I know a guy who would be a perfect Secretary of Plumbing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'What is the deal with that Alaskan babe?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Let's wrap this up; Wheel of Fortune's on.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Seriously, what was the deal with that Alaskan babe?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Actually, it's now the Straight Talk Express and Girls Gone Wild bus.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Uh John, this isn't another debate.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Where's the soup? Someone said there'd be soup!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'I know I'm trailing by 192 electoral votes two weeks after the election, but I've got you right where I want you!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Maybe you'd be President-elect if you hadn't crossed Letterman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold here in New York City today,&quot; &quot;so cold...that Sarah Palin spent $150,000 on mittens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Sarah Palin? ... A lot of people said, 'What will happen to her when she goes back to being the governor of Alaska?' Don't worry. Book deal, $7 million. She got it through a guy named Joe the Publisher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they said, 'Well, how about writing a book? She said, 'You betcha. As long as I don't have to read it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven million dollars. So maybe now she can afford her own clothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanksgiving just around the corner. Do you feel like Thanksgiving, folks? You know, it's a time when people can do nice things for others who are less fortunate. I hope you're planning on doing something for people less fortunate. For example, if you get the opportunity, if you have your Thanksgiving dinner, invite a Lehman brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is opening up more air space for travel during Thanksgiving. ... You're saying, 'What exactly are you talking about?' I'm talking about air space. You know, like between his ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain and Barack Obama met yesterday. You know, they're going to bury the hatchet. In politics, they call that 'reaching across the aisle.' ... Usually when John McCain reaches across the aisle, it's to grab the Metamucil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, like many people, uses&quot; a Blackberry, but the &quot;Secret Service says this is a security hazard,&quot; so &quot;they took it away. I'm thinking, well, this is not fair. George Bush, do they let him keep his Gameboy? What's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is putting his team together to take over the Administration. So far, he's got his mother-in-law,&quot; who is &quot;going to be living with him,&quot; and they are &quot;talking about Hillary for secretary of State. You have your mother-in-law and Hillary Clinton. Sounds like smooth sailing to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is waiting to see what&quot; Barack Obama has &quot;got planned. We already know his economic plan. It's designed to help small businesses that make under $250,000 a year. You know, like General Motors and Chrysler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; turns &quot;80 years old today. ... The first Mickey Mouse cartoon was called 'Steamboat Willie.' It premiered 80 years ago today at a 1928 fundraiser for young senator John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in Chicago,&quot; President-elect Obama &quot;met with former political rival John McCain.&quot; Both &quot;men said it was a relief to put their differences aside, sit down, and really make fun of Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush awarded, this is true, a National Medal of the Arts to Stan Lee, the comic book artist who created 'Spider-Man.' ... Yeah, afterwards, Bush said it's the first thing he's done as President that felt right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Hillary Clinton might&quot; be Barack Obama's &quot;Secretary of State.&quot; Hillary &quot;went from almost being the President to a secretary. It sounds like somebody needs to watch 'Working Girl' again because that's not how it's supposed to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secretary of State...travels all over the world, meeting with foreign leaders for weeks or sometimes months at a time, with long stretches of being away from his or her husband. But that's just a sacrifice Bill is willing to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost as if&quot; Bill Clinton &quot;told Obama, 'Listen, I'll campaign for you, I'll raise money, just get H-E-R the hell out of here, as far away as possible.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study from the University of the Maryland, unhappy people watch more TV. So, let me begin by saying...Republicans, how are you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three big domestic automakers are now saying they are working jointly on a new hybrid car. It runs on a combination of state and Federal bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the big debate in Washington, now, whether to bail out Detroit automakers. Because if they went under, we'd lose millions and millions of jobs. You know what we need to do? And this is what I think would work. We need to get Oprah to buy everybody a car again. That would turn this thing around!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three CEOs made a huge mistake today. You may have seen this -- they each flew to Washington in their own private jet to ask for $25 billion bailout. Even AIG executives are going, 'What are you thinking?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they each took their own private jet that cost $20,000 round trip. And here's the sad part -- today, the Japanese announced they have a jet that costs half that and gets better mileage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once he becomes president, Barack Obama will not be allowed to use his Blackberry or even his e-mail anymore for security reasons. Obama says, even if he can't e-mail, he still wants to be the first president to have a laptop on his desk in the Oval Office. See, Bush thought he had a laptop. Turns out it was just an Etch-a-Sketch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because he's a kind of a techno guy, the press is calling Obama the first 'wired' president, as opposed to President Bush, who was the first 'wiretap' president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda released a new tape today in which they used a racial slur directed at President-elect Barack Obama. Hey, al Qaeda...thought it was tough dealing with the US military? Now they've got Al Sharpton coming after them, all right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pirates from Somalia hijacked a Saudi Arabian super tanker full of oil and are holding it for ransom. You know what you call someone who hijacks a ton of oil, holds it for ransom? Anybody know? Exxon Mobil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't blame the pirates for robbing an oil tanker. Banks don't have any money any more. What are you going to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After his performance the other night, it looks like Lance Bass may win 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... That means we'll have a gay 'Dancing with the Stars' champion, an African-American president, and Hillary Clinton as secretary of State. You know, this could be just the thing that makes Rush Limbaugh's head explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it chilly outside today? ... I'm telling you, coming to work today, it was so cold, I was...shaking like Sarah Palin taking a geography test.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Auto executives, the Big Three, are asking Congress now for bailout money. Yeah. Hey, don't kid yourself. Things are getting desperate, and if they get any worse, these guys may have to trim their $10 million bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The annual 'People' magazine 'World's Sexiest Man' issue is on the stands today. Hugh Jackman, 'sexiest man alive.'&quot; But &quot;this is odd -- Al Franken is demanding a recount.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about Hillary Clinton? It looks like she'll be named Secretary of State. They're talking about that.&quot; And &quot;she'll also receive the home version of the presidency&quot; and &quot;some other wonderful prizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like those al Qaeda guys? They're creepy, aren't they, those al Qaeda guys?&quot; And &quot;they're taunting us now. And this guy, al-Zawahiri, he's like the second guy in charge, he released one of those wise guy, smart alecky audio tapes.&quot; In it, &quot;he condemns the United States, just flat, right across the board. And at the end, he wants to know if he can get some of that sweet Federal bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush daughters...invited the Barack kids to take a tour of the White House. That's sweet, don't you think? So the Bush girls are showing the Obama girls around,&quot; and &quot;at one point, one of the little Obama daughters&quot; saw &quot;something in the corner and said, 'Oh, you read comic books, too.' And the Bush twins said, 'No, those are Dad's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was another bad day for Alaska Senator and convicted felon Ted Stevens. He was officially declared the loser in his Senate race. But he's okay with it,&quot; because he &quot;wants to relax and spend time making shanks with his grandkids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the heads of GM, Ford, and Chrysler appeared together in front of Congress to ask for a $25 billion bailout. ... And here's what's interesting. When asked what they would do with the money, all three of them said, 'Buy a new BMW.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was a nice day. Barack Obama's daughters Malia and Sasha made their first visit to the White House.&quot; The &quot;girls were excited to see where they'll be living, and President Bush was excited to finally have somebody to play hide-and-seek with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John McCain met with his advisers to prepare to run for reelection to the Senate. Yeah. Apparently, McCain's new campaign slogan is, 'Now 100% Sarah Palin-free.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor yesterday was that Barack Obama would select Hillary Clinton to be his Secretary of State. Now it seems like that might not be the case and there are a lot of theories as to why. But maybe the best indicator that she might not take the job, apparently this morning, Bill took down his eHarmony page.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, the big auto show opens here in Los Angeles. It's $10 to get in, $25 billion to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story in Washington. Executives of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler testified on Capitol Hill, trying to get a $25 billion loan. President Bush was against the loan until Dick Cheney whispered in his ear, 'Cars use oil!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International maritime officials say 39 ships have been hijacked by pirates this year on the high seas. See, luckily, we don't have pirates in America that rob and plunder. We just have CEOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A postal worker in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been busted for smoking crack cocaine in her post office truck. ... Let me tell you something. If it speeds up the mail, fine with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a stunning announcement, the Office of the National Drug Control Policy reports that San Francisco now has more medical marijuana dispensaries than it does Starbucks. Well, yeah. That's because marijuana is a lot cheaper than Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little cold outside today, kids? Well, so much for your global warming, you know what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain&quot; announced &quot;today that he is beginning his 2010 senatorial campaign. And I'm thinking, wow! Two more years of a John McCain campaign, hey, cut me a slice of that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there are some nice aspects during the transition period. For example, the Bush twins&quot; gave &quot;the Obama girls a tour of the White House.&quot; It was &quot;very sweet,&quot; but the Obama girls &quot;got really scared because they heard creepy organ music coming from Cheney's underground lair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then the Bush twins grabbed a candle and took the kids on a tour&quot; of Cheney's &quot;torture chamber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton,&quot; what &quot;a stand-up guy. He went to Barack Obama and he said he will do anything to help Hillary become secretary of State. He said, 'Look, I'll remove my profile from eHarmony.com.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he's going to place all his interns in a blind trust.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some exciting television news. Tomorrow night,&quot; Ashley Dupre, who was involved with former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, &quot;will be interviewed tomorrow night on '20/20.'&quot; Unless &quot;of course she has to rush back to Washington to fix the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're...coming out of the last few weeks, days of the President Bush Administration,&quot; and &quot;President Bush is changing a lot of laws so you've got to keep your eye on him. And what he's doing now, one of the things that really upsets me, he's taken a lot of things, a lot of stuff, off the endangered species list. Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you like endangered species? Well, so I do. I had one for lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;I'll tell you, this&quot; taking things of the endangered species list &quot;is bad, it's really bad.&quot; In fact, it is &quot;really bad news for that thing on Donald Trump's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Vice President-elect Joe Biden's birthday today. And Barack Obama bought him 12 cupcakes for his birthday,&quot; which is &quot;a smart gift to give Biden because when his mouth is full of cupcakes he can't say anything stupid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The auto executives for the Big Three&quot; are &quot;being criticized now,&quot; because, before &quot;they asked Congress for billions of dollars, they all flew to Washington in private jets. Yeah, separately, in private jets.&quot; In &quot;their defense, the executives said, 'We would have driven, but our cars only get three miles to the gallon.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Missouri have finally finished counting the presidential ballots, and they say that John McCain won that state. ... As a result, Sarah Palin now thinks she's the Vice President of Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey just announced that she's planning to attend Barack Obama's inauguration. ... Oprah says she's very excited to see Obama become the second-most powerful person in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow took another major dive today. It lost 444 points. That adds up to 873 points over the last two days. The Dow is now dropping so frequently, they...decided to just add an n to the end of it and call it a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, UN officials said today they desperately need $7 billion to help people cope with disasters, but they're having a hard time getting people to send rescue money. Here's what the UN should do: Invest in bad mortgages; run a bank in to the ground; give yourself a bonus; get some spa treatments. In no time, the government will send you $750 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, General Motors announced they're selling two of their private jets. The bad news -- they're being bought by the executives of AIG.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it doesn't look like the automakers are going to get their bailout money. No, come on now. Congress said yesterday they're concerned with giving the Big Three automakers money just to keep making the stupid mistakes, you know. And believe me, when it comes to making the same stupid mistakes, Congress knows what it's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an editorial...this week, Mitt Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. He feels the car industry is not worth bailing out. Yeah. The only industries that Romney would bail out -- the tanning booth industry, tooth polishing industry, and the hair dye industry. Everything else can pretty much go to hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Obama transition team has leaked that his top choice for Homeland Security chief is Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano. First job, find out who leaked her name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's really strange is if she gets this,&quot; she &quot;would be the first official ever to take the job overseeing Homeland Security working for a guy, who if he wasn't President, whose name would be on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how out of it is President Bush? Today, they asked him what he thought about Napolitano? He said, 'It's delicious, especially the strawberry part.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell me this, is it me or is Barack Obama on the cover of, like, every magazine. ... I went to the newsstand today. Look at this. Here's Barack, cover of 'Time,' 'Men's Health,' 'GQ,' 'Tiger Beat.' Is he the fourth Jonas brother?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin pardoned a turkey, although she said she was amazed to find out that besides being a bird, Turkey is also a country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see that all over the Internet today? While Sarah Palin was pardoning a turkey, right behind her was a guy slaughtering turkeys. ... But see, like most Internet stories, a little half truth. Turns out after listening to Sarah Palin's voice, the turkey said, 'Uh, kill us now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll give you an idea of how bad the economy is. ... Saw Amy Winehouse today using Crack Helper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department stores, this holiday season,&quot; are &quot;laying off...Santa Clauses. So, more bad news for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is busy moving into the White House. Earlier today, John McCain was blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...may get a $7 million book deal.&quot; She is &quot;very excited because she claims she can see Barnes &amp; Noble from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she...got a tremendous deal. And she got a great guy working on the deal, Joe the agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanksgiving, just around the corner. You can tell it's Thanksgiving because they turn on the TV this morning, there is 'The Rachel Ray Show,'&quot; and &quot;there is Sarah Palin stuffing a moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, it's a great time of year to help the people less fortunate than we are. So this Thanksgiving, if you can, why not bring home a Lehman brother?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to senior senator from New York, Chuck Schumer. Today is Chuck Schumer's birthday. So that's why banks and schools are closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some fascinating historical info. On this date in 1620,&quot; pilgrims &quot;landed on Plymouth Rock&quot; and &quot;immediately applied for a government bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three auto companies in the United States&quot; are &quot;all scrambling to come up with a plan, some way to reinvent themselves. Well, this week Ford did its part. Ford unveiled a new hybrid, the Ford Fusion, which will get almost 40 miles to the gallon. ... Yeah, and when asked how much it would cost, a spokesman for Ford said, ' $25 billion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a New York elementary school became the first school in the country to be named after Barack Obama. ... Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, no one likes their team's new nickname, the Fighting Husseins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to some statistics the government released yesterday, Mexican immigration to the United States has dropped 42% over the last two years. And you have to hand it to President Bush, he knew that the way to stop people from sneaking into the country is not to build a fence or a wall, it's to make this country very undesirable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In political news, it looks like Hillary Clinton accepted Barack Obama's offer to be Secretary of State. ... She accepted after Barack Obama's vetting process could not find any link between her and Bill Clinton. So that worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another good day for the stock market. Up almost 400 points today. They said -- yeah, listen to this: 'If this keeps up every day for the next three years, we'll almost be even again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And talking about the economy over the weekend, Barack Obama says, 'There are no quick, easy fixes,' to which Amy Winehouse said, 'There are in my neighborhood.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the government is going to bail out Citigroup, yet they don't want to bail out the auto companies. See, I don't think this is fair. I mean, blue collar guys who make our cars, they don't get the bailout. But the white collar guys on Wall Street, they get the bailout. You know what I think we should do? I think they should work together. I think the guys in Detroit should keep making the cars, and the guys on Wall Street should be making the license plates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the car companies don't like the word 'bailout.' They prefer to call it 'a 24-hour bail-a-thon! Come on down! Everything must go! It is the big bail-a-thon!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the economic slowdown, in an attempt to save money, General Motors is ending their endorsement deal with Tiger Woods.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this pirate situation. Boy, that's getting more and more dangerous. See, today, a group of Somali pirates took over the boat of the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA now says their $154 million machine that converts urine into drinking water is not working properly. How would you like to be the astronaut that found that out?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Sarah Palin Excuses [For Turkey Pardoning Controversy]: &quot;10. 'I can see Russia, but I can't see what's going on five feet behind me.' 9.

'Those were Al Qaeda turkeys.' 5. 'I thought they were just torturing the little guy.' 4. 'I mean, doggonit, you know, like we have to lower taxes, and like, it all falls under job security, and we need to drill, you know?' 3. 'Uh, stomach flu?' 2. 'I'll get right back to ya! I'm still adorable, America.' 1. 'Don't blame me! Blame Joe the Turkey Slaughterer!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess&quot; Sarah Palin is back in Alaska, where she pardoned &quot;some turkeys&quot; for Thanksgiving. So &quot;she pardons them and then right behind her,&quot; someone kills some turkeys, and it &quot;was gruesome. I honestly haven't seen a slaughter like that since November 4.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard today that the federal government was raising, like, $40 billion to bail out Citigroup. ... Honestly, when you think about it, who doesn't really feel sorry for credit card companies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA has developed a urine machine&quot; that &quot;will convert urine into water. Well, guess what? It's on the blink. And you thought the coffee was bad where you work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And down in Washington, DC, the Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrived.&quot; And there is &quot;no surprise here. You know, they've got to decorate the tree.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The astronauts were very busy up in the space station today, installing a machine that converts their urine into drinking water. ... I'm thinking, astronauts drinking their urine? America's astronauts. Is the economy that bad?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, during the press conference, Obama told reporters that the economy is likely to get worse. ... After hearing this, John McCain said, 'That's funny. He didn't mention that during the campaign.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' I have some wonderful news for you. Everyone in our audience tonight is getting a Federal bailout. Congratulations!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President-elect Barack Obama announced his new economic team. You know what he should do? Hire those people who were in charge of his fundraising campaign. We can pay this thing off in like a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I was watching one of the network financial people on cable news today. And they said, with this bailout thing, the government has set a precedent that if you're a large corporation losing money, you know, due to lack of creativity and poor business decisions, well, the government will just send you a check. So, good news for NBC. We're getting a check! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's people are trying to lower expectations for the new Obama administration, you know, because everybody thinks he's going to be able to fix things all at once. So the expectations are very high,&quot; but if &quot;they want to lower expectations, quit hiring the Clinton people and keep some of those Bush people on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a political organization has filmed a new TV ad thanking Sarah Palin for all she did during the presidential campaign. Yeah. I believe the political organization is called the Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, because of the recent controversy, AIG, remember they got the big bailout, AIG? Well, they're now paying their CEO a salary, $1 a year. How many think that's fair? Yeah? How many still think he's overpaid?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, that's pretty good. I think that's a nice gesture,&quot; having the CEO &quot;work for just $1 a year. Oh, he'll still get his $300 million bonus,&quot; but the &quot;salary will be $1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is true, the Big Three automakers are now talking about driving back to Washington in December. Remember the big uproar last week&quot; when &quot;they all flew to Washington in private jets? Well, now they're going to carpool. No, this is true. And to make sure there aren't any problems, they're driving a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy is bad. ... In fact, today -- you know the White House turkey? Turned down the pardon. Said all his money's in the market. Nothing left to live for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an estimated 271 million turkeys were raised in United States this year. ... That's not even counting the turkeys&quot; that &quot;are here illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the astronauts aboard the space shuttle say they're still struggling with that machine they have&quot; that &quot;converts urine into drinking water. ... Well, that's got to be tricky, huh? How can you tell when urine goes bad? 'Hey, Bob, this urine taste funny to you? Taste it.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a way to conserve fresh drinking water, a number of conservation groups are now calling for an end to toilets that flush,&quot; to which &quot;gas station owners say, 'We are so ahead of you. We've been doing that for years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer planning to write a book offering advice to Barack Obama on the mistakes that have caused these severe economic problems that we have. And who better to get economic advice from&quot; than &quot;the guy who spent five grand an hour on a $200 hooker? ... That's like taking abstinence advice from John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs President Bush Doesn't Care Anymore: &quot;10. Hasn't taken off his Iron Man costume since Halloween. 9. The menu for the White House Thanksgiving dinner? Corn dogs and Beefaroni. 8. Drew a picture of Garfield on Dick Cheney's bald head. 7. He's barely trying to ruin the economy anymore. 6. Spent the entire weekend in the Oval Office pardoning himself. 5. Saw Osama at Arby's drive-thru but didn't feel like chasing him. 4. Spends cabinet meetings scanning classifieds for next job. 3. Primary focus is surpassing Hank Paulson's high score on 'Guitar Hero.' 2. Asking Obama, 'How soon can you bail me out of the White House?' 1. Started dating hefty interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, a guy in North Carolina, a mailman, a Federal employee, a postal worker, was arrested and put in jail. You know why? He would deliver regular mail, but he wouldn't deliver junk mail. They got the guy, they arrested him, and they put him in prison. We got that guy, but still no word on bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally we got some good news about the economy. Barack Obama got $800 billion to rescue the economy. ... All I can say is, 'Thank you, Oprah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Obama...is a smart, hard-working guy. And he has promised now to stabilize the economy, going to rebuild the infrastructure, create millions of new jobs, catch bin Laden. President Bush said, 'Uh, you can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have forgotten about President Bush, but this transitional period is a busy time for President Bush as well. He's busy granting pardons. ... Today, he pardoned Sarah Palin for her interview with Katie Couric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow,&quot; President Bush &quot;will...pardon&quot; turkeys. This &quot;year, I think you know the turkeys, the Lehman brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't like about the turkeys this year, they're arrogant. These turkeys that they're going to pardon this year, they're arrogant. They're flying in from Detroit on their private jets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But right now, right this very minute,&quot; Dick Cheney &quot;is waterboarding the turkeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin. Remember Sarah Palin? She is adorable. She is back on the campaign trail. Really. She's going to campaign in the Senate runoff in Georgia. As soon as she finds out where Georgia is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda has declared war on the Somali pirates. That is awesome! ... Evil against evil. Like Alien versus Predator&quot; or &quot;Cheney versus his lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech this morning, Barack Obama said, 'This isn't about big government or small government. It's about building a smarter government.' ... When he heard this, President Bush said, 'I get it. I get it. I'm leaving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, John McCain was in the news. John McCain gave his first press conference since the election. And he said, 'For a lot of people, Sarah Palin was an energizing factor during the campaign.' ... Unfortunately for McCain, those people are called Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's talking about the American auto industry right now. A new study just came out and found that the Ford Motor Company makes the cars with the highest safety rating. Of all the cars, yeah. Yeah, apparently, Ford cars are so safe because they never leave the dealer's lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that...the machine on board the International Space Station that turns urine into drinking water&quot; has &quot;been fixed. ... After hearing this, an astronaut said, 'Wait. You mean that wasn't lemon Tang?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Citibank says they will not be able to sponsor the New York Mets' new stadium because the bank's finances have collapsed. Yeah, the Mets are furious and said, 'Our sponsors don't collapse. We do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will tell you something, I will take money where I can get it. And I think...I'm coming into some dough by the end of the year. ... I bet a friend of mine that by New Year's Eve, the Dow Jones will be lower than my cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that Thanksgiving Day Parade. ... And of course, the culmination is the arrival of Santa and his elves.&quot; And &quot;tomorrow, as a matter of fact, they're going down to Washington to try to get some of that bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I have talked about this before, but Thanksgiving at the Letterman house&quot; is &quot;like a Guantanamo interrogation with pie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Donald trump? He had a great Thanksgiving. President Bush pardoned that thing on his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the day after Thanksgiving,&quot; is &quot;called Black Friday...because that's when the retailers go into the black&quot; and &quot;start turning a profit. ... People do a lot shopping on Black Friday, or as Sarah Palin calls it, Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who doesn't do well the day after Thanksgiving? Restaurants, because everyone's got food at home, everyone's got leftovers. ... The word leftovers comes from the Russian word leftov, which means warmed-over food. It doesn't really. I made that up. But I do that all the time. I'm like Wikipedia&quot; or &quot;Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of embarrassing for President Bush. This is true. This year, the White House Hanukkah cards they sent out&quot; had &quot;a Christmas tree on the front. ... And President Bush, very embarrassed by this. He said all the cards will be pulled and all of his Jewish friends will get a new card with a picture of the Hanukkah Bunny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In political news, President-elect Barack Obama has named Hillary Clinton as his Secretary of State.&quot; Speaking &quot;strictly as a late night talk show host, a Clinton back in office? Yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they said today during her confirmation hearings, Republicans could force&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;to answer a lot of embarrassing questions about Bill Clinton's financial affairs, to which Hillary said, 'What kind of affairs? Financial? Oh, no problem. Bring it on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And right wing pundit Ann Coulter has broken her jaw, and the doctor has wired it shut. ... He didn't wire it shut for medical reasons. He said it was the holidays, he wanted to do something nice for people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study in 'Psychology and Health Journal,'&quot; being &quot;religious may help extend your life.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of religion, Barack Obama still has not chosen a church to attend in Washington, DC. How hard could it be for him to find a reverend? How hard is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on 'Meet the Press' Sunday, First Lady Laura Bush said that the Obama girls, when they visited the White House,&quot; were &quot;schooled on all the fun things you could do there, like&quot; playing &quot;in an obstacle course,&quot; crawling &quot;under the furniture, and sliding down the ramp of the...solarium; all of the stuff President Bush likes to do now, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush opening up a little bit. He gave an interview to ABC News. Bush said he wished the intelligence on Iraq had been different. Hey, how many wish the intelligence in the White House had been different?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the space shuttle Endeavour landed in California on Sunday. To show you how bad the economy is, the astronauts were charged 15 bucks a bag.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has less than two months left before he two-steps back to Texas for some serious brush clearing time.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Labor Department announced that over 1,100 lawyers lost their jobs last month. ... So lawyers are losing their jobs,&quot; CEOs &quot;are being forced to work for a dollar a year,&quot; and &quot;Ann Coulter's jaw has been wired shut. In many ways, this could be the greatest Christmas ever when you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little bit of history trivia. It was this week, actually yesterday, in 1961,&quot; that Fidel Castro &quot;announced...he was a Marxist and would turn Cuba into a communist country where the government would take over all the major industries. Or as we call that today, a bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And AIG, you know the insurance company who's getting over $11 billion of our dollars in bailout money? Well, they announced they're giving 130 of their executives cash awards of up to $3 million. But they say, 'Oh, these are cash awards, not bonuses.' They say they are payments to guarantee that their top executives stay with the company. Oh, yeah, God forbid AIG should lose any of these business geniuses. Imagine...what kind of shape they'd be in without these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again, these are cash awards, not bonuses. So we should send them to jail, not prison, see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Wall Street experts are saying that there are incredible bargains right now in the stock markets. ... Oh, it's a great time to buy, yeah, like...after a huge car crash,&quot; when &quot;there are auto parts lying all around. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know by now, Barack Obama has officially named Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, which I think is a great idea. Because think about this. If anybody can bring peace to the Middle East, it's Hillary. I mean, think about it. She has proven over and over again you can live side by side with your biggest enemy and still make it work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I always love how pompous some of these meetings get. At the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Hong Kong yesterday, they...announced that everybody was served environmentally friendly bottled water made from condensed moisture in the air. Oh, shut up, okay.&quot; They &quot;put a bucket outside and collected rain water, okay, that's what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with President Bush just released this week,&quot; Bush &quot;says he wants to be remembered as the man who liberated 50 million people. Well, when you think about it, he did. I mean, thanks to him, 50 million Americans are now liberated from their savings account, their 401(k)s, car payments, mortgage...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss&quot; won &quot;the runoff election for the Senate seat for Georgia. Republicans think that Sarah Palin campaigning him for him helped him win. ... You know, this is the first candidate she's helped elect since, I guess, Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has declared a fiscal emergency here in California. I think that's what he said. He either said fiscal emergency or he said, 'I need a physical, I need some surgery.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning,&quot; President-elect Barack Obama &quot;nominated New Mexico Gov.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a difference a couple weeks make. You remember last month, the three auto company heads flew to Washington in private jets looking for the bailout? ... Well, this time, the three CEOs drove in their own hybrid cars.&quot; You &quot;know what I think the government should have done here? Make it like 'The Amazing Race.' You drop these guys off. No money, no transportation. Give them some tools. They have to build a car. The first one to Washington, they get the bailout!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that picture on the front page of the 'USA Today' yesterday of Arnold Schwarzenegger shaking hands with Barack Obama? Didn't it look like one of those ads for one of those bad buddy action movies from the '80s, you know? 'He's a strong man from Austria. He's an African-American from Chicago. They fight crime. They're Ebony and the Ivory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and his lovely wife Laura have purchased a new home in Dallas, Texas, worth $2 million. See, this is where president Bush has outsmarted everybody. People underestimate this guy. Five months ago, he would have had to pay 10 million bucks for that house, but thanks to his economic plan, he got it at a bargain. The man is a genius!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does that work when the President applies for a home loan? Like, when they do a credit check, do they include the trillion dollar deficit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Bush was awarded the International Medal of PEACE award. How did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some more bad news. NASA announced today that we are delaying our mission to Mars until 2012 because of the economic crisis. Yeah. Apparently, the dollar is really weak on Mars right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nearly two pounds of a green plant material found in a 2,700-year-old grave in the Gobi Desert has now been identified as the world's oldest marijuana stash. ... This beats the previous oldest stash found in Willie Nelson's tour bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last month the big story about all the money that the Republican National Committee spent on clothes for Sarah Palin and her family?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economy not looking good. Some bad job numbers. Employers cut over half a million jobs. This is the worst job loss in 34 years. The only bright side, at least Bush is losing his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And insiders say that President Bush and his wife Laura have already bought a home in Dallas, Texas, to move into after they leave the White House. And if this turns out to be true, this would be the first time in his Presidency he's actually had an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I tell you something. You can tell President Bush has been living in public housing a little too long. Like, when a reporter asked him if he was looking forward to escrow he said, 'You know, I don't like snails.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President-elect Barack Obama was on 'Meet the Press' yesterday, and he told the American people the economy was 'going to get worse before it gets better.' ... See, that's when you know the campaign is really over. Remember before the election? 'The audacity of hope!' 'Yes, we can!' 'A change we can believe in!' Now it's, 'We're all screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year the Treasury Department is holding its annual holiday party inside something called the cash room. ... That's a big room where the Treasury Department holds all its cash it has on hand. Of course, these days it's empty so plenty more room to party.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's more talk about a possible bailout for the auto industry. They went to Congress seeking $30 billion. The latest rumor is they might get about $15 billion. Well, they wanted 30, ended up with 15. Now they know how we feel when we buy a new car&quot; and &quot;we find out how many miles per gallon we're getting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Chris Dodd said the CEO of GM should resign as part of any bailout deal. His feeling is if you run up a giant deficit, and you don't give the American people what they want, you should resign. Wait, how did&quot; Dodd &quot;keep his job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' there's been an increase in violence in China because of a series of factory closings. Economists say if this trend continues the US might have to start manufacturing&quot; its &quot;own lead-based, contaminated products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Big Three, as you know,&quot; are &quot;not selling as many cars&quot; and they have &quot;got to pay those big union payments. So they went to the government&quot; looking &quot;for some of that sweet Federal bailout money.&quot; But instead &quot;of the bailout, they should apply for farm subsidies, you know, because of all the lemons they produced over the years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me just say a word about these jokes that I am telling right now, ladies and gentlemen. Like President-elect Obama says, 'It's going to get worse before it gets better.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Barack Obama, President-elect Barack Obama. ... Bush ought to take his last two months&quot; worth of &quot;paychecks and give them to Barack Obama, because he's working harder than the President. He's come up with a great initiative to create 2.5 million jobs for Americans. ... Kind of the catch is we all have to move to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something that is funny and also serious and not so funny at the same time but mostly funny. Barack Obama...smokes cigarettes. And he has tried to quit. And he quit but every now and then he's got to -- you know. ... It's hard to break old habits but it can be done. For an example, a couple of years ago, President Bush quit working. So, it can be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President-elect says that he still will smoke occasionally. ... And I remember on Election Day when he smoked John McCain, so it's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama says that sometimes the urge is so strong he really can't control himself and he just has to have one. And he -- no, wait, that was President Clinton. That's a different deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody in Detroit right now is hoping for a bailout for the auto industry. All of Detroit's consumed with this. And true story, it was in the news, this Sunday. In Detroit, a church put an SUV on stage in order to pray for a miracle for the Big Three automakers. ... And apparently, there was a miracle. Someone bought the SUV. At...factory price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, at a Kennedy Center Awards ceremony, Barbra Streisand kissed President George W. Bush. Yeah. The ultimate liberal kissed President George W. Bush. Yeah. Afterward, Bush said, 'Who was that guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President-elect Barack Obama and his family are going to spend the holidays in his home state of Hawaii.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden met with Al Gore in Chicago to discuss energy and climate change issues. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama says he is promising not to smoke cigarettes while in the White House. I don't know. Is that a big issue for the American people? Really? You care if he smokes? Let me tell you something, okay? If he fixes the economy, he can smoke a bong in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And voters in Louisiana, on Saturday, kicked out of office Democratic Senator William Jefferson. You remember this guy?&quot; He &quot;was indicted last year for having $90,000 in bribe money, in cash, in his freezer. Well, the voters kicked him out of office. How ironic is that? The only politician in Washington who actually saved some money. ... Make him treasury secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love New York City, especially at the holidays.&quot; And speaking of the holidays, today, &quot;Sarah Palin went out and shot a Norway spruce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a great story, because we had some trouble with our governor a couple of months ago, Governor Spitzer.&quot; Well, now, the &quot;governor of Illinois,&quot; Rod Blagojevich, has &quot;been arrested. ... He wanted $150,000 to name somebody to replace senator Barack Obama as the senator from Illinois. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. One count of bribery, also one count of fraud, and also one count of blagojeviching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spitzer was a lot more fun and a lot easier to say, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, when former New York Governor Elliott Spitzer heard about Governor Blagojevich, he said, 'Hey, you call that a scandal? No, I don't think so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the Big Three auto makers are going to get some bailout money. ... But the CEOs, these guys, they have promised when they get the bailout money, they can't use it to give themselves big, big year-end bonuses. They said, 'Well, no, of course not. That's what the employee pension funds are for.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, when the...Big Three&quot; CEOs went to Washington, they &quot;said, 'We've got to have... $25 billion. Congress said, 'You know what? Wait right here. Let me go to the back and talk to the manager.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our government right now&quot; is &quot;still trying to work out a bailout for the auto industry. ... Yesterday, President Bush said, 'It's hard to tell if a deal with the automakers is imminent.'&quot; Then &quot;Bush said, 'It's also hard to tell if the big hand's on the 11 or the 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some Senate leaders in Washington say they're...very close to reaching a bailout deal for the car companies.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story. Fran Drescher's in the news. Fran Drescher, who starred in 'The Nanny,' says she wants to be appointed to Hillary Clinton's senate seat. ... Unfortunately, the seat has already been promised to Mr. Belvedere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Senate seats, this morning, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was arrested by the FBI because he was trying to sell the Senate seat being vacated by Barack Obama. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Latest rumor in Washington is that President-elect Barack Obama may open up trade with Cuba.&quot; This &quot;is great news for anyone looking to buy a black-and-white television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's a heads up for you, especially if you're gay or work with gays. Tomorrow is the 'Day Without a Gay.' This is a real thing. A group of same-sex marriage supporters are encouraging people to call in gay tomorrow and skip work. The idea, I guess, is to show how much we rely on gays and lesbians in the workforce. And what better way to open closed minds than by forcing your co-workers to do your work for you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never called in gay. I've called in bi a few times. You get half the day off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no idea what relation&quot; the call-in campaign &quot;has to same-sex marriage, but, you know, with unemployment at a 15-year high, there has never been a better time to take the day off for no clear reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people in our studio got your seats tonight because you paid off Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something.&quot; You &quot;don't buy a Senate seat in this country. You take up donations. You go out. You lie to the American people. You make promises you are never going to keep. That's how you get a United States&quot; senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. Congress wants to appoint a government car czar to oversee the auto companies. Today, President Bush said, 'Car czar? Isn't he the president of Afghanistan?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Congress...wants to appoint someone to oversee the auto industry because they lack confidence that the car companies can solve the problem themselves. ... You know, the same way the Senate Budget Committee kept us within a budget, remember? And the way the banking committee kept the banks from failing. And the way the Senate Energy Committee made us energy independent. We need these kinds of oversights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love watching congressmen lecture auto executives on how to run their business? I mean, you got people that put us a trillion dollars in debt lecturing people who put us a billion dollars in debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said that he will not smoke cigarettes while he's in the Oval Office. He's kind of a closet smoker. So, he said he wouldn't smoke. And President Bush actually defended him today. President Bush said he smokes a cigar on rare occasions. He says it helps him think. Apparently it's a very rare occasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush talked about his religious believes on ABC's 'Nightline' the other night. When the host asked Bush if he was a literalist when it came to the bible, Bush said, no, no he's 'actually a Methodist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, in Hollywood, some same-sex marriage supporters urged people to call in gay and not go to work to show how much our country relies on the gay and lesbian people in the workforce. Interesting idea,&quot; but it kind &quot;of backfired here in Hollywood. When they called in, there was nobody there to answer the phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, how does that work? When you call in gay to take the day off, do you have to prove it? ... Do you have to have a note from another gay guy?&quot; Does the note have to be &quot;signed and...notarized by another gay person to make sure?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;today, Senator Larry Craig called in not gay. Actually, he tapped the message in code with his foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Hi, it's O.J. Wanna be cellmates?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Oh, I'm sorry, I think I have the wrong Blagojevich.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Hi, it's Larry Craig -- did I hear something about a Senator's seat being available?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'I'm calling about your Senate seat on Craigslist. Want to trade for a futon?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Hey, it's Cheney. Damn, even I think you're sleazy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'You really Blagojevich'd your political career.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'I'm guessing you didn't spend the bribe money on that haircut.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'It's Sarah Palin. Thanks for replacing me as the country's most embarrassing governor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks...excited about the holidays? ... Remember Sarah Palin? She is so excited about the holidays she held a press conference today to announce that from her house she can see the North Pole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not kidding about this economy,&quot; which &quot;is so bad that&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;had to mark down the price of a Senate seat 40%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did you hear about this guy?&quot; Blagojevich &quot;is charged with corruption and apparently&quot; he &quot;was stealing a lot of money, getting a lot of bribes&quot; and &quot;kickbacks and hiding them in his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...you know what he was doing? Because Barack Obama is the President-elect who used to be one of the senators from Illinois,&quot; Blagojevich &quot;has got to appoint a senator. So he was calling up people, saying, 'Would you like to be a senator. Well, what's it worth to you?'&quot; Well, &quot;I just hope to God this doesn't tarnish the fine reputation of Illinois politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news from Washington today. Even though it may make some people uncomfortable, President-elect Obama says he'll use his full name, Barack Hussein Obama, when he's sworn in next month. To show support, Joe Biden is also using his full name, Joseph Adolph Fidel Puppykiller Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not all bad news&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, because today is &quot;his birthday. ... If you want to get&quot; Blagojevich &quot;a present, you can't go wrong with a good lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama, today, called for&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;to resign. ... Blagojevich said, 'I'll do that if the price is right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Governor Blagojevich. Today -- coincidence -- today is his birthday. ... So for the second day in a row, Federal agents jumped out and yelled, 'Surprise!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the White House sent out a memo listing President Bush's successes and accomplishments. ... Actually, it's not so much a memo as it is a Post-it note.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A plan to bail out the Big Three automakers stalled in Congress today. Yeah. As a result, Congress plans to buy a better-built Japanese bailout plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is also in the news. As a protest against discriminatory marriage laws, gay rights groups are calling on gay people not to come to work today,&quot; which &quot;explains why my hair looks so bad tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was, in case you didn't know, what they called 'National Day Without a Gay.' The idea was that gays and lesbians were supposed to ? and this is a quote, 'call in gay to work' today,&quot; to &quot;show, I guess,&quot; their &quot;support for same-sex marriage. The point of the day...was to demonstrate what the world would be like without gays. It turned out it was exactly like the world with gays. No gay people participated in this. Because apparently they have jobs that they care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, it kind of had the reverse effect because one guy who works here had the flu today, and he came in anyway just to make sure we didn't get the wrong idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I myself was 15 minutes gay to work today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe the plumber is back in the news today. Joe...spent several weeks on a bus campaigning with John McCain,&quot; and &quot;he told Glenn Beck last night that he felt 'dirty' after discussing the issues with him. I don't know how to tell you this, Joe, but of course you felt dirty. You work in other people's toilets. You are dirty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Joe &quot;had praise for Sarah Palin. He called her 'the real deal.' They're perfect for each other, and in fact, they're starring in a new movie together. I don't know if you've heard,&quot; but &quot;it's called 'Dumb and Plumber.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you probably saw this on the news. A very embarrassing moment at the Illinois State Capitol today.&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;attended the opening of the nativity scene. And when the three wise men showed up with gifts for the baby Jesus,&quot; Blagojevich &quot;demanded half the loot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what sign&quot; Blagojevich &quot;was born under? 'For sale.' I believe that was the sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's getting pretty serious. President-elect Barack Obama has called for&quot; Blagojevich &quot;to resign, but he refused. He refused a directive from the next President of the United States, to which Hillary Clinton said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, the bad news for Governor Blagojevich is that there's no chance President Bush will pardon him because Bush can't even pronounce his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People close to the&quot; case talked about Blagojevich. They &quot;said that he was willing to do anything for money. That's why he was going to sell the Senate seat. See, that is so wrong. You know, in this country -- let me tell you something. If you want money, you do what everybody else does, okay? You go to Congress and you demand a bailout. That's what we do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this idea. Congress wants to promote a car czar to oversee the auto industry. You know, even if he's half as successful as Bill Bennett was as the drug czar, oh, our problems will be solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A car czar. What democracy has a czar?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The Washington Post,' during his eight years in office, President Bush spent 2,496 hours on the treadmill, elliptical machine, and mountain bike. And spent another 15 minutes working on the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A rare snowstorm hit New Orleans today. It snowed in New Orleans. You see that? Unbelievable. Not wasting any time, FEMA announced they will have plows in the New Orleans area within the next six to eight months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a little bit of history for you. It was on this day, in 1872, America's first black governor took office in Louisiana. Did you know that? ... Ironically, the man he beat out for the job, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview with ABC, President Bush said he is not a literalist when it comes to the Bible, or the Constitution either, for that matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, you know who is on the program tonight? Senator John McCain. ... Now he shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, he thinks the campaign is still going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're happy to have the Senator on the program. And if he does well on the program tonight, CBS might give him the 10:00 p.m. slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Golden Globe nominations out today,&quot; and &quot;Sarah Palin was nominated for&quot; one. Her category is &quot;Outstanding Comedy Performance in a Presidential Campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; what &quot;are you folks getting for Christmas? Well, I tell you what, Illinois is getting a new governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been doing some research into&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Have &quot;you seen this guy? ... Well, it turns out that thing on his head actually mated with that thing on Donald Trump's head. It's getting ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President-elect Barack Obama called on Illinois Governor Blagojevich to resign. ... And after...hearing this, Blagojevich said, 'If he wants to call and talk to me, it's $4.99 a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an article about President Bush's fitness routine that just came out, during his Presidency, Bush has spent 2,500 hours walking on a treadmill. Yeah. Bush said he only wanted to be on the treadmill for 45 minutes but he couldn't figure out how to turn it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama had another press conference today. Among other things, he talked about the economy.&quot; He &quot;says job prospects are worse than they have been in 26 years. This Obama is turning out to be a real bummer with these speeches, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has not been holding any press conferences lately. In fact, they just finished moving out of their campaign headquarters and are selling all their stuff. Really sad.&quot; McCain &quot;has gone from almost being president to holding a yard sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The Washington Post,' President Bush spent 2,496 hours on various exercise machines during his time in the White House. That's a lot. I guess during retirement he's just going to read a lot of classified memos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Republicans said today they want Bill Clinton to testify at Hillary Clinton's secretary of state confirmation hearing. And if he does testify, this could be the first time he can truthfully say under oath, 'I did not have sex with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says the budget crisis in California, only getting worse. He said it is so bad, we may have to start selling Senate seats here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early this morning, embattled&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;invited several ministers into his home.&quot; First, &quot;he prayed with them. And then, you know, out of force of habit, he tried to take up a collection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Time' magazine reports that Governor Blagojevich has an approval rating 4%.&quot; That &quot;with a margin of error of 5%. That means he could actually disapprove of himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And sources say that Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. is Senate candidate number five, whose emissary allegedly told Governor Blagojevich that, in return for Jesse being appointed as Barack Obama's replacement in the US Senate, the Governor would receive as much as $1 million. Now, if this turns out to be true, this could be the worst setback to the Jackson family since the invention of DNA paternity tests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, the other big question...about&quot; Governor Blagojevich is what's with his hair?&quot; It &quot;turns out, this is what he's been using. ... It's called Just For Corrupt Governors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, kind of an emergency today. There was smoke coming from the Capitol Visitors Center in Washington, DC, a small fire. So far, arson investigators have narrowed it down to three suspects -- head of General Motors, head of Chrysler, head of Ford. Could be any one of them!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the 'Los Angeles Times' reporting this week the latest trend is wedding cakes for dogs. ... More and more owners are holding wedding ceremonies for their dogs. You know, how does this make gay people feel? Huh? Oh, Prop 8, you can't get married. But a pit bull and a cocker spaniel? No problem. Oh, that won't ruin the sanctity. No, no problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me give you an idea...how cold it is here in New York City today. ... It's so cold today that Vice President Dick Cheney switched from water boarding to snowboarding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big film opened today. It's called 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.&quot; It is about an alien that comes to Earth &quot;looking for some of that sweet Federal bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know today, actually, five years ago tomorrow, I believe,&quot; they &quot;captured Saddam Hussein. ... You know who gets a really big kick out of that&quot; is &quot;bin Laden. He just thinks that's the funniest thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Barker turns 85 today. Happy birthday, Bob. ... Bob spent the entire day trying to guess the actual retail price of Barack Obama's senate seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm excited today...because there is a big movie opening.&quot; The &quot;Keanu Reeves movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still,'&quot; is opening, and it is &quot;a remake. The original movie is from the 1950's,&quot; so they have &quot;updated the aliens in the new movie.&quot; These &quot;aliens come to Earth and they are broke,&quot; so they &quot;demand a $500 billion bailout from the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news for the auto industry. ... Yesterday, the bailout for US automakers fell apart in Congress. Yeah. Yeah, apparently the bailout fell apart because it was designed by the same people who make the Chevy Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an article that just came out in a fitness magazine,&quot; President Bush &quot;often rides a stationary bike onboard Air Force One. That's true. Advisors say, 'He pedals really hard because he thinks he's powering the plane.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week,&quot; Illinois Governor Rob Blagojevich &quot;was accused of auctioning off a Senate seat to the highest bidder. Now his approval rating is at 8%.&quot; When &quot;he heard this, Blagojevich said, 'Eight? Do I hear a nine? 10? 11?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Vice President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month, he's going to have a new family member on hand ? a German shepherd puppy. Biden has had three German shepherds in the past. He likes them because...they're quick learners, which will come in handy because, as you know, the vice president's dog is always standing by in case President Obama's dog becomes incapacitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this particular dog is smarter than most. He's only a month old,&quot; but Biden has &quot;already...taught him a trick. He already learned how to put his foot in his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And not only will the new puppy serve as a pet, until he gets big enough to be home alone, he will also serve as the Vice President's toupee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks. Looks like we finally found something President Bush is good at: Dodgeball!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday in Iraq, President Bush was attacked by a shoe-icide bomber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was speaking at a news conference in Iraq when a journalist threw two shoes at him. ... You see what President Bush did? You see what he did to keep from being hit? Something he's never done before. Lean to the left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey! You got to admit, whatever you think of the guy,&quot; Bush has &quot;got good reflexes. Even Bill Clinton was impressed. You know, Clinton's an expert at ducking shoes, ashtrays, lamps, everything.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's my question, and no offense here. But where was the Secret Service? I mean, shouldn't they at least have jumped in front of the second shoe? ... See, that's when Bush realized he was on his way out, when the Secret Service is going, 'Yeah, we're guarding the new guy now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite part. ... On CNN, they brought in an expert on Iraqi culture. And he said, 'Let me clarify what happened here.' He said, 'In the Arab world, throwing your shoes at someone's head is considered an insult.' Oh, really? Really, as opposed to here in America, where it's a huge compliment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the interesting thing was the journalist who threw the shoe was immediately arrested, and then offered his own show on MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a teacher in England has been fired after she told a class of 7-year-olds there was no Santa Claus, which, ironically, is the same thing Congress told the automakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Bush Administration said they are ready to step in now and help the auto industry. And believe you me, whenever the Bush Administration gets involved in something, it is solved immediately. So, I think we'll be fine on that front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest talk is that Caroline Kennedy wants to be appointed to Hillary Clinton's senate seat. ... In fact, today, Caroline Kennedy got a call from Illinois Governor Roy Blagojevich saying, 'How much you willing to pay for it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a press conference this week, Jesse Jackson Jr., who is candidate number five&quot; for Barack Obama's old Senate seat, &quot;strongly denied he did anything wrong or improper. But now people are saying his brother might be involved. They say Jesse Jackson Jr. could be punished politically for what his brother did, to which Jeb Bush said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking on ABC's Sunday morning show 'This Week,' John McCain said that Sarah Palin could not necessarily count on his support if she runs for president in 2012. McCain said, &quot;We have some other great young governors out there.' Yeah, too bad he didn't pick one of them to run with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's Wall Street's latest scandal. It's only Monday. A man named Bernard Madoff,&quot; the &quot;former chairman of Nasdaq, has been arrested and confessed to Federal officials that he ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $50 billion. The name of the Ponzi scheme: Nasdaq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope things go better for Santa Claus this Christmas.&quot; Remember &quot;what happened last year? He was shot down over Alaska by Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, a church that Sarah Palin attended was burned. ... Very serious, disturbing,&quot; but &quot;they are looking for a&quot; suspect. They &quot;think it's Joe the arsonist. That's who they are looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush was in Baghdad...having a press conference,&quot; and a &quot;reporter from Iraq jumps up and starts heaving shoes at the guy. And in Iraqi, or Arabic, he starts screaming, 'Here's your farewell kiss, you dog!' ... I mean it was the same goodbye I got from NBC. Do you remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They arrested the guy and they're trying to find out if he is a Shoe-ni or a Shoe-ite. My five-year-old is also writing jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's the same old story. You hear this over and over again. A guy, a crazy guy, goes into a Payless store, purchases a pair of Rockport shoes, and they didn't even do a background check on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you've got to give Bush credit. I mean, the guy moved pretty quickly. ... He reacted pretty good.&quot; Too &quot;bad he didn't react that way with bin Laden or Katrina or bin Laden or the mortgage crisis or bin Laden or Afghanistan or bin Laden or the Lehman Brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, it was a bit of a press conference and he was over there for his farewell thing and the guy is lobbing&quot; shoes. Bush did &quot;pretty good, though. I don't think Bush really has dodged anything like that since the Vietnam War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who it is a great day for?&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who &quot;still has his job. He didn't resign. Everyone thought he would. Looks like his plan is to keep hanging on, even though the game is over. Political experts call this strategy 'the Hillary Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story over the weekend is that President Bush had that press conference in Iraq, which turned into 'Shoe-pocalypse Now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a journalist throws his shoes at the President,&quot; if &quot;you're a late night talk show host, you go, 'Aaahhh!' Good times. It's like when Cheney shot his lawyer. You go: 'Aaaahhhh! Well, that's tonight's show taken care of.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush was amazing. You see how quickly Bush got out of the way? ... Bush has been accused of dodging issues in the past, but who knew he could actually dodge shoes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush is &quot;62 years old, but&quot; he &quot;still has the reflexes of a cat. Mind you, I think his head has been on a swivel ever since Cheney shot his lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the shoe-throwing incident has made Sarah Palin want to be president even more. 'Free shoes? You betcha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the conspiracy theories have begun. ... Oliver Stone is already making a movie about the shoe-throwing incident. He thinks there was a second shoe-thrower, because...that journalist threw two shoes in four seconds. That's impossible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The irony of all of this is of course that this shoe-throwing incident is as close as we'll ever get to finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoe-throwing journalist has got his supporters because today in&quot; Iraq, &quot;thousands of people took to the streets. They were all chanting in unison all day long. And do you know what they were chanting? Now I'm not making this up. ... They were chanting, 'Bush, Bush listen well, two shoes on your head!' Well, I think the President must be devastated by that. If...John Kerry had used that chant four years ago, he would have won!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of chant is that? ... If there's an Iraqi Doctor Seuss, he must be...terrible. 'One fish, two fish, seven dogs run on a lawn.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bright side to all of this is the Iraqi economy must be going well if a guy can afford to throw a perfectly good pair of shoes. Journalists over here can't even afford a pair of flip-flops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoe-throwing journalist is in jail.&quot; He &quot;didn't think this through, though. I mean, if you're a journalist and you're unhappy with a politician, why don't you just write something down? You're a journalist! You can even get it printed in a newspaper! Doesn't he know that the pen is mightier than the shoe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at a press conference in Baghdad, an angry Iraqi threw his shoes at President Bush's head. ... Yeah, when he saw the shoes, President Bush said, 'See, I knew you guys had weapons of mass destruction.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the man -- this is true -- the man who threw his shoes at President Bush is being hailed as a hero in Iraq. Yeah. In fact, when he dies, he'll be greeted in heaven by 72 podiatrists.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rough weather in a lot of the country. Ice storms in the Northeast&quot; and a &quot;cold snap in the Midwest. In fact, it was so cold in Chicago&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;actually had his hands in his own pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the weather was so bad in Washington people were throwing snowshoes at President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Bush Administration has a new slogan: 'Duck!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush took a surprise trip to Baghdad over the weekend and at a press conference with the Iraqi premiere, a reporter threw his shoes at him.&quot; This &quot;guy was so angry&quot; and &quot;so anti-Bush, at first people just assumed he was an American journalist, but no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;to give you an idea how bad the economy is in Iraq, the shoes that were thrown at Bush came from Payless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's not just President Bush. Today somebody threw a pair of shoes at Sarah Palin. And she was very upset. She said, 'Do you have these in black?' And threw them back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is the big news in New York. Well, all over the world, really. It's just an amazing story. A Wall Street tycoon named Bernard Madoff has been arrested for running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. ... You know what a Ponzi scheme is? That's where they use the money of new investors to pay off the older investors, or as we call it, Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell, President Bush, you know, he's not a financial guy. He doesn't...understand anything. Like, when they tried to explain the Ponzi scheme, he said, 'Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Ponzi? You're confusing two people. It's either Potsy or Fonzi. There's no Ponzi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the economy is in bad shape, but I tell you, there are some great deals out there. There are still bargains, you know. I went shopping over the weekend. I got an Illinois senate seat, $149,&quot; marked &quot;down from half a million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in New Jersey, the state Senate is working on a bill to legalize medical marijuana. They say it's the one thing that could actually ease the pain of having to live in New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a big surprise on the Sunday morning news shows. Senator John McCain said he may not support Sarah Palin if she's around in 2012. Of course, the bigger question, will McCain be around in 2012?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Carrey on the show tonight.&quot; He has a &quot;new movie&quot; coming out &quot;called 'Yes Man,' about a guy who has to say yes to everything. I think it's the story of Governor Blagojevich. 'Bribes?' 'Yes.' 'Corruption?' 'Yes.' 'Screw the public?' 'Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich is &quot;refusing to step down,&quot; and he is &quot;still up to his old tricks. This guy hasn't learned anything. Did you see him leaving his lawyer's office yesterday? ... Ellen, show the back of his car as he's pulling away. Look at this. Look at this sign. Look at this. 'Buy A Senate Seat. Ask Me How.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that guy that heaved his shoes at the President? ... And of course, everybody is saying, 'Well, what happened to the Secret Service?' Good question. 'Where is the Secret Service?' I mean, from now on, 'All right, take off your shoes.' It's going to be that. 'You want to see the President? All right, slip out of those shoes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out this guy was...described as a hot head.&quot; He &quot;is an Iraqi journalist and they say he's a hot head with poor...journalistic skills. ... Well, no surprise, today he was offered his own show on Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I've got to give President Bush credit for this because he's taking it all pretty well. He says he's actually happy about the shoe-throwing episode because he says it proves finally that Iraq does, in fact, possess footwear of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Electoral College has officially elected Barack Obama as President of the United States. ... I don't know anything about politics or elections, but...it's really starting to look bad for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is having a lot of press conferences. He's having, like, one a week and he's got one tomorrow.&quot; And &quot;he's going to be announcing Leno's new 10:00 p.m. format, so that'll be tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't avoid how I'm opening tonight's show, because everyone's still talking about the shoe-throwing incident with our President.&quot; It has &quot;gripped the nation. It really has. And, well, today, President Bush told reporters, because he's still talking about it, and he said that the shoe-throwing incident was one of the weirdest moments of his Presidency. ... Bush said the only thing weirder was the time he got re-elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are criticizing the Secret Service because the shoe thrower caught them off guard. The man was able to throw a second shoe. Yeah. A spokesman for the Secret Service said, 'Sorry, but we were laughing our a $#es off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Administration of course is winding down, not just President Bush, but everybody is sort of talking about the eight years. Yesterday, Dick Cheney was interviewed by ABC News and he reflected on his eight years in office. Yeah. Then he turned into a bat and disappeared in a puff of smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;State of California's having some trouble. State of California, worried about pollution. That's right. But they're on the case. Earlier today, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that his state needs to 'reduce toxic substances.' Yeah. Of course, when Arnold said it, it sounded like 'ragu taco submarines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you have seen this by now. On Sunday, President Bush made the last stop on his farewell tour of Iraq.&quot; While there, a &quot;reporter...threw his shoes at him. Apparently, touching or hitting someone with your shoe is the most insulting thing you can do in&quot; Iraq, &quot;short of beheading, I mean, which they do. That's the worst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have to say, I was impressed by how nimbly President Bush was able to dodge those shoes. I mean, I know he's got a lot of dodging experience from his years during the Vietnam War, but this was pretty slick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who threw the shoes is now a hero in Iraq. They say he's shown the world that Iraqis have no masters, but I think what he really showed the world is that Iraqis have no aim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, this is the country we thought had nuclear weapons.&quot; Instead, it &quot;turns out...they have a pair of size 9 Hush Puppies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the other night president Bush hosted his final White House Hanukkah party. Now, even though it's a week early, he wanted to light the menorah.&quot; Now if &quot;you're...not familiar&quot; with the holiday, &quot;Hanukkah celebrates the miracle of when only a tiny amount of oil burned for eight days. Sounds like Exxon Mobil's worst nightmare, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced before he leaves office, he wants to visit the poorest regions of the world. You know, any place where people can't afford to buy shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush the other day said he planned his attack for months. Planned it for months? ... I mean, take off one shoe, you throw it. 'Oh!' you throw the other shoe,&quot; but he had to plan this &quot;for months. And he still missed both times!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the guy is being called a hero in the Arab world. So, he has this plan and it's a failure and he's a hero. You know, if that's the standard, Bush should be the biggest hero in the Arab world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's picked another Cabinet member, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, to be his agricultural secretary. Vilsack. Now doesn't that sound like a condition you should see your urologist about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made a surprise visit to Detroit today. I don't want to say that people in Detroit are upset with him, but I understand auto workers threw brake shoes at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Keanu Reeves' new science-fiction remake of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'&quot; is &quot;number one, making $31 million. It's about a robot who comes to Earth to warn everyone about the consequences of humans destroying the Earth? Didn't they&quot; already &quot;make a movie about a robot warning humans?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Dick Cheney said that we made the right decision to go to war in Iraq. And I said to myself, 'Well, that's good enough for me, by God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this guy in -- George Bush is over there in Baghdad saying goodbye to the troops,&quot; and this Iraqi journalist &quot;heaves a couple shoes at&quot; the President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody looks forward to 'Time' magazine naming their 'person of the year.' And today, they named Barack Obama person of the year. ... That's right. Finally, things are starting to go his way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin also honored today.&quot; She was named &quot;'person of the year' by LensCrafters. And in about an hour, they'll name somebody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that the Iraqi journalist who threw the shoes at President Bush had his arm broken when security subdued him. ... And even worse, it was his shoe-throwing arm. That guy is out for the season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, in a recent interview, President Bush said that he has a collection of over 250 autographed baseballs. Yeah. Unfortunately, the question the interviewer asked was do you have an exit strategy for Iraq?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Illinois Supreme Court refused to hear a motion to throw&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;out of office. Yeah. Afterwards, Blagojevich thanked the supreme court and said, 'Your check is in the mail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Dick Cheney was interviewed by ABC News and he said that he will miss being Vice President. Yeah. Yeah. Then he said, 'And I'll really miss being President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it snowed in Malibu. That is unbelievable, isn't it? Yeah. Five inches of snow in Malibu,&quot; where &quot;people aren't used to snow. They were trying to snort it. They didn't understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Barstow, people were really excited. It never snows there. They were going, 'It's raining crystal meth! We can't believe it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big financial story, Bernard Madoff, the man they call the most hated man in New York, as you know, has been arrested after confessing to running this Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of $50 billion. That's almost hard to believe. But the good news, today he was named AIG's man of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what's being called a once-in-a-decade storm, it snowed in Malibu the other night. A lot of celebrities actually snowed-in in Malibu. Isn't that amazing? You thought it took President Bush a long time to send help to New Orleans, how long is it going to take to rescue Barbra Streisand?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, Dick Cheney couldn't decide whether to go snowboarding or waterboarding. He didn't know which one was more fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich came out and spoke to the press. He said he has done nothing wrong and he is not guilty of anything. There. So that's the second big snow job Chicago's gotten this week. That's two. No, the first thing he said to reporters was, 'I'm dying to answer your questions and show you how innocent I am.' And then he split. That's what he did. He said that powerful forces are against me. Yeah, I think they're reality, honesty, and a big-boy style haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unemployment nearing record highs, the economy is in collapse, the Big Three automakers are near bankruptcy, Senate seats are being sold. But today Congress took action. You know what they did? Gave themselves a pay raise. God bless them. A job well done. Yeah. 4,700 bucks each. They gave themselves a raise today. Isn't that amazing? But in their defense, members of Congress, they have expenses the rest of us don't have -- defense lawyers, bartenders, mistresses, these things all cost money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House announced a $13.4 billion rescue package for the troubled Detroit automakers. It allows them to avoid bankruptcy. But Bush had one major condition for the bailout. He had one stipulation. He said he wanted one of those cool Trans-Ams with the eagle on the hood.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A headline in today's newspaper, an interview, 'President Bush looking back on his terms in office.' He said he didn't strive to be popular. That's what he said. He didn't strive to be popular. So, to use his own words ? 'mission accomplished.' Hell of a job. And how about this? An Egyptian man has offered his 20-year-old daughter to the Iraqi guy who threw his shoes at President Bush. Yeah, offered the man his 20-year-old daughter as a gift. Hey, you thought people were throwing shoes at Bush before. You know, that journalist that threw the shoes, he's gone from obscurity to being a huge overnight celebrity in the Arab world. He's huge. In fact, over there he's known as 'Ahmed the Plumber.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more problems for Alaska governor Sarah Palin. You hear about -- you didn't hear about this. Alaskan state troopers have arrested the mother of Bristol Palin's boyfriend. Arrested the boyfriend's mother on drug charges. They got suspicious she might be using drugs when she said she could see purple unicorns from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York Governor David Paterson has unveiled a huge number of new taxes for New Yorkers. It is 88 new taxes if you live in New York. Taxes on soda, movie theater tickets, sporting events, taxis, buses, limos, cable TV. Is that the right thing to do, tax working people? You know what they need to do? How about a nice big Lehman Brothers or AIG incompetence tax? You know, one big tax, cover everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was speaking about his presidency, his legacy. He made a speech this week and said 'I didn't compromise my soul to be a popular guy.' Dick Cheney responded 'what's a soul? Oh, that thing I gave to the Dark Lord.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Obama made a huge announcement this week. He's going to travel to his inauguration by train. I know! This is a big surprise because everybody thought Obama was going to get to the inauguration by walking on water but apparently he is taking the train. I think this is inspiring instead of 'I think I can, I think I can, I think I can' Barack Obama's train goes 'yes we can, yes we can.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama says the train thing is his idea, but I think it's Biden's idea. He loves trains. He never shuts up about them. 'I take the train every day to work. My father went to work on a train. My father was a train, his father before him was a train. Everybody in my family is all made of trains. I like Biden but let's be honest, he's crazy. He's like you know in The Lion King? You know that hyena Ed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm making fun of Biden but I can't imagine Dick Cheney taking the train. I can imagine him tying someone up on the tracks in front of a train.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama says he is traveling by train because trains are a symbol of America's history. Also, the federal government is out of money and can't afford plane tickets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush hosted the annual White House Hanukkah party and the opening prayer was delivered by a rabbi. Or as Bush kept calling him, Jewish Santa..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Oprah Winfrey is not only planning to attend Barack Obama's inauguration, she says she's currently looking for a house to buy in Washington, D.C. She's going to buy a house there,. Oprah said she's found a nice little cottage at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Donald Trump was asked what he thought about the recently arrested Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff, and Trump called him a disgrace and a sleaze bag. Then Trump cast him in the next season of 'The Apprentice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold in New York City, Bernard Madoff asked if he could actually go to hell earlier, just to warm up. .. Bernard Madoff swindled investors out of $50 billion in a Ponzi scheme. It's unbelievable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though major banks have received hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in bailout money, the CEOs will not give an accounting of how the money is spent or where it went. Hello? Isn't that how we got in trouble the first place? Can we hire a few accountants with some of that dough, please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Karen Mills to head up the Small Business Administration.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday on '60 Minutes,' California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would like to be president. I think that's what he said. Or he said, 'I want to buy some presidents -- to put under the tree -- such as that.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'In a recent interview, President Bush says that he's already begun thinking about his farewell speech. Yeah, which means he's only two years behind most Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'Wall Street Journal,' this is interesting, many of the people Barack Obama has appointed to his cabinet are excellent basketball players. Except for Hillary Clinton, who prefers lacrosse or field hockey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The largest donor at the Clinton library turns out to be Saudi Arabia. Yeah. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;NBC is showing, once again, the classic movie 'It's a Wonderful Life.' See, it is so different today. See, when they made that movie, back then, the government actually asked banks to account for what money was missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have been off since Christmas. You know, I was out of the country. Not the best vacation,&quot; because &quot;I have a timeshare in Gaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, as you know, Israel is at war with Hamas. Israel said the reason they attacked Gaza was they were sick of being hit by Palestinian missiles. And you know who's really tired of it? The manager of the Target store in Jerusalem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a special holiday message was delivered by the Iranian president.&quot; It &quot;aired on British TV Christmas Day,&quot; and &quot;in this message, the Iranian president...said that if Jesus were alive today, he would be standing next to him. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure Jesus would be wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' t-shirt, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congress says this week they are looking into...this Bernard Madoff scandal.&quot; So &quot;The guy that made $50 billion disappear is being investigated by the people who made $750 billion disappear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush has signed a deal to write her memoirs. ... We have an advance copy right here. It's called, 'Another Book My Husband Won't Read.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the next two weeks, President-elect Barack Obama will be living full-time at a hotel right across the street from the White House. This is historic because this is the first time a Democrat has checked into Washington hotel room under his own name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama spent his first full day in Washington since coming back from&quot; his vacation in Hawaii, but &quot;no matter where this guy is, he always manages to work out. ... Like, today, he spent most of the afternoon running from Bill Richardson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson announced this weekend that he is withdrawing his nomination to be Commerce Secretary because of a grand jury investigation involving some of his political donors. And once again, President Bush, not really following this story. Like, when he heard there was a problem with the governor of New Mexico, he said, 'Well, he should be deported.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Gov. Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol,&quot; who &quot;had her baby. They named the baby Tripp,&quot; which &quot;is better than the name Sarah Palin suggested. She wanted to call the kid Joe the baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, guess what, we have an acorn shortage,&quot; and it is &quot;so serious, this acorn shortage, squirrels are asking for a government bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let me...know what you think of this. George Herbert Walker Bush...says that&quot; his son, Jeb, &quot;would make a great president. And I'm thinking, a third Bush in the White House. Boy, cut me a slice of that, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill and Hillary Clinton&quot; helped drop &quot;the ball in Times Square&quot; on New Year's Eve. But &quot;it was frigid. It was bitter cold, it was icy.&quot; And &quot;that's just their marriage, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were on vacation last week,&quot; and so &quot;much happened while I was away. Sarah Palin became a grandmother. She's been helping out with all the diaper changes. It's like she's back campaigning with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new year's been tough on John McCain. He's still writing 1908 on his checks. It is very difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama said he got a little choked up as he left his house in Chicago and headed for Washington, DC. ... It was especially painful because as soon as he left,&quot; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;sold Obama's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Barack Obama's daughters started at their new school in Washington, DC. ... Yeah, their teachers are really impressed and said that both girls are already reading well above President Bush level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush Sr. recently said he'd like his son Jeb to be president, but that right now is a bad time for him to run. ... When asked what a good time would be, Bush Sr. said, 'Eight years ago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this in the paper? In an interview with 'The Washington Times,' Vice President Dick Cheney said he is not a big fan of rap music. You could have knocked me over with a feather. I was stunned by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I'm surprised. I mean, look at the guy.&quot; Cheney &quot;gets driven around in a limo, he's surrounded by body guards, shot a guy in the face -- he is a rap star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on. Unemployment is up again, especially if you're the new senator from Illinois trying to go to work.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today on Capitol Hill, Roland Burris,&quot; who was appointed by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;to fill Barack Obama's seat,&quot; was &quot;turned away and denied his seat in the Senate. ... And the sad thing is this Burris guy is kind of caught in the middle of this whole thing. Because legal analysts say in appointing the senator, Blagojevich may have actually acted legally. He may have acted legally. God, there's a first time for everything, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, I love this part. He was turned away because they said he didn't meet the high standards of the Senate. Gee, I wonder which senator turned him down. Do you think it was the one who embezzled the money? Maybe it was the one who got caught with the hooker?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama has now named former Clinton chief of staff Leon Panetta to be his director of the CIA. But a lot of senators are criticizing this because they say Panetta is not an intelligence professional. You know, like President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview over the weekend, President Bush revealed that he has a prized collection of over 250 autographed baseballs, which would be very impressive if he were 10.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the FDA has approved a new drug that will give people longer eyelashes. ... Well, thank God we are not wasting time and money on cancer research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the World Health Organization announced that there is a new outbreak of the bird flu. They're warning people not to pick up any dead birds you see lying on the ground. Well, there goes my weekend!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of environmentalists are now urging people, if you eat meat, to switch from eating hamburgers to eating kangaroo burgers. ... They say kangaroo meat is better for the environment, and each burger has a little pouch to keep the fries in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 2001,&quot; George W. Bush was &quot;certified as the winner of the 2000 presidential election. How about that? That turned out pretty well, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, First Lady Laura Bush...is writing a memoir.&quot; The &quot;name of the memoir, I believe, is 'I'm With Stupid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Bush is hosting a White House lunch for President-elect Barack Obama, former President Jimmy Carter and former President Bill Clinton. ... At least that's what Bill is telling Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new survey indicates that Barack Obama is the most admired man in America. ... But I'm also on the list, thank you...very much. I'm a little farther down. I'm between Richard Simmons and Bernie Madoff. But I'm on the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secret Service has unveiled a new state-of-the-art limousine for Barack Obama. A million dollars for this state-of-the-art limousine. Meanwhile, today, John McCain closed a deal on a used LeSabre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Obama's &quot;limousine...is massive. It's a three-ton, tank-like vehicle, or as GM calls it,&quot; a &quot;compact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's good news for Obama. The new tank-like limousine is shoe proof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; President-elect Barack Obama &quot;described the economy as 'very sick.' ... Historians say it was a childish way to describe a complex problem but still the smartest thing they've heard a president say in eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress was sworn in this morning. And 'USA Today' says that the average age of the members makes it the oldest Congress ever. Yeah, which explains why today, they passed three bills and four gallstones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A plastic surgeon here in the United States has rigged his car so that it runs on fat left over from liposuction. ... That's right, Middle East, a car that runs on fat. Now who has the greatest energy reserves in the world? USA! USA!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Social Security Administration just announced that people can now register for their retirement online, and it only takes 15 minutes. Yeah. Or for senior citizens, an hour and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi,&quot; there, &quot;I'm Jimmy,&quot; the &quot;host of the show. And I'm honored to have been appointed the new junior senator from the state of Illinois. ... Funny thing is, I'm still writing 2008 on the checks I sent&quot; to Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin, I want to apologize to our audience. We had to turn away almost 100 people tonight. Yeah. Seems they all got their seats from Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Blagojevich is in trouble for allegedly trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama. And in an interview today, Blagojevich...said, 'If what I've done is impeachable, then I'm on the wrong planet.' ... That would explain the Klingon helmet hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it looks like Roland Burris will get his Senate seat, but Senate leaders said not until his certificate is signed by the Illinois secretary of state. They say this has been the rule since 1884&quot; and they have &quot;never, ever wavered from this. Of course, over the past eight years, they've waved rules against, you know, torture and spying on Americans and violating the Constitution, but never the little signature.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted Barack Obama and all three living former presidents at the White House today.&quot; But &quot;there was one awkward moment when President Bush asked all the other former presidents, 'Don't you hate it when your approval rating goes below 50%? Isn't that -- oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Bush keeps giving interviews about his eight years as President. Earlier this week, he said his greatest accomplishment...was his effort to privatize Social Security, even though he never actually did it. That's President Bush, isn't it? Your greatest accomplishment? Well, there aren't any. But if there were, by golly, here's what it would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I think&quot; President Bush is struggling &quot;to come up with some accomplishments. ... Like today, he took credit for ending the drought in New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something good&quot; President Bush has done. This &quot;is actually quite good.&quot; He &quot;has declared three Pacific Ocean regions as national monuments, making it the largest marine reserve on the planet. ... And they are now totally protected. Unless, of course, somebody finds oil. Then all bets are off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Joe the plumber? ... He's back. He's now going to the Mideast as a war correspondent for a conservative website. See, now, like you people, I'm going, 'Why, why?' I mean, on one hand, he's not really a war correspondent. On the other hand, he wasn't really a plumber either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse -- I mentioned this the other night -- a guy named Alex Haines, says that Amy smokes crack for breakfast. ... That's pretty bizarre, don't you think, smoking crack for breakfast? Although surprisingly, nutritionists say it's still better for you than Pop-Tarts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At The Presidents' Lunch: &quot;10. 'Sorry, you're not on the list, Mr. Gore.&quot; 9. 'If Hillary calls, I've been here since Monday.' 8. 'Laura! More Mountain Dew!' 7. 'You guys wanna see, 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop.&quot; 6. 'Call the nurse -- George swallowed a napkin ring!' 5. 'Hey Barack, wanna go with us to Cabo in March? Oh that's right, you have to work!' 4. 'Kissey kissey.' 3. 'Obama? I think he's downstairs smoking a butt.' 2. 'Did you ever see a monkey sneezing?' 1. 'I hope Clinton's unbuckling his belt because he's full.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic day down in Washington&quot; because &quot;five living presidents had lunch together.&quot; Herbert Walker Bush, &quot;George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, all at the White House, all having lunch. What a day. And while this was going on, John McCain was at Appleby's blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the lunch went well. Only three shoes thrown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush picked up the check. Bill Clinton picked up the waitress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're just a couple of weeks from new President Barack Obama being sworn in. And he's been very busy&quot; naming &quot;a lot of cabinet positions. And today he announced that he wants the surgeon general...to be TV Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ... That was the kid on 'American Idol,' wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But surgeon general, that's a tough position, and it was hard for Obama to make the choice. It was between Gupta, Dr. Phil and a guy on 'Scrubs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States Army announced that they will accept overweight recruits. ... So now when a soldier is AWOL, it means he's at Wendy's ordering lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that you're an overweight recruit in the Army when you see a Domino's guy crawl into your foxhole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President-elect Barack Obama had lunch at the White House with all the living US presidents. Obama called the meeting an 'extraordinary gathering.' ... In a related story, John McCain had lunch at Quiznos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is true, though, that&quot; President Bush and President-elect Barack Obama had &quot;an historic lunch with the three former presidents. Yeah. Of course, Bill Clinton was the only one who brought a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Inauguration Day, Barack Obama, this was just announced, is going to be riding in a brand new...presidential limousine made by General Motors. Because, folks, nothing says hope for the future like General Motors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;The Washington Post'...reports today that Barack Obama wants to appoint CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta to be surgeon general. ... Obama said the CNN doctor must be pretty good because he's kept Larry King alive all these years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some political experts were really surprised that Obama's pick for surgeon general is mainly known for talking about health care on television, but apparently Obama got the idea from President Bush, who once tried to appoint the cast of 'Scrubs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, it was an historic day -- I think that's the right way to say it, in Washington, as all four living presidents and our president-elect had lunch together at the White House. Presidents Clinton, Carter, both Bushes, and Barack Obama sat down to share a meal. President Bush was especially excited. It's his place, and...when the guys all walked in, he went, 'Hey, you're the guys from the paintings in my office.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only did the former presidents give Obama advice, but this is...pretty amazing. They announced a plan to solve all the world's problems by joining forces to form one giant President Voltron,&quot; which &quot;will destroy all who oppose us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was a historic meeting in Washington this week. Yesterday, Barack Obama and all the former US presidents met at the Oval Office. Did you see it? All the living ex-presidents were there. Jimmy Carter, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney. All of them were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, you know, being president-elect is kind of awkward because Barack Obama didn't have any experiences or accomplishments to talk about as president.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Activists are now pressuring President-elect Obama to make good on his pledge to end the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy in the military to allow gays to openly serve in the military. You know, I think it's about time. Don't you? Let me tell you something, if someone is willing to risk their life for our country, they should be...able&quot; to &quot;watch 'Dancing with the Stars' openly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the World Health Organization announced this week a new outbreak of the bird flu. Quite serious. The bird flu is the most threatening bird-related disease, I guess, since the invention of the Chicken McNuggets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC has a new reality show about how our government protects our borders, waterways, and airports. Have you seen this? It's called 'Homeland Security USA,' or, as they call it in Afghanistan, 'the Terrorist Learning Channel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's the name of the show: 'Homeland Security USA.' I think that's better than the original title,&quot; which &quot;was 'Hey, Not So Fast, Ahmed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush is writing a book about her years in the White House. And when she asked President Bush if he would write the foreword, he said, 'Honey, I love you so much I'll write five, six, or seven words.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Barack Obama Plans To Fix The Economy: &quot;10. Encourage tourists to throw spare change in the Grand Canyon. 9. End our dependence on foreign owls. 8. Sell New Mexico to Mexico. 7. Put a little of that bailout money on the Ravens plus 3 at Tennessee. Come on! It's a mortal lock! 6. Rent out the moon for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs. 5. Lotto our way out of this son-of-a-bitch. 4. Appear on 'Deal or No Deal' and hope to choose the right briefcase. 3. Bail out the adult film industry -- not sure how it helps, but it can't hurt. 2. Release O.J. from prison; have him steal America's money from China. 1. Stop talkin' and start Obama-natin'!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couple of days ago&quot; in &quot;New Jersey,&quot; there were &quot;UFO sightings. ... Believe me, it's not an invasion.&quot; The aliens are &quot;actually here&quot; because they &quot;want some of that Federal bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you have your tickets for the inauguration down in Washington? I sent in early. I sent the money in. I got my tickets back, lousy seats.&quot; You &quot;know where they put me? ... I'm right between Govs. Spitzer and Blagojevich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know for each inauguration, the President adds his own little touches, his own signature note to the proceedings. For example, maybe you don't remember this but for the...first&quot; Clinton inauguration, &quot;ladies drank free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President-elect Joe Biden...is already getting acquainted with his new responsibility as Vice President. And he's starting every afternoon at 3:00. He picks up Sasha and Malia from school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Barack Obama wants the surgeon general to be Sanjay Gupta, the TV doctor. Are you familiar with Sanjay? I went to see him a couple of years ago because I had an inflamed gupta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sanjay Gupta says if&quot; he becomes &quot;the surgeon general the first thing he wants to do is warn people about one thing -- the Regis Philbin show in high def. He said it could cause nausea&quot; and &quot;headaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech about the economy, Barack Obama said that Americans will soon be able to go online and see where the bailout money is being spent. ... In response, Americans said, 'Thanks, but we'll stick to downloading porn.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, during his speech, it's interesting, Barack Obama said, 'It will soon be too late to change course if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible.' It's a quote, yeah. And Obama said the same thing about NBC's prime-time lineup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Inauguration Day, Barack Obama will be riding in a brand new presidential limousine&quot; made by General Motors. &quot;Yeah, the parade route is five miles long, so GM says Obama should only have to stop for gas twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marvel Comics just announced that President-elect Obama is going to be featured in an upcoming edition of 'Spider-Man.' ... When he heard about it, President Bush said, 'Okay, now I'm jealous. He gets to meet Spidey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of cool. In Washington, the National Gallery announced that it will display a campaign poster of Barack Obama. Yeah. In a related story, a campaign poster of Joe Biden will be displayed at the Hair Club for Men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an exciting first day for our first lady, who got a new set of plates. First Lady Laura Bush showed off the new gold-rimmed official state china. It cost $493,000, but don't worry. It was paid for by a private trust, funded by lunatics who donate half a million dollars to buy the White House plates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mrs. Bush said she'd been hoping to use the china herself, but she ordered it two years ago and it just came, which is what happens when you order your table service from FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bushes, by the way, aren't the only presidents to have their own china. Truman, Reagan, and Clinton all had it too, though the Clinton service is missing some plates and I think a soup bowl because of Hillary throwing them at Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'll tell you something, nothing to me says recession like spending a half a million dollars on dinnerware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Joe the plumber? ... A conservative website is sending Joe the plumber to Gaza as their war correspondent.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week the chief of staff for embattled Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich spoke to Illinois state workers on issues of ethics in the workplace. How ironic was that? Was Bernard Madoff not available?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard&quot; that &quot;lawmakers in Illinois voted 114-1 to impeach the governor. ... So apparently, Blagojevich was only able to bribe one person.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blagojevich held a press conference&quot; in which he &quot;quoted the British poet Tennyson. He quoted Tennyson, which was weird, because he usually quotes the movie, 'Jerry Maguire.' 'Show me the money!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, I don't think he gets it. When he found out he was impeached, Blagojevich said he has a replacement governor already picked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see Barack Obama's speech about the economy yesterday? Very sobering. He told Washington, 'We've arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility.' And of course, there's only one way out of it. Spend more money we don't have. Yeah, that's the ticket!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's mother-in-law is moving into the White House.&quot; Well, &quot;if that doesn't get him to solve the economic crisis, nothing will. 'We'll get you your own place, Ma. Don't worry!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, at the White House -- historic. Barack Obama met with all three living ex-presidents and one current brain-dead president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the picture of all the ex-presidents? Very impressive standing there. And they all had lunch together. And Barack Obama, you know this guy is nothing if not eloquent. Barack said that the men he met with, these presidents, all understood both the pressures and the possibilities of the office of the presidency, but of all of them, Bill Clinton was the only one who really understood the possibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something good for the environment. President Bush recently declared three Pacific Ocean regions as national monuments. Again, you see, I don't think President Bush understands the impact of some of these things. When officials said this would create the largest marine reserve in the world, he said, 'Great, let's get some of them to Iraq and Afghanistan. Let's see if we can send them over there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the adult entertainment industry, also known as the porn industry, is now looking for a $5 billion bailout from Congress. It's unbelievable. Of course, a lot of Americans are against bailing out an industry they believe is obscene. But hey, we bailed out the Lehman Brothers. Can't get more obscene then that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, when he was in the White House the other day, Jimmy Carter thought he was still president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number one state for teen pregnancy -- anybody know? Mississippi. ... And they did it the hard way, without the Palin family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Richard Nixon's birthday. ... Do you remember when he looked like a bad president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush now&quot; has a &quot;couple of weeks&quot; until &quot;he's out of office. And people are...saying, 'Mr. President, what are you going to do?'&quot; He &quot;said, 'I'm hoping to find something where I just get in up to my head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama and his family have actually now moved into Washington, DC. This week, their stuff arrived via U-Haul One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney is leaving Washington,&quot; and &quot;Cheney was busy packing earlier today. He bubble wrapped his water board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey. Here's great news. Remember Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, governor of Alaska. Well, she has a new grandson,&quot; and the &quot;baby boy's name is Tripp. Apparently, Oops was taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin &quot;was very excited.&quot; She brought &quot;the grandson over to her house and held it up to the window so the Russians could get a look at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was quite an event. The baby was delivered by Joe the obstetrician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some bad news. A lot of Broadway things are closing. Hair Spray is closing, Grief, Young Frankenstein.&quot; But &quot;President Bush is excited. He says, 'Great, we're winning the war on musicals.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, was impeached today by the state legislature...while he was out for a jog. This is why I don't jog. You never know what could happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news for Sarah Palin.&quot; A &quot;poll by a real estate website found that she is America's number one choice for celebrity neighbor. Oprah came in second, which seems kind of crazy to me, because if you live next door to Oprah,&quot; she &quot;won't shoot your pets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Golden Globes were held in Beverly Hills last night.&quot; Kate Winslet &quot;won one for the film 'The Reader.' ... President Bush said today he didn't know what 'The Reader' was about, but he said the title sounded really scary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview that was taped yesterday, President Bush said that the biggest disappointment of his Presidency was the people who expressed bitterness about his leadership. And that was just at the Christmas dinner with his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all across the country -- this is kind of sad -- unemployment offices are swamped with people waiting to file for unemployment insurance. It's gotten so bad that the offices are overwhelmed and can't function. I got an idea. Why don't you hire more people? They're right there in line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how bad it is. You know the Small Business Administration? It's now the Teensy-Weensy Business Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, health experts are now concerned that this bad economy may be causing Americans to gain weight. They call it 'recession pounds.' ... So guys, if your wife or girlfriend says, 'Do these pants make me look like we're in a recession?' be careful what you say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the adult entertainment industry, better known as the porn industry, say they are looking for a government bailout. So it looks like Barack Obama may have found a Cabinet position for Bill Clinton as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Mayor of Baltimore, a woman named Sheila Dixon, has now been charged with 12 counts of felony theft, perjury, fraud, and misconduct in office. The good news ? she's now eligible to become mayor of Detroit or governor of Illinois.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Illinois House voted to impeach&quot; Blagojevich. They &quot;voted 114-1,&quot; but Blagojevich is so &quot;cocky,&quot; he is &quot;now asking for a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama will be the first president-elect to be featured on the cover of the 'Spider-Man' comic book.&quot; But he is &quot;not the first president&quot; to be featured in such a manner. Bush &quot;has been on 'Archie' comics for years&quot; as &quot;Jughead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it cold outside? Yeah! Here's how cold it is.&quot; It is so &quot;cold in the Midwest, out there in Chicago, Governor Blagojevich had to put the ear flaps down on his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's cold here in New York City. The temperature is actually lower than President Bush's approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; had &quot;his final press conference today,&quot; and &quot;it went pretty well. Only three shoes were thrown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After eight years,&quot; it is &quot;kind of sad President Bush had his final press conference. And you know what that means for us here at the 'Late Show.' We're going to have to start writing our own comedy again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama...promised&quot; his &quot;kids he would get them&quot; a &quot;dog when they moved to the White House.&quot; But &quot;President Bush is nervous. When he heard dog in the White House, he thought, 'Uh oh! What if he digs up all those Al Gore ballots in the back?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three days before his inauguration, Barack Obama is going to retrace Abraham Lincoln's route by taking an Amtrak train from Philadelphia to Washington DC.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota's developing a miniature, environmentally friendly car that is powered entirely by a rechargeable battery. Yeah. Meanwhile, Detroit still hard at work on an SUV that runs on rain forest trees and panda blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A senator from Ohio is retiring,&quot; and &quot;there is a rumor that Dennis Kucinich may run for the Senate to replace him. Yeah. If so, Kucinich would be the first guy in history to run for a Senate booster seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has asked all the major networks for 15 minutes of air time on Thursday to give his farewell speech to the nation. Well, the White House says he's going to use part of the time to list his accomplishments. No word yet what he's going to do with the other 14 minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, listen to this. NBC said if the speech does really well in ratings, they're going to offer President Bush his own show every night at nine o'clock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama is starting to get an idea of just how hard&quot; his new &quot;job is going to be. Today, he said he wanted to bring a 'sense' of accountability to Washington. I think they realized actual accountability, never going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know Barack Obama's mother-in-law is going to be moving into the White House with them? I think this qualifies as change&quot; Barack Obama &quot;does not believe in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, let me ask you, when Barack Obama's mother-in-law moves into the White House,&quot; do &quot;you think she's going to be like all mother-in-laws? Like, when Barack Obama is upstairs asleep at the White House, do you think she'll be down in the kitchen with Michelle, going, 'You know, you could have done better.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during Hillary's confirmation hearing today, Louisiana Senator David Vitter -- remember the guy that got caught with the hookers?&quot; Well, &quot;he's Mr. Ethics now.&quot; He was &quot;very concerned about who's contributing to Bill Clinton's campaign, you know the library deal.&quot; But &quot;he had to leave when an aide told him&quot; it was time for his &quot;'three o'clock with Bambi and Thumper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of Americans who are obese...now outnumber the number of Americans who are merely overweight. One-third of all Americans are obese. You know what that means? One out of every three people is three people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The New York Times' reporting on a radical new treatment for intensive care patients: Get them up and out of bed as soon as possible. ... Is that new? Haven't HMOs been doing that for years?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's cold here in New York City today, isn't it? Freezing cold. Here's how cold it was earlier today. President Bush said, 'We misunderestimated Al Roker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, says that&quot; President-elect Barack Obama's &quot;stimulus plan will help the economy. How would he know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this, ladies and gentlemen. One week from today, Barack Obama becomes president and the current president becomes George W. Bush, mall cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think everybody has warm feelings for George Bush now. He held his final press conference yesterday. He admitted -- it takes a big man to do this -- he admitted that a couple things didn't go according to plan. A couple of things went haywire. His first term and his second term. Those two things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush did take credit for a couple of things. He said, 'You know, Dick Cheney hasn't shot anybody in a couple of years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, one week from tomorrow, here's what's going to happen. George W. Bush will be walking around...on the ranch in Crawford, Texas, and he'll be saying, 'Listen to this, boys. You ought to see it. The office, it's an oval. Like a circle but it's an oval. I'm not kidding. No corners. It's like an oval. Honest to God. I was there for eight years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is giving his farewell address tomorrow night. It's going to air on the three major TV networks. And NBC. It will be on NBC as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama starts&quot; as president &quot;next week.&quot; But &quot;Iranian protesters took to the streets yesterday and burned posters of&quot; him, and &quot;I'm thinking, oh, come on! He's not even in office yet. I don't think these guys are angry. I think they just like fire. It is winter in Iran. They're cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The website Craigslist is flooded with ads from men looking for dates to the Barack Obama inauguration. I'm thinking, whatever happened to the good old Washington DC tradition of getting a hooker?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People, I think, are...excited because Barack Obama's inauguration is one week away. ... Some people are worried, though, because 3 million people are expected for the inauguration, but there will only be 5,000 port-a-potties. That's true. Officials say they would have paid a lot more attention to bladder issues if John McCain had been elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearing for secretary of state began today. And...it's interesting because when you think about it, by the end of the week, Hillary will be a confirmed secretary of state, and Bill Clinton will be a confirmed bachelor. She's going to leave town, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was President Bush's last cabinet meeting. ... At one point, Bush got emotional and said, 'I never got to find out what HUD means.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, one more week left of President Bush,&quot; and &quot;the President has been busy saying his good-byes. Yesterday, he gave an unusually candid and animated press conference. As you may know, President Bush was never a big fan of press conferences because the press never...really understood him, mostly because he makes up his own words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really going to miss him. Can't we find a position for him? Something where we still get to hear the stupid stuff, but he doesn't actually make any decisions? I mean, I'm all for change, but I have a show to do here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, tomorrow night, President Bush will give his farewell address to the nation. Or, as the White House is calling it, a very special episode of 'Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama says one of the first things he'll do as president is sign an executive order closing down Guantanamo Bay,&quot; to &quot;which President Bush said, 'Hey, well that's nothing. I've closed down factories, car dealerships...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, a spokesman for Barack Obama says the prisoners that are released from Guantanamo will either be sent back to their home countries or enter the New York City cab driver training program.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama also says he wants to bring a sense of accountability to Washington. ... I've got a better idea. Why don't you bring some accountants to Washington, okay? Tell us where the hell our $750 billion went!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, the new Treasury secretary nominee, Timothy Geithner, has come up with a plan to lower taxes. Don't pay them!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a last-minute complication to what looked like an otherwise smooth path to confirmation, Timothy Geithner, President-elect Obama's nominee for the secretary of Treasury admitted that from 2001 to 2004 he failed to pay $34,000 in Federal tax. ... Fortunately for him, this is not his field of expertise. You know, he's just nominee for Secretary of the Treasury!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Democratic spokesman called the issue today 'an honest mistake.' How come, in Washington, the only time anyone is honest is when they make a mistake?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you ever notice this? Whenever politicians don't pay their taxes, 'Oh, it's an honest mistake.' Huh? You know what they call it when you and I don't pay our taxes? 'Exhibit A for the prosecution.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, appearing on Fox News Sunday morning, confirmed that he is planning on writing a book. Bush admitted he'll use a ghost writer. Well, sure, if it's about his Presidency, it's going to be a horror story. He'll need a ghost writer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday morning, on the 'Today Show,' they did a big story about Barack Obama's mother-in-law moving into the White House. ... Basically, they believe...she'll be a big help to the family. Not as big a help as it would have been to have Bill Clinton's mother-in-law living in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And health experts are now concerned that the bad economy may be causing Americans to gain weight. They call it 'recession pounds.' Really? Recession pounds? Have these people been to a shopping mall in the last ten years? Either that theory is dead wrong or we've been in a recession since 1985, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the adult film industry, better known as the porn industry, has asked Congress for a $5 billion bailout. They say they're going to use the money to make more fuel efficient porn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five billion. You know, between the porn industry and Congress, I don't know who's screwed more people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neiman Marcus announced they are cutting 400 jobs.&quot; See, &quot;I knew this would happen when the Republicans took away Sarah Palin's campaign credit card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Tony Blair was given the Medal of Freedom by President Bush,&quot; but there was an &quot;awkward moment.&quot; When &quot;President Bush found out that Cherie Blair was a barrister, he said, 'Oh, you make coffee at Starbucks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold, isn't it, ladies and gentlemen? ... It was so cold today people were throwing shoes at Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden&quot; will not &quot;go away.&quot; There is &quot;a brand new...bin Laden tape,&quot; and &quot;they've authenticated it. They know it's a recent tape because&quot; bin Laden &quot;describes Salma Hayak as 'smokin' hot' on the Golden Globes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One week,&quot; and &quot;Barack Obama will be the new President of the United States. I'm telling you, things are really starting to look bad for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the ninth anniversary of my quintuple bypass heart surgery,&quot; or &quot;as Dick Cheney calls it, 'a routine checkup.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is busy saying good-bye to everybody. Last night he was on Larry King, and I think tomorrow he's making a farewell lasagna with Rachel Ray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is getting nostalgic. He says he's not sure how he will feel on January 21st,&quot; but &quot;I think I kind of know how the rest of us will feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Larry King interviewed President Bush, and Bush told him, 'My favorite color is blue and I love enchiladas.' ... Unfortunately, Bush was answering the question, 'What was your greatest achievement as President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has been giving Barack Obama a lot of advice. They've had a few meetings and he's giving Obama advice. Yeah. President Bush has told Barack Obama that his biggest challenge will be an enemy attack. ... Specifically, Bush told Obama to keep your eye on Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has declared an advanced state of emergency in DC from Saturday until Wednesday to allow for extra security&quot; for the inauguration. Apparently, &quot;the President obtained information from a very reliable source that on Tuesday an unidentified black man is plotting to break into and actually live in the White House for at least four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, it seems fitting to me that President Bush would leave Washington, DC, in a state of emergency on the day he leaves office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President was on 'Larry King' last night for one last...hard-hitting interview before he packs up and tries to find his way back home to Texas.&quot; King &quot;asked the President...if he personally lost money in the stock market.&quot; Bush &quot;said he has no idea because all his money is in a blind trust managed by a Nigerian prince who's about to collect a huge inheritance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that the President doesn't know where his money is. If he doesn't know where ours is, he shouldn't know where his is either, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it's cold all over the East Coast.&quot; And did &quot;you see those blizzards all over the place? The whole country was so white the Republicans thought they were back in charge again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Incoming press secretary Robert Gibbs...said&quot; President-elect Barack Obama &quot;will allow gays to serve openly in the military. So the days of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' are over. Actually, that's not quite true. Congress will continue to use the phrase when referring to the bailout money. 'Don't Ask Us What We Did With It, We're Not Going To Tell You Where It Went.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Nominee Eric Holder said as far as he is concerned, waterboarding is torture. And Treasury secretary&quot; nominee &quot;Tim Geithner said, 'So is paying taxes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard,&quot; Tim Geithner, &quot;who's been chosen to be our next secretary of the Treasury...didn't pay&quot; $34,000 in &quot;federal taxes from 2001 to 2004. ... But to keep the nomination afloat, he paid it this week,&quot; plus &quot;another $8,000 in interest. So that's $42,000 the US Treasury made just like that. You know what Barack Obama should do now? He should appoint Willie Nelson&quot; to the position of &quot;Commerce secretary. What does he owe, $28 million?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how cold it is&quot; outside. Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich &quot;was selling seats in his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President-elect Barack Obama plans to close...Guantanamo, you know, the big holding center, the big prison, the interrogation center in Cuba. He is going to close that down. And Dick Cheney -- I thought this was interesting -- Dick Cheney said, 'Oh, fine, sure, I'm going to buy it and turn it into a vacation home.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush will leave January 20th. Yes. Will it never get here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney,&quot; meanwhile, &quot;said, 'I'll leave when I damn well feel like it.' But that's another story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to tell you, it's so cold. ... It's so cold that Sarah Palin shot herself a brand-new coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army says that it has managed to increase recruitment by allowing fatter people to enlist. Yeah. As a result, the Army has changed its slogan from 'Army of one' to 'Army of one who looks like three or four.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I have the perfect solution to this cold. I was thinking about it today. Let's swap countries with Mexico. Everyone who lives there moves here and vice versa. You want it so bad, you can have it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has four days left in office,&quot; and he &quot;made his farewell address to the nation this evening.&quot; He &quot;was very gracious regarding Barack Obama. He said Obama offers hope to the nation. And I thought this was nice. He actually went shopping with Laura and personally picked out the bag he's going to leave Obama holding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush&quot; will soon be gone from the White House, but &quot;he's not going to fade away. He's only 62 years old and he says there are still plenty of challenges to fail to meet, there are still goals to fall short of, and people to disappoint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...the Governor of California,&quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;gave his annual State of the State address this morning. And while you might think that after five years in office, he has run out of cute references to his own movies.&quot; But he &quot;most certainly&quot; has not, because he made reference to &quot;Conan's sword&quot; in today's speech. All &quot;that's left is for him to tell the Board of Education about 'Kindergarten Cop,' right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, America will get to hear those four words we've been waiting for, 'former President George Bush,' President Bush said he is leaving Washington with his head held high, because it is the best way to spot shoes that are coming at you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is also Dick Cheney's last full day in office. Actually, he spent the entire day trying to get the price of gas back up to $4 a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you watch the news, you know a lot of celebrities in Washington for the inauguration. Isn't that unbelievable? So many celebrities are out of town, over in Malibu, they had to close the Promises Rehab Center for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good luck trying to find a place to stay. Given how hard it is to get a room in Washington, even Bill and Hillary had to double up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that was quite a pre-inaugural show they put on in Washington yesterday. Then Barack Obama got up and he told the crowd that 'anything is possible in America' except, of course, the Eagles being in the Super Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released a new tape where he displays a shortness of breath, and experts say it raises questions about his health. See, that's how you know this war has been going on too long, okay. When our enemies start dying of natural causes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In less than 12 hours, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the next President. Yeah. Actually, if I were you -- if I were you, I wouldn't cheer. You'd be surprised how much President Bush can screw up in 12 hours. He just launched an attack on the Bahamas, okay?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going nuts in Washington, though. The festivities have already begun. Yesterday, in Washington, Barack Obama was on hand -- did you see this? For performances by Jon Bon Jovi, Garth Brooks and John Mellencamp. Yeah. So, folks, it really is a new era for African-Americans. All the music they love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, some people are really angry because the festivities for Barack Obama's inauguration, guess what? Are gonna cost $170 million. Yeah, after hearing about it, Oprah said, 'Don't worry. This one's on me.' She put down her Amex card made of plutonium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, this is nice, Barack Obama hosted a dinner honoring John McCain. You can tell the dinner was to honor John McCain, because it was over by 4:00 P.M.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Washington's Union Station, Ikea has built a replica of the Oval Office where all the furnishing have been replaced with Ikea furniture. Yeah, experts say it finally answers the question, 'What if the President was a 28-year-old divorced guy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, this is kind of weird, an illustrator from 'The Washington Post' made a sketch of what Barack Obama might look like after the stress of an eight-year presidency. Unfortunately for Obama, he's gonna look a lot like Grady from 'Sanford and Son.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is winding things down. Yep, today was President Bush's last full day in office. He called the leaders of Denmark, Italy, Russia and South Korea to say, 'thank you.' Yeah, his exact words were, 'thank you for being one of the last four countries that will still take my calls.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama now the 44th President of the United States. Fascinating. As you know, we've never had an African-American president.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Cheney pulled a muscle in his back. Did you see him in the wheelchair today?&quot; You would &quot;think...being in a wheelchair would make Cheney more sympathetic,&quot; but &quot;it made him look...kind of evil, didn't it?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you all see Obama's speech? He said America is finally ready to lead again,&quot; to &quot;which Bush said, 'Hey, I'm sitting here! Hello! I'm still here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought Obama gave a great speech.&quot; But &quot;I think he may have promised too much, like when he promised to bring the dog from the 'Marley &amp; Me' movie back to life.&quot; That &quot;seemed over the top to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supreme Court...Chief Justice John Roberts made a mistake during the swearing in of Barack Obama. ... That's the second mistake the Supreme Court has made with a president, if you count the time they declared Bush the winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single TV network was covering the inauguration, except Fox. They're still doing the recount.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you could not afford to go to the inauguration, there's a perfect way to recreate the experience at home. Here's what you do. You play back the tape of Barack and then you put the air conditioner on full blast, then stand in line for six hours waiting to use your own bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Barack Obama missed the perfect opportunity to balance the budget today. Did you see those thousands of port-a-potties? Make them pay toilets, we'd have a surplus by tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was cold. ... It was so cold in Washington, it felt like Hillary's inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, Al Gore led a prayer for global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, by the end of the inauguration, everybody's face looked like Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during the inauguration, Washington, DC, set up prostitution-free zones. ... Areas where there is no prostitution? Isn't that supposed to be the whole city, huh? I mean, is Washington so corrupt now we just rope off the areas where people actually follow the law?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Jill Biden, Vice President Joe Biden's wife, slipped on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,'&quot; when &quot;she said, 'Well, you know, Barack Obama actually offered Joe the vice presidency or Secretary of State.'&quot; She &quot;said she was glad that Joe Biden chose the vice presidency because he would be home with her more often. See, the Secretary of State is out of the country way too much,&quot; so Joe Biden went with the vice presidency. His decision led Bill Clinton to say &quot;to Joe, 'I owe you, man!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is in the &quot;latest issue of&quot; the &quot;'Spider-Man' comics. ... That's when you know you're big, when you're&quot; in &quot;'Spider-Man' comics. ... The story is about how Spider-Man stops bad guys from ruining Barack's inauguration. And psychologists believe this comic book was actually very handy in helping President Bush understand the transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What an historic day, ladies and gentlemen.&quot; The &quot;whole country&quot; was &quot;riveted by Barack Obama's inauguration. Two million people were in Washington to watch it, and then everyone else in the country&quot; watched it on TV. Yeah, &quot;I don't think America's been this excited since they figured out how to put cheese inside pizza crust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a true story. Some people alongside Barack Obama's inaugural parade route got bored waiting for it to start. So, did you see this? They started doing the electric slide. Yeah, apparently, the best way to celebrate our first black president is to do the whitest dance imaginable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the living ex-presidents attended the swearing-in ceremony. But did you see this? Bill Clinton got the biggest response from the crowd. Did you see that? Yeah. Yeah, apparently, thousands of women yelled, 'That's him, officer!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very cold today in Washington. Yeah. In fact, with the wind chill, President Bush's approval rating reached minus 13.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was using superlatives today to talk about this historic day, all the broadcasters. During NBC's coverage, Brian Williams said that the inauguration is like the Super Bowl. Yeah. The only difference is that the New York Jets had a chance to go to the inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials at the White House say that President Bush completed his last piece of official business in the Oval Office at 6:00 am this morning. Yep. Bush says it should take Obama weeks to find where he hid the dead fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, people who went to elementary school&quot; with &quot;Barack Obama say that they remember him as a chubby boy named Barry. Yeah. And folks, even as we speak, those people's tax returns are being audited.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a jam-packed Inauguration Day. You all know that,&quot; but what &quot;you don't know is that outgoing President George W. Bush had many events scheduled, as well, today. Really busy schedule. Let's take a look at Bush's to-do list for his last day in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Take down my 14 autographed posters of Jeff Foxworthy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Pardon the Hamburglar.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Finally visit Oval Office, see what all the fuss is about.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Play actual game of 'Connect Four' instead of my favorite, 'Connect Two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Send 1,000 pizzas to Obama's new house (get address first).'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Write name on South Lawn with my 'Prez Juice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Give the finger to every portrait that's been eyein' me funny for the past eight years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Buy a lot of fruit roll-ups, then wrap myself up in them to be a big scary fruit mummy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Make one last joke to Condoleezza about 'brown rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. 'See how many Styrofoam packing peanuts I can fit in my left nostril.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. 'Write a thank-you note to Chef Boyardee.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. 'Find out what happens when I press that red button.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is the new President of the United States, our 44th.&quot; As &quot;our first African-American president, Obama fulfills the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, and as our first Hawaiian president,&quot; he &quot;fulfills the dream of Don Ho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They estimate that around two million people crowded in to the National Mall to see Obama's swearing-in ceremony, which is the first time a mall has been crowded in about a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I tell you something, it's silly to say that President Bush was the worst president of all time. We don't know that. All we can say is that he was the worst president so far, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Cheney was in a wheelchair at the inauguration. His aides say he pulled a muscle while moving boxes yesterday. But I don't know if I believe that. In fact, if you look closely, you can see the reason he's in a wheelchair is because his feet turned back into hooves a day before they were supposed to. That was not as it was agreed upon in the pact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice to have you all here. As you all know, George Bush is no longer president, so they'll be no monologue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And during his inaugural address yesterday,&quot; President Barack Obama &quot;said, 'Millions of Americans have lost their homes and some of us who still have homes have their mother-in-laws moving in with them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said his first act as president will be to pardon Aretha Franklin's hat.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two million people attended the inauguration, compared to less than 500,000 when Bush was inaugurated four years ago. But that makes sense because four years ago, you know, people had jobs to go to.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was a stumbling during the reading of the oath,&quot; when the &quot;chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, forgot the words for a second and then he got them in the wrong order. See, how typical is that? Barack, just a second before he takes over, the Republicans get one last screw up in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, apparently the chief justice stumbled on the word faithfully. But to be fair, a lot of people in Washington have trouble with any version of the word faithfully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech yesterday, Barack Obama promised to harness the sun, the wind, and the soil, to which the Amish said, 'Yeah, it's a big change. Yeah, we'll get on that right away. Yeah, Ezekiel and I haven't been doing that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The total cost of the inauguration&quot; was &quot; $170 million. They say this is the most of the expensive celebration since that last AIG retreat on our bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see former Vice President Cheney in the wheelchair? He's fine, nothing to worry about. See,&quot; Cheney is &quot;very calculating. Apparently, he drove his own car, and he grabbed the wheelchair so he could take a handicap space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday had the largest gathering of celebrities for any inauguration ever. In fact, there were so many celebrities and politicians together, it broke the old record set by the Betty Ford Clinic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michele Obama's inaugural ball gown, which she wore during the first dance -- beautiful gown -- was created by&quot; a designer with the last name of Wu, which is &quot;a great name for a designer, isn't it?&quot; Because &quot;when you walk in, people go 'woo!' You know,&quot; Wu is &quot;so much more fortunate than that other designer, Elliott Eh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC News reporting that backstage, President Jimmy Carter appeared to snub President Clinton on his way out to the platform. Anybody notice that? Apparently, Carter's upset Clinton rejected his friend request on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...at the congressional luncheon held after he took office, President Obama asked lawmakers to reflect on what we know is in the hearts of the American people. Turns out, it's grease, fat,&quot; and &quot;lots of cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh actually, you know who gave the shortest inauguration speech in history? George Washington,&quot; whose speech was &quot;just a couple minutes long,&quot; which &quot;makes sense because, remember, George Washington couldn't tell a lie, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner...apologized to Congress today for not paying his taxes.&quot; And &quot;Wesley Snipes said, 'Why didn't I think of that? Hey, I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Geithner testified to the Senate Finance Committee today that his failure to pay taxes was just a 'careless mistake.' See, remember it was an honest mistake last week, now it's a 'careless mistake.' He says he does his own taxes and he just made a mistake. Well, that's great. So the guy who's going to be in charge of the IRS is not a criminal, phew, just incompetent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the show 'Dancing With the Stars' trying to get Cindy McCain on the program. How about that? Not to be outdone, John McCain been offered a part in the show 'Bones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama got his new limousine. It has all the latest technology,&quot; although they &quot;did take out President Bush's favorite piece of technology, the PlayStation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new season of 'Lost' kicked off tonight. ... If you haven't seen it, 'Lost' is about a group of desperate people out of touch with the world. It's based on the true story of the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, millions of people leaving Washington&quot; following Tuesday's inauguration.&quot; Actually, &quot;so many people are trying to leave&quot; that &quot;all the Amtrak trains are sold out.&quot; So, apparently, &quot;Barack Obama can work miracles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, Barack Obama entered the Oval Office for the first time as president and he spent ten minutes alone. Yep. Shows you how things have changed. When President Bush spent ten minutes alone in the Oval Office, it was called a time-out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in San Francisco, someone replaced all the street signs on Bush Street with signs that say Obama Street. ... Locals say it doesn't really matter because every street in San Francisco goes both ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, in one of his first official acts as president, Barack Obama had an emergency meeting with his top economic advisors to find out just, you know, what the situation is. And, apparently, it didn't go well, because after the meeting, Obama sold North and South Dakota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, when President Bush returned to Texas, people who were there to greet him were holding up signs that said, 'You made us so proud.' ... Afterwards, the people admitted that the store was out of 'You totally embarrassed us' signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at Barack Obama's inauguration,&quot; he &quot;was sworn in on an old Bible that was used by Abraham Lincoln. Yeah. Yeah, and the weird part is, Lincoln checked the Bible out of a library. There are $73,000 in late fees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Joe Biden's first full day as vice president. Yeah, advisors say Biden spent most of the day watering his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, this is weird, vendors along the parade route were selling binoculars that they called 'Barackulars.' That's true. And even worse, the ShamWow guy was selling 'ShamWowbamas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big announcement. Warner Brothers announced that it is outsourcing several hundred jobs to India,&quot; which &quot;explains why in the next 'Batman' movie, the Batmobile is a bus with 400 people hanging off the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is back in Texas, unemployed like much of the rest of America.&quot; Bush &quot;reportedly spent the day cataloging his papers, outlining his memoirs, and sketching out plans for his presidential library. Just kidding. He spent four hours seeing how many Reese's Pieces he could hold between his toes ? 38, it turns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, after going to ten inaugural balls last night and...dancing&quot; more &quot;than Cloris Leachman in nine weeks of 'Dancing With the Stars,' the new president was up and in the office at 8:35 in the morning and then he was at church at 9:30. Is it a good sign that after one hour of being president, he decided the best thing he could do for the country is pray?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, while their parents were at the inaugural balls, Sasha and Malia Obama, the kids, had their own little party at the White House. They held a scavenger hunt for them and some other kids. ... And this is the best thing. At the end of the scavenger hunt, they opened door and in a closet waiting for them were the Jonas Brothers. True. I guess they did the same thing with the Bush twins back in 2000, only it was Motley Crue with a tray of Jell-O shots in the closet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today they're coming out with an official Inauguration Day DVD. And listen to this, it's going to contain a lot of extras, including the Supreme Court Justice John Roberts blooper reel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you haul hear about this? Because of the flubbed oath of office the other day, Chief Justice John Roberts went over to the White House last night and gave Barack Obama the oath again.&quot; Some &quot;legal scholars were concerned that the oath was not given properly, we legally did not have anybody at the helm for 36 hours. Thirty-six hours? We haven't had anybody at the helm for eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course,&quot; this &quot;time when&quot; Chief Justice Roberts &quot;gave the oath, it was a lot more informal. Like instead of wearing his robe,&quot; Roberts &quot;just had on a Snuggie.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And even though there was a lot of coverage of the inauguration here, in Iran, state TV completely ignored it -- no film, no radio. It was like the inauguration wasn't even happening. I'm sorry, that was Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Barack Obama signed an executive order calling for the closure of Guantanamo Bay within a year. You know how he can close it faster? Make it a bank, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama issued an executive order banning gifts from lobbyists -- any gifts to anyone serving in his administration. In fact, today, they went down and removed the gas pump that Exxon installed in Dick Cheney's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the media frenzy over Barack Obama just getting bigger and bigger. It is really contagious. In fact, now that Barack Obama's president, Michael Jackson said he's thinking about being black again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this, the same day that the first African-American became president, peanut butter was recalled because it had salmonella in it. So for George Washington Carver, a day of mixed emotions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while Barack Obama was in the inaugural parade the other day, he was wearing what the Secret Service called a bullet-resistant suit. ... Suit was made out of what they call 'bullet resistant material.' You know, here's my question. The man's the President. Spend a couple of bucks, go the extra yard, get the bullet proof suit, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on President Bush's flight back to Texas on Tuesday, they showed a video of his accomplishments. So apparently he didn't fly over New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Senate has confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. That means Hillary will be fourth in line for the presidency. After vice president, speaker of the House, and president pro-tem of the Senate, she is next, which means they're going to need extra security to protect the vice president, speaker of the House, and&quot; the president pro-tem of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...Caroline Kennedy,&quot; who &quot;was hoping to fill in Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat, has now taken her name out of contention.&quot; The &quot;'New York Times' reports&quot; the &quot;reason Carolyn Kennedy dropped out&quot; has to do with a &quot;housekeeper and tax issues. ... The good news&quot; is &quot;she's still eligible to be treasury secretary.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Hillary Clinton's first day as secretary of state. She's now in charge of all foreign affairs. Bill Clinton will still handle domestic affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain was on 'Larry King Live' earlier tonight,&quot; and &quot;they talked about the biggest threat facing them today, which is teenagers on their lawn.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama&quot; has &quot;signed an executive order to close down Guantanamo Bay. Thank goodness. Good for you, sir,&quot; because &quot;I did not like Gitmo from the get-go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today -- you probably heard this -- President Obama signed the order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. ... And, in the spirit of ending torture, Obama also ended the New Kids on the Block tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all appeared together at a press conference.&quot; But there &quot;was an awkward moment when both men realized they were wearing the same suit as Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's chief of staff has ordered Federal agencies to freeze funding on a lot of projects that President Bush tried to push through in his final days.&quot; So &quot;for now, the National Scooby-Doo Museum remains a distant dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shortly after his inauguration,&quot; President Barack Obama &quot;spoke on the phone to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. Yeah, both men started their call by asking Obama, 'Hey, what's the deal with Aretha Franklin's hat?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama&quot; introduced &quot;his foreign policy team today, including new Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ... Meanwhile, Bill Clinton is already in Ibiza judging a Hawaiian Tropics judging bikini contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also yesterday,&quot; President Obama &quot;had to have the oath of office readministered&quot; by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. You &quot;may remember, the first time they did it, it didn't take because they were both really drunk and screwed it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were two million people crammed into&quot; the National Mall &quot;this week,&quot; and not &quot;one arrest. Not one crime was committed in Washington. Of course, that'll all change now that Congress is back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The official temperature at the inauguration was 18 degrees. John McCain said it was so cold his teeth were chattering, and they were in his pocket at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today it was revealed that the chamber music they played&quot; at the inauguration &quot;was pre-recorded.&quot; They &quot;said it was too important to mess up,&quot; unlike &quot;the swearing-in ceremony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all heard about that, how&quot; Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts &quot;screwed up the oath of office. Then the other night, Roberts went to the White House, and they did it over again, which is completely unprecedented. That's never happened. Not messing up the oath, having someone in government actually go back and fix something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama has signed an executive order officially banning torture in the United States. You know what that means? ABC may be forced to cancel 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is...kind of embarrassing. A terrorist who was released from Guantanamo Bay last year is now reportedly back in Yemen as a top Al Qaeda deputy. Apparently, Guantanamo Bay has the same success rate as the Promises Rehab Center in Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually, he was released to Saudi Arabia in 2007 and passed through&quot; a &quot;Saudi rehabilitation program for former jihadists. ... What's that like? 'My name is Ahmed, I'm a jihadist.' 'Hello, Ahmed! Here's your chip. Thank you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and after lots of discussion and intervention by the Secret Service, Barack Obama will be allowed to keep his BlackBerry, but his use of it will be limited. So I guess he's going to be on Verizon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's a special Blackberry built just&quot; for President Obama. They are &quot;calling it 'BarackBerry.'&quot; It does not &quot;even have a battery&quot; as it runs &quot;entirely on hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has become known as the first wired president because of all his high-tech skills. And I think he showed that during the inaugural address, especially when he said, 'By working together we can turn our enemies into our BFFs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Daily News' says that Michelle Obama didn't wear her wedding ring to the inaugural ball because it didn't match her outfit. See, women can do that, huh? Imagine a guy trying to get away with that. Guy comes home, he's not wearing his wedding ring. 'Where's your ring?' 'You know, it clashed with my shirt.' Bam! 'Ow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caroline Kennedy...withdrew her bid to fill New York's vacant Senate seat. ... According to some reports, she dropped out because of marital problems. ... How bad is your marriage when it keeps you from replacing Hillary?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illinois Governor&quot; Rod Blagojevich's, &quot;impeachment trial is scheduled to begin on Monday,&quot; so it &quot;looks like Illinois is going to break even.&quot; They will &quot;have one politician sitting in the White House,&quot; and the &quot;other one sitting in the big house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The openly gay mayor of Portland, Oregon, Sam Adams,&quot; has &quot;admitted to having an affair with an 18-year-old male intern. See, that shows you how far gay rights have come in this country, when a homosexual politician can lie about his past, deceive his constituents, and have sex with his interns, just like our heterosexual politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course this was the inauguration week in Washington,&quot; and they &quot;have been hauling rubbish out&quot; in its wake. In fact, &quot;130 tons of garbage&quot; have been &quot;hauled out of Washington. And that's not including the previous administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House press corps is already complaining about the new press secretary, this guy Robert Gibbs. They're saying that he's not answering their questions. ... I think I know why&quot; the Obama Administration is &quot;being so secretive. They don't want anyone to know the truth -- that Barack Obama is Spider-Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's big business popping up around Obama. There's plates, coins, t-shirts, and now, the Chia company has immortalized him in clay. And what better way to honor a president than to have sprouts growing from his brain pan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also a Chia Biden, where you take sprouts from the back of the head and you transplant them into the front.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said today that the reality of becoming president has set in. So&quot; it sounds &quot;like the mother-in-law&quot; has &quot;already moved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out the classical music played by Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman at the inauguration last week was not performed live. ... Well, a lot people were very upset when they heard about this, especially Ashlee Simpson. She said, 'I could have done that gig.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of inauguration stuff is hitting the stores,&quot; including &quot;The Cat and Aretha Franklin's Hat,&quot; a &quot;new children's book&quot; that &quot;just came out today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Obama has signed an executive order closing Guantanamo Bay. ... Well, the big problem, how do you get these inmates back to their home countries? They're all on the do not fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I mean, what'll they do with them? I mean, look, most politicians...don't want them in their state or their district. Other countries don't want them. Although, today, New York City's Yellow Cab Company said, 'Hey, we'll take them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today President Obama has made very few changes to the Oval Office itself. He's keeping nearly everything President Bush had in there. Same desk, same chair, same pens. Well, sure, the stuff's like brand new. It was hardly ever used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of an awkward time for President Bush. He's too young to retire, yet still too old to destroy the moral and economic infrastructure of another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sam Adams, the openly gay mayor of Portland, Oregon, is being investigated for having an affair with a teenage male intern. You know, let me ask you. What happened to the good old days in this country, when if a politician wanted gay sex, by golly, he just tapped his foot three times in the men's room?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. Former French President Jacques Chirac was rushed to the hospital after being mauled by his clinically depressed poodle. See that's how you know that the French are not fighters, okay? When their leader is attacked by a maniacal poodle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Citigroup&quot; just &quot;got $45 billion of our tax dollars. Did you see what they bought themselves? They spent $50 million on a brand new, French-made private jet for their executives. Has a bar, private entertainment center, seating for 12. ... You know, if there's ever a reason to reopen Guantanamo Bay, this is it, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's our jet! ... We should be taking that. They should be on Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Illinois Governor&quot; Rod Blagojevich's &quot;impeachment trial got under way today. But he was not there. He didn't go. He went on 'The View' instead,&quot; which is a &quot;pretty smart&quot; move, because it &quot;will help his case when he pleads insanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the 'British Journal of Psychiatry,' marijuana can cause panic attacks, especially when you realize you're almost out of marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something shocking. Officials of Mendocino County, California, say two thirds of the income in that county comes from marijuana growing. Isn't that amazing? The other third comes from the sale of Chips Ahoy cookies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold outside. Lousy cold. Here is how cold it&quot; was. It was &quot;so cold today&quot; that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts &quot;screwed up while ordering chowder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was so cold, &quot;that thing on&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's &quot;head went into hibernation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, today, Governor Blagojevich is being impeached. ... Of course, the state of Illinois is already searching for&quot; a &quot;new crooked politician to take his place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know this? We have a brand-new Miss America,&quot; Katie Stam, from Indiana. They &quot;choose...Miss America based on personality,&quot; how &quot;the young woman looks in a swimsuit,&quot; and how she &quot;looks in...evening gowns.&quot; That &quot;is the competition. It's the same way that John McCain chooses a running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, speaking of John McCain, what a busy week in Washington last week. How about that? Wasn't that crazy?&quot; But John McCain &quot;had a busy week too. He was at Appleby's, blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is enjoying retirement in Crawford, Texas, maybe not as much as we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush is back at his place in Texas. It's known as...Rancho Inepto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush is &quot;not worrying about the country. No, it's like he's still president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I got to say, so far so good for the Obamas. ... The family is settled in. There's the President and his wife and the kids and the mother-in-law. And they're settling nicely. The only problem, the only complaint -- and they don't want to make trouble -- but the only complaint is they can still hear creepy organ music coming from Dick Cheney's dungeon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But moving out, Dick Cheney hurt his back. Did you hear about this?&quot; He was &quot;packing up his junk and...moving out&quot; of &quot;his office, and he hurt himself. So apparently, the door did just hit him in the ass on the way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a statistic I learned while watching the inauguration -- the White House has 16 bedrooms.&quot; And the &quot;only president to use each and every one of them was Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House&quot; also &quot;has three kitchens and the only president to use each and every one of them was Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of New York&quot; is &quot;now back up to full strength in terms of senators,&quot; because &quot;we have a brand new senator by the name of&quot; Kirsten Gillibrand. She &quot;is taking Hillary Clinton's old Senate seat,&quot; but the &quot;appointment took so long...and it got so stupid&quot; that &quot;the people up there in Albany&quot; were &quot;actually talking about bringing back Spitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But congratulations to Hillary Clinton,&quot; &quot;our new secretary of state,&quot; who &quot;was sworn in holding&quot; the &quot;Clinton family Bible. And it's a special edition,&quot; because &quot;Bill had removed four Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody,&quot; but it is &quot;a bad day for&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, whose &quot;impeachment began today.&quot; It turns out that Blagojevich &quot;said...he&quot; had considered &quot;Oprah Winfrey for the Senate. That's ridiculous! Oprah's way too powerful to waste her time in the Senate,&quot; although she has &quot;enough money to buy&quot; the seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, you could not watch television today without seeing&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who is &quot;saying all these crazy things about himself.&quot; Blagojevich &quot;did all these interviews, and in one of them, he compared himself to Martin Luther King. Yeah, Blagojevich said, 'I have a dream, and for 100 bucks, I'll tell you about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like the Obamas have already helped the economy. J. Crew stock has gone up 10%,&quot; because &quot;First Lady Michelle Obama has been spotted wearing their clothes. Which begs the question, Mr. Obama, how would you feel about wearing a Buick?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aretha Franklin, who sang at the inaugural, says she's not happy with her performance. She says the cold made it hard for her to sing. Yeah. Yeah, Aretha says she also got distracted when a weather satellite crashed into her hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This news just came out. When President Bush flew home to Texas last week, they apparently showed a video of his greatest accomplishments during the flight. Yeah, word has it the video got them most of the way through take-off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's replacement in the Senate,&quot; Kirsten Gillibrand, &quot;showed up to their joint press conference sporting a Hillary hairstyle and a nearly identical pantsuit,&quot; which &quot;explains why Bill Clinton was heard screaming, 'Good Lord, there's two of them!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda has unleashed a stream of verbal attacks against President Obama, calling him names and saying his policies will all end in failure. Well, who do these people think they are, Rush Limbaugh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama has given his first sit-down interview since&quot; he took the oath of office. He &quot;gave it to an Arabic television network, which seems kind of strange. I mean, if Barack Obama wanted to give interview to a network that's not seen in the United States, why not go with NBC?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of Arabs are upset with the interview because it preempted their most popular TV show, a Palestinian sitcom called '30 Rocks.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama said today when it comes to passing a stimulus package, 'We can't afford distractions' or 'delays.' And, of course, you know who took offense to this in Congress? The head of the Senate Distractions and Delays Committee. He was furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama has also signed an executive order officially banning torture in the United States. There goes Dick Cheney's retirement, huh?&quot; What is &quot;he supposed to do now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, last night, we talked about how Citigroup took $50 million of the bailout money we gave them&quot; and bought a &quot;corporate jet. ... Well, Citigroup now says...they were not going to take possession of the jet. They said they're going to lose money on it because they put a huge deposit on it, but they now realize it was a mistake.&quot; They &quot;said this is the most overpriced jet since Brett Favre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on 'Good Morning America,'&quot; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;said he considered offering the vacant Senate seat&quot; to Oprah Winfrey, &quot;but changed his mind when she wouldn't give him a car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And disgraced baseball player Jose Canseco fought&quot; to a draw with &quot;former child star Danny Bonaduce this past weekend in a celebrity boxing match.&quot; Did &quot;you ever see Canseco? He's huge! What is he, 80 pounds heavier and a foot taller than Danny Bonaduce? And he's on steroids! You still can't beat him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Quit politics and become a fat, lovable mall cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Start pronouncing last name with Jerry Lewis-like 'BLAGOOOOYYYYYJEVICH!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Offer a Senate seat with no money down, zero percent interest. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold outside&quot; right now. And &quot;I'm not a weatherman,&quot; but &quot;they say this frigid weather is coming off a cold front between&quot; New York Gov. David Paterson &quot;and Caroline Kennedy. That's causing a frost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out in the Midwest,&quot; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;was so cold he was trying to sell a Senate seat warmer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scary moment for Gov. Blagojevich earlier today. Several geese were sucked into his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to&quot; Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.&quot; There was an awkward &quot;moment at the big party&quot; they had in Roberts' office today when he &quot;screwed up the words to 'Happy Birthday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like that prison, that detention center, in Guantanamo Bay is being closed.&quot; And &quot;people say, 'Well, what are you going to do with all those folks who are down there, all those suspected terrorists and thugs and goons and nasty, awful people? ... We're going to bring them up here to the Ed Sullivan Theater and put them in the audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But listen to this. They're closing Guantanamo. That's how bad things are, ladies and gentlemen. That's how bad the economy is. You know it's tough, you know the economy is bad, when even the terrorists are being laid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the Obama family in the White House? ... Have you seen them? The kids?&quot; The Obama &quot;girls love living in the White House. They think it's fantastic. There was just one complaint that the girls had about living in the White House. They claim that...there's a portrait of Dick Cheney on the wall,&quot; and &quot;they claim...the eyes in that portrait actually move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's not all. At midnight,&quot; the Obama girls &quot;hear creepy organ music coming from&quot; Cheney's &quot;dungeon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Dick Cheney, you've got to give him credit. He's enjoying his first week as a private citizen.&quot; In fact, today, &quot;he was out hunting human prey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, Cheney is &quot;relaxing at his ranch, the Triple Bypass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. ... It's an amazing thing,&quot; but after &quot;eight years in office,&quot; former President George W. Bush &quot;is now in retirement.&quot; But how &quot;can you tell? Honestly. How can you tell?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for&quot; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is &quot;continuing on that media tour he's doing.&quot; Yesterday, he &quot;was on 'The View,' 'The Today Show,'&quot; and &quot;'Good Morning America.' Today, his hair was on...'Animal Planet' and 'Unsolved Mysteries.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is &quot;everywhere on television.&quot; Yesterday, he &quot;was interviewed by Geraldo Rivera.&quot; They &quot;billed it as 'an interview with the most hated man in America and Rod Blagojevich.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gov. Blagojevich is being criticized because he recently compared his experience to that of Nelson Mandela.&quot; That &quot;may be a stretch, but at least he got the prison part right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today,&quot; President Barack Obama's &quot;first interview as president with an Arabic news network&quot; was aired. He &quot;told the mostly Muslim nations that America has changed and said if they 'unclench their fist,' we will shake their hand. But they're hesitant because Bush told them the same thing and then got them with&quot; a &quot;joy buzzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain has confirmed that as rumored, his wife Cindy was approached to compete on 'Dancing with the Stars,' but they turned it down. I guess they figured the McCains have lost enough&quot; competitions &quot;already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in the world. As you know, President Barack Obama gave his first sit-down interview as president to an Arab TV network. He's reaching out to the Arab world. In fact, he even made a cameo appearance on one of the biggest sitcoms in the Arab world, 'How I Met Your Mullah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people are still talking about Michelle Obama's inaugural outfit. You know, I saw the designer on one of the cable shows and he said he didn't even know that Michelle was going to wear his design. He said he was watching the inaugural ball on TV and was surprised to see her wearing it.&quot; On a related note, &quot;the designer of Aretha Franklin's hat...said he was&quot; also &quot;surprised...when he saw Aretha wearing his design on her head because he originally designed it as a tote bag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And my favorite&quot; politician -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich -- was &quot;on the 'Today' show yesterday.&quot; And he &quot;compared himself to Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. Really? You see his hair? I think he's more like Skippy from 'Family Ties.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, earlier this week, all the e-mail service in the White House completely collapsed. No e-mails coming in, no e-mails...going out. Everything had to be written down on paper by hand. It was like if John McCain had been elected president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And freezing cold weather in Washington this week. The roads are so icy, Al Gore almost didn't make it to his global warming speech today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the Earth is in grave danger from global warming.&quot; But &quot;is this the best time to try to convince people that global warming is real, in the middle of a blizzard?&quot; He should come &quot;back in August when the air conditioner is broken, come out with a panting dog, and then maybe...people will listen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the 'Wall Street Journal' reports that Bill Clinton made $4.7 million last year in speaking fees from foreign countries. And they say this will cause a conflict for Hillary as secretary of state, but Bill has vowed not to cause any problems for her. And believe me, when Bill Clinton makes a vow to Hillary, you can take that to the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that&quot; a woman recently &quot;gave birth to eight babies? And out of force of habit, John Edwards went back into hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study finds that it takes humans 30% longer to lie than it does to tell the truth. See, that's why political speeches are so long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there's a new HBO documentary out about Ted Haggard. Remember him?&quot; He was the &quot;preacher that got caught with the male hooker?&quot; Well, this new film &quot;focuses on&quot; Haggard's &quot;relationship with his wife. I believe it's called 'He's Just Not That Into You.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know about this Rod Blagojevich, the governor from Illinois? Well, they're trying to get him out of there because he's a crook. And he was having an impeachment trial, and he said, 'You know what, you kids go and have your little impeachment trial. I'm going to New York City, and I'm going to be on every TV show.' Did you see the guy on TV? He was everywhere. I mean, this guy, he looks like the guy that tells you need new brake pads, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich &quot;looks like an insurance salesman that keeps calling you 'Captain.' 'Hey, Captain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich &quot;looks like a guy who backs you up with his aftershave. Whoah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich &quot;looks like a guy who disappears with your deposit after he takes your contracting contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich &quot;looks like the guy who tries to set you up with&quot; his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, after eight years, is also in retirement. How can you tell?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, of course, has a place just outside of Crawford, Texas -- Rancho Inepto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for...Al Gore,&quot; who &quot;went to Washington today to make a speech about the dangers of global warming, which is a bit...embarrassing because Washington is in the middle of a huge ice storm right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Al Gore &quot;will convince these lawmakers that global warming's something to be concerned about.&quot; Because Al Gore &quot;has done everything. He won a Nobel Prize, won an Oscar,&quot; and &quot;was elected president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama still has not gotten used to the White House, apparently. This is true. Today, on his way into the Oval Office, he tried to mistakenly open a window that he thought was a door. That's true. Yeah. White House employees said at first it made them laugh, then a wave of nostalgia washed over them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big snowstorm&quot; has &quot;hit the northeast,&quot; and &quot;President Obama...actually said this. He said that people in Washington can't handle harsh winter weather like people in Chicago.&quot; But, &quot;to be fair, Chicago is shielded from the snow and ice by the protective dome&quot; of Illinois Gov. Rod &quot;Blagojevich's hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge, huge winter storm&quot; in some parts of the country. In &quot;fact, it was so cold&quot; in &quot;Chicago, they froze out&quot; Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our studio audience might not know this,&quot; but &quot;a couple hours ago, Gov. Blagojevich was convicted and removed from office&quot; by a &quot;vote of 59-0. So close!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that's one corrupt politician down, 126,388 to go.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not over,&quot; because Blagojevich &quot;could still go to jail. In fact, he'll be the first Illinois governor to go to jail since the last one, and the one before that, then there were a couple more...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, boy, the Illinois senators were mad -- 59-0. Not only was&quot; he Blagojevich &quot;convicted, his hairdresser was given the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now, the lieutenant governor&quot; of Illinois &quot;will...move up and he'll be sworn in. And Blagojevich still doesn't get it. Like when he heard the lieutenant governor was going to get his seat, he said, 'You mean for free?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study in the journal 'Social Science Quarterly,'&quot; people &quot;who grow up with unpopular and strange sounding games are much more likely to be unsuccessful in life. I'll remember to tell that to President Barack Hussein Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Obama has outlawed torture. Although, he said, 'After listening to Rush Limbaugh, maybe I was a little too hasty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ooh, it's getting nasty now between President Obama and Rush Limbaugh. In fact, Limbaugh told his radio audience he's not going to 'bend over' and grab his ankles just because Barack Obama is black. Well, you know, let's...take race out of it for a minute. Now, honestly, regardless of who's president, do you think there's any chance in hell Rush Limbaugh could bend over and grab his ankles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he needs nearly a trillion dollars to help kick start the economy. ... That's a lot of money.&quot; Do &quot;you realize&quot; with that money, &quot;you could give every man and woman and child in this country $3,300?&quot; Or you &quot;could buy shoes for everyone in South America for life.&quot; Or you &quot;could cover the New York Yankees' payroll for a season and a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the tough economic times, the 'LA Daily News'&quot; is &quot;no longer sending a sportswriter to cover&quot; games played by NBA basketball's LA Clippers. So &quot;I guess covering Clipper games falls under Obama's new law banning torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, is readjusting to life as a private citizen. God, you think after eight years of tense talks with hostile tyrants, she would have had enough, but no, today, she was on 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now growing proof that some of the relief money that was supposed to help victims of the huge earthquake in China was actually siphoned off by corrupt officials. In fact, one corrupt&quot; official, Chang Blagojevich, &quot;was arrested today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard at the Meeting Between Barack Obama and the Republicans:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'I miss the Clinton administration, when we'd meet at Hooters.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Can we wrap this up? I've got tickets to the 4:30 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Smoke break!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'You fellas really need to take it easy on the Old Spice.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Mr. President: don't misunderestimate the Republicans.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Another smoke break!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'What was the deal with Aretha Franklin's hat?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'About that tax the rich stuff -- you were joking, right?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Sir, it's refreshing to have a Chief Executive who speaks in complete sentences.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Senator Craig's offering his stimulus package in the men's room?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold everywhere. Listen how cold it is.&quot; It is so &quot;cold out in Illinois, the state of Illinois impeached Al Roker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 2002, President Bush, do you remember this, the access of evil speech? Do you remember his axis of evil? Do you remember what the axis of evil was? Iran, Iraq, Dick Cheney. That was the axis of evil right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich was &quot;impeached today back there in Springfield. And he spoke in his defense at the impeachment proceedings, spoke for 47 minutes. And it really took its toll on the guy,&quot; because afterwards, &quot;they had to rush him to the emergency room at Supercuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you taken a good look at this Rod Blagojevich? I mean, he looks like the producer of an adult entertainment awards show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich looks &quot;like your wife's ex-husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich looks &quot;like the guy at the high school reunion who knows everything about you and you have no idea who he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich looks &quot;like the guy that goes to a family barbeque and criticizes how you arrange the charcoal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich looks &quot;like a guy who claims to know Jon Lovitz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Blagojevich, I would not give this guy's troubles to a monkey on a rock. It is one headache after another for this Blagojevich. It turns out, next month, his hair goes digital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's good news. I guess&quot; the House of Representatives &quot;has passed President Obama's stimulus package. And then I guess it goes through the Senate. And if that's passed, then that $800 billion, just disappears. Have no idea where it goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And anybody who has kids, of course, is nervous about the Obama girls,&quot; who have had to &quot;change homes&quot; and &quot;change schools. And it is just crazy.&quot; But the &quot;good news&quot; is &quot;the girls love living in the White House. ... They do have one complaint, though. Sometimes, at midnight, when the moon is full, they can hear the squeaking hinges on Dick Cheney's coffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Dick Cheney, you know, he's in retirement now. But he's not just sitting around, taking it easy, oh, no. He's...active. He's got things going on.&quot; For example, he &quot;booked himself on the show, 'Sneering with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a bad day for&quot; Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. The &quot;state senate kicked him out.&quot; So &quot;today, Blagojevich did what any smart criminal in Illinois would do. He asked Oprah for a pardon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, in response to President Obama's stimulus package, Rush Limbaugh...proposed&quot; in his own &quot;stimulus package. That's true. You see, that's what this country needs. What we need is a stimulus package proposed by a fat DJ. That's what's going to set the country back on track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Rush Limbaugh's stimulus package is just a package containing a big bottle of stimulants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are really looking bad&quot; for Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Political &quot;experts are wondering what his future will hold.&quot; But &quot;on the bright side for Blagojevich, he has been offered a job as the 'before' picture at Supercuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, on CNN,&quot; they have &quot;been showing a blueprint, all week, of the White House to help viewers visualize the layout of the West Wing. Yeah, when he saw it, former President Bush said, 'So that's where the bathroom was.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, there's been an increase in the number of illegal Mexican immigrants living in Canada. Yeah. Yeah, you got the hand it to them. That must be some tunnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC says they will probably cancel the sitcom 'According to Jim,'&quot; which &quot;means...Barack Obama's message of hope is already working.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Oprah Winfrey's 55th birthday. ... I feel bad for Stedman on Oprah's birthday. What do you get the woman who has her own president? Do you sacrifice a lamb or something? You can't make a mixed tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state Senate&quot; in Illinois &quot;stayed in session...today to finish the impeachment trial of Governor Rod Blagojevich,&quot; who &quot;decided to show up today. He spoke for 47 minutes before they were able to nab him with a butterfly net and some Aqua Net.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blagojevich showed that a high-ranking politician in the United States can be disgraced without hookers or gay sex in a public bathroom and I think that's refreshing, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, our president, President Obama, will make his first trip overseas to Canada next month. It's an historic visit, not just because it's his first foreign trip, but because he'll be the first black person ever to visit Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is going because Canada is such an important friend to the United States and because he always wanted to visit the birth place of Alan Thicke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all ready for the Super Bowl? ... Well, here's some...trivia. Cardinals starting quarterback Kurt Warner&quot; is the &quot;third oldest starting quarterback in Super Bowl history.&quot; Is &quot;that a good omen? I think...recent history&quot; has &quot;not been kind to old guys from Arizona trying to win stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy TGIF! You know what TGIF stands for? The Governor Is Fired, that's what it stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is now &quot;out of a job. He's disgraced. He's unpopular. In fact, today, he got a note from President Bush saying, 'Hey, welcome to the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Blagojevich &quot;keeps demanding he's innocent.&quot; And &quot;at his hearing the other day,&quot; he said that &quot;with the 'exception of those four tapes' you 'heard, there hasn't been any evidence to show or prove any criminal conduct.' You know, except for the 'four tapes that you heard.' Except for the evidence, there hasn't been any evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Blagojevich &quot;said today, he loves 'the people of Illinois' more today than he ever has before.&quot; And &quot;the people of Illinois said, 'You know, we're just not that into you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; Blagojevich &quot;will not go away.&quot; In fact, he &quot;just came out with his own shampoo&quot; called &quot;Gee, Your Hair Looks Ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Just a couple of hours ago, the Republican Party elected Michael Steele as the first African-American chairman of the GOP. So that shows you, the Republican Party isn't just for stuffy old white guys anymore. There's plenty of room for stuffy old black guys too now. As long as you're stuffy, you're in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Times,' President Obama having a more relaxed White House dress code than the Bush Administration, although not nearly as relaxed a dress code as the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this week, all the e-mail service at the White House completely collapsed, boom, gone. So I guess they run on Windows Vista, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of cutbacks. Post office says they may have to cut back on mail days.&quot; By &quot;law, the Post Office has to ask Congress for permission if they want to do less work. Boy, they certainly&quot; would be going &quot;to the right people there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; was &quot;furious about this today. Despite last year, Wall Street executives gave themselves $18 billion, not million, $18 billion in bonuses. ... Imagine how much they would have gotten if they did a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's&quot; in &quot;bad shape.&quot; In fact, a &quot;Girl Scout came to my door last night. You know what she was selling? Crystal meth. I couldn't believe it. It's terrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold today in New York that Gov. Paterson...spent six weeks picking out a new sweater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So cold down in Washington, DC, today&quot; that &quot;President Obama had Joe Biden go outside and take his smoke break for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, the Super Bowl&quot; will be played this Sunday. This will be &quot;Super Bowl 43,&quot; and &quot;I don't know what kind of game it's going to be,&quot; but &quot;it can't be any worse than President 43.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is out of Washington. He's back at his place in&quot; Texas. He has &quot;got a big spread just outside of Crawford&quot; called &quot;Rancho Inepto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But George Bush, don't worry about him right now. He's very busy working on plans for his library. Because when you think Bush, you think library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dick Cheney is enjoying his retirement.&quot; For example, today, &quot;Dick was relaxing, feeding baby mice to his python.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited&quot; and &quot;I think everybody is about the Obama Administration. I mean they get in there, they're doing stuff. They're...active. They're not reactive. They're actually out there doing stuff, as opposed to being squirrelly and defensive all the time. I mean, we had eight years of defensive squirrels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But listen to this.&quot; Obama &quot;wants to reopen the crown of the Statue of liberty. ... Not only that, he plans to open that thing&quot; on former Illinois Gov. Rod &quot;Blagojevich's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I Don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that John McCain is from Arizona, but President Obama says he is rooting for the Steelers&quot; in Sunday's Super Bowl. In &quot;fact, he's so confident that Pittsburgh is going to win, he's parlaying $100 million of the stimulus package on the Steelers and the under.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama lashed out this week at big bonuses being paid to executives at banks that asked for bailout money. This is unbelievable! Banks that had to be bailed out by taxpayers paid something like $18 billion in bonuses to their executives. Obama called it 'shameful' and 'the height of irresponsibility.' He even called the banks to complain, but unfortunately, he wound up talking to a guy named Mahesh, who said there was nothing he could do.&quot; Obama then &quot;asked to speak&quot; to Mahesh's supervisor, but he was put &quot;on hold for two hours&quot; before eventually getting &quot;disconnected. So this is a nightmare, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very exciting&quot; Super Bowl on Sunday, and &quot;they said every seat at Raymond James Stadium was a good seat. Unless, of course, you were sitting behind Aretha Franklin. 'Hey, lady, the hat. Take the hat off, lady.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to former Vice President Dick Cheney,&quot; who is now &quot;68 years old. So...you know what that means? He beat the spread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the half brother of Barack Obama, a man named George Obama, has been arrested in Kenya for allegedly having drugs. See, here we go again with the dumb presidential brothers. Remember Billy Carter?&quot; Then &quot;there was Roger Clinton, Bill Clinton's brother. See, we never had that problem with President Bush. He was already the dumb brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a huge scientific breakthrough today. Researchers say they are very close to finding someone from Obama's Cabinet who's actually paid their taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Daschle,&quot; whom &quot;President Obama wants...as secretary of health and human services, apparently did not pay $128,000 in taxes that he owes the government. Did you realize President Obama hasn't had a cabinet member with an embarrassing tax problem like this since the last guy they appointed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele has become the first African-American Republican National Committee chairman ever. ... Black Republicans said they were thrilled. Both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of our huge budget crisis, California's now going to delay paying your tax refunds, to which Tom Daschle said, 'That's why I didn't pay them in the first place.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right after&quot; Sunday's Super Bowl, President Barack Obama placed &quot;a congratulatory phone call to the Steelers from his BlackBerry.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;John McCain called the Cardinals from his ham radio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to love a guy like John McCain, but stuff is not going his way.&quot; He had &quot;a huge Super Bowl party,&quot; but people &quot;started clapping. And every time they did, the lights would go on and off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Groundhog Day,&quot; and &quot;I don't know why this stuff always goes haywire in Alaska. ... Here is what happened. A little bit of trouble. Groundhog comes out of its hole. Sarah Palin shoots it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Groundhog Day, everybody! ... Earlier today, the groundhog came out of his hole, and Sarah Palin shot it. Six more weeks of winter. You betcha!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Post Office announced&quot; they &quot;could run out of cash by the end of the year. ... They said they're in serious danger of becoming a bank. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, the economy is so bad, even people who have nothing to do with the Obama Administration aren't paying their taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination for secretary of health and human services after being forced to pay $128,000 in back taxes.&quot; Daschle &quot;was extremely upset because now it looks like he paid his taxes for nothin'!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what really did Tom Daschle in? It turns out there are now pictures of him partying with Michael Phelps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tax problems for another Obama nominee. Nancy Killefer has withdrawn her nomination as White House chief performance officer. Not only did she not pay her taxes, she had a tax lien put on her house by the government. Where is Obama getting these nominees? Old episodes of 'Cops'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You realize Obama would have less tax problems if he had nominated Willie Nelson and Wesley Snipes. They...actually have better records than most of these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of frightening. Al Gore told Congress last week...the global warming scenario is worse than previously predicted. Worse than predicted? Wasn't the first prediction we're all going to fry to death? Huh? What's worse than that?&quot; Is it going to &quot;be humid, too? Is that it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was on this...very day in 1690 that the very first paper money in America was issued in Massachusetts. It was issued by a man named Merrill Lynch, who used the money to give himself the first huge bonus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Smithsonian Institute wants the hat that Aretha Franklin wore at President Obama's inauguration. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;is on the show tonight, ladies and gentlemen. I hope that thing on his head doesn't bite me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like&quot; Blagojevich. He &quot;looks like your neighbor who never returns the tools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aren't you tired of bad economic news, ladies and gentlemen?&quot; Well, here is some &quot;good economic news. President Obama has a great new economic plan.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Daschle has withdrawn his cabinet nomination because he had some tax problems. Forgot about $150,000. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great day for us here at the show but not a great day for Batman, or as he's known in real life, actor Christian Bale.&quot; Bale was &quot;all over the Internet today. Have you heard that tape? We can't play it for you, because some of the language&quot; is &quot;not appropriate for TV. ... Almost everyone who's heard this tape says it's offensive,&quot; but former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich disagreed, calling &quot;it 'amateur,'&quot; and &quot;'not cussy enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, the Republican National Committee&quot; elected &quot;their first ever African-American chairman. ... His name is Michael Steele, or as he's known in the Republican Party, 'the black guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today,&quot; Tom Daschle &quot;withdrew his nomination to be the health and human services secretary after it was revealed he didn't pay back taxes. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day on the set of CNN, disgraced&quot; former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;was criticized for using the f-word. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, Blagojevich was talking about his f-ing barber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is &quot;denying a rumor that his wife Cindy will be a contestant on the upcoming season of 'Dancing with the Stars.' ... When asked why, McCain said, 'Dance? Are you kidding? I've never even seen her blink.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The producers of this year's Academy Awards&quot; are &quot;worried about the ratings,&quot; so they &quot;are making several changes to the show to try to increase&quot; viewership.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama,&quot; before Sunday's Super Bowl, &quot;did an interview with Matt Lauer,&quot; during &quot;which he predicted the Steelers would win a squeaker, and sure enough, they did.&quot; So &quot;it's a shame he didn't bet the deficit&quot; on the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, the President has a half brother named George Obama, who lives in Kenya, and George Obama was arrested on Saturday for possession of marijuana. He was walking around the village telling people his brother was the President, so they assumed he was high and arrested him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How great is that, though? One brother is the President of the United States, the other is a stoner in Kenya. If that...isn't a sitcom, I don't know what is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, is Africa really the place you want to get the munchies? It...isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Barack Obama is a genius. I think this is part of the plan.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Tom Daschle withdrew his name to be in Obama's cabinet, due to IRS problems. Yeah, he said, 'I will not be a distraction.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; you know &quot;that woman here in California who just had the eight kids and has six more at home?&quot; Well, &quot;today, Tom Daschle proposed to her. He's not in love, he just needs the deductions. 'Please marry me, please!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House issued a statement today saying that the reason their nominees are having such trouble is that the new White House has set the bar very high. See, that shows you what's wrong with politics in this country. That's what the government considers setting the bar high, having to pay taxes like everybody else in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Obama announced a salary cap of $500,000 for executives at banks and companies that have received taxpayer bailout money. And you know -- it is good. But I'll tell you something,&quot; you &quot;can tell a lot of these CEOs don't get it. They said, 'Well, that's $500,000 a month, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wells Fargo, who got...almost $25 billion in bailout money,&quot; has &quot;canceled a pricey 12-day corporate trip to Las Vegas.&quot; And &quot;I think they learned their lesson,&quot; because &quot;they really scaled&quot; things &quot;back. They're not doing Vegas anymore. Now, it's a one-day pie eating contest in Laughlin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Citigroup, who received a huge bailout from the government, owns the naming rights to the New York Mets' new stadium.&quot; It is currently called Citi Field,&quot; but &quot;because of Barack Obama's crackdown on the Federal bailout money,&quot; Citigroup will &quot;legally&quot; have &quot;to change the name of the stadium&quot; to &quot;Money Grubbing Bastards&quot; Field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House...Nancy Pelosi&quot; recently said that &quot;every month that we do not have an economic recovery package, '500 million Americans lose their jobs.' ... I think the Botox is starting to seep into&quot; her &quot;brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the US Postal Service says they may cut postal service from six days to five days a week. They say they're losing money because people aren't using the postal service as much as they used to. If you'd like to complain, you can e-mail the complaint to uspostalservice.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new US energy secretary predicts agriculture in California will disappear in this century because of global warming. He said people in California will no longer grow crops, except those who are growing them in their basements, attics, and garages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either today or yesterday, Barack Obama said Americans are 'sick and tired' of people 'being rewarded for failure.' ... Is he talking about me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry you folks weren't here last night,&quot; because &quot;you missed a big show.&quot; Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;was here.&quot; You &quot;know, it's funny. The audience really liked him,&quot; but &quot;they impeached me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was fun to have Rod Blagojevich on the program,&quot; because &quot;for one night, I was not the creepiest guy on the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, while you were applauding that joke, another Obama nominee dropped out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this? Obama has now lost two nominees because of tax trouble. ... So good luck to the new Health and Human Services nominee, Wesley Snipes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Senator Tom Daschle from South Dakota&quot; had &quot;to withdraw because...he forgot to pay taxes.&quot; You &quot;know, I...believe the guy because in South Dakota, there are so many distractions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dick Cheney? He's out of office,&quot; but &quot;he's still chomping at the bit. You know what I'm talking about? Daschle embarrasses Obama so today Obama gets a call from Cheney, 'Hey, let me waterboard him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was stunned&quot; by the Daschle story because &quot;we don't expect Democrats to cheat on their taxes. No, we expect Democrats to cheat on their wives. That's how this is supposed to go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;going to put a salary cap on execs working for companies that take...government bailout money. ... Finally, some accountability in Washington. But I'm thinking if they are going introduce accountability, shouldn't Obama start by making his own people pay their taxes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's &quot;cabinet picks must've gone to the Willie Nelson School of Taxpaying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has asked the Senate to cut $50 billion from the economic stimulus plan. ... Yeah. Obama says the government will no longer need the $50 billion once everyone in his cabinet pays their back taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that&quot; Tom Daschle &quot;has withdrawn his nomination, the White House is thinking of replacing him with the CEO of Safeway supermarkets. That's true. Yeah, the White House said they should be able to check him out quickly if he has eight items or less.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in Washington, President Obama took time out from his busy day to read a book to a group of second graders. Did you see that on the news? It was a fairy tale about a cabinet nominee who once paid all his taxes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It came out today that the House Democratic Caucus spent $500,000 of taxpayers' money for retreats at luxury resorts and spas. The Democrats say the time was used for strategic planning for the country. ... So, the resorts are being used for strategic planning. Really? Then what is the Capitol building for? Hello?! Hello?! Isn't this work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this -- according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' the city of Las Vegas wants to use $2 million worth of the economic stimulus package for neon signs. ... I just hope it doesn't make the city look tacky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to just ruin everybody's day,&quot; but there is &quot;discouraging news everywhere. Unemployment is high. Foreclosure rate is high. Michael Phelps is high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that Rod Blagojevich? You know who I am talking about?&quot; The &quot;former governor of Illinois&quot; was &quot;on the program...Tuesday. He looks like the guy who would sell you retractable awnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blagojevich &quot;looks like a guy who runs out of bullets and then throws his gun at Superman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, here's something chilling.&quot; Former Vice President Dick Cheney &quot;is now warning that there will be another terrorist attack. He got that information by waterboarding himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another one&quot; of President Barack Obama's nominees &quot;is having tax issues, which proves one thing: The Democrats like raising the taxes,&quot; but &quot;they hate paying them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is back in the news as well. She's been criticizing anonymous bloggers. She calls them 'pathetic.' Apparently she feels that unknown people should not be criticizing politicians, unless the unknown person is running for vice president. Then it's all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bad here in California. ... The unemployment here is the worst it's been in 25 years. Here's how bad the unemployment situation is in Hollywood. Right now, people are begging to work with Christian Bale.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama getting very tough now, has imposed a $500,000 salary cap for executives getting Federal bailout money. And listen to this -- not only that, on weekends, they can only play miniature golf. No more 18 hole.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the whole theory behind the salary cap is if you're not performing well and you're taking taxpayer money, then that should be reflected in lower wages. Of course, under that&quot; kind of &quot;criteria, everybody in Congress should get what, two bucks an hour or something like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is 'Furlough Friday' here in California,&quot; where the &quot;state is so broke, 200,000 state workers are asked to stay home without pay as a cash saving measure. This is what I love about California. They make it sound like it's fun. 'Oh, Furlough Friday!' What's the next big holiday? 'Selling Your Blood for Money Saturday?' Is that it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like more than 13,000 people were caught up in that Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. You know what a Ponzi scheme is? That's where you throw good money after bad or, as the government calls it, 'a stimulus package.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the job market&quot; is &quot;no day at the beach either. ... Oh, yeah, today, the Border Patrol stopped a van of illegal aliens trying to sneak into Mexico. That's how bad&quot; it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are sick and tired of the cold weather. Here's how cold it was today in Washington, DC.&quot; Vice President Joe Biden &quot;put his foot in his mouth just to keep it warm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday is&quot; the Westminster Kennel Club's 133rd Annual Dog Show, where dogs are judged on &quot;appearance,&quot; so every &quot;dog is groomed,&quot; blow dried, and &quot;flea dipped. You know, it's the same thing they did&quot; to former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich &quot;for the impeachment trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama&quot; has &quot;relaxed the White House dress code. ... He's the first president to do that since Bill Clinton, who&quot; of &quot;course, established 'Pants-Free Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Word out of the Senate tonight is that a deal has been reached on a $780 billion stimulus package. It's said to include a mixture of tax cuts, infrastructure spending, healthcare stipends, and ponies for everyone in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the jobless rate has jumped to 7.6%, the worst since 1974,&quot; and economists are now &quot;worried this could lead to a resurgence of disco.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy is in bad shape.&quot; In fact, the &quot;economy is so bad,&quot; President Barack Obama's &quot;new slogan&quot; is &quot;'Spare Change You Can Believe In.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Barack Obama held his first press conference as President of the United States,&quot; and it was &quot;fascinating because his press conferences are very different than the George Bush press conferences in many ways.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss the President Bush news conference. Like when they asked him a question, he'd go, 'Uh, can I have a hint?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Minnesota, Republican Norm Coleman, who is in a legal fight with Al Franken over who won the election for Senate, said, 'God wants me to serve.'&quot; But here is &quot;my question. How bad a candidate are you&quot; if &quot;you can't win an election when you have the creator of the universe on your side?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay has filed to run for governor of California. ... Well, that makes sense. I mean, the state's broke. If we're going to start selling stuff, who better to be governor than the head of eBay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Louisiana,&quot; a &quot;porn star named Stormy Daniels&quot; announced that &quot;before she commits to running for US Senate,&quot; she will go &quot;on a statewide listening tour.&quot; Daniels added, and &quot;I'm quoting&quot; here, that she may &quot;'be a slut and a whore, but'&quot; she is &quot;'not a criminal.'&quot; But &quot;this is why she will never win. See, in the Senate, you have to be all three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about President Barack Obama's first primetime press conference last night? ... He was cogent,&quot; eloquent, and in &quot;complete command of the issues. I'm thinking to myself, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said he still believes in bipartisanship and he pledges to work with the Republicans to reduce the size of Jessica Simpson,&quot; who has reportedly put on some weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, when President Obama -- this is true -- was getting into his helicopter, he accidentally bumped his head on the door. It was in the news,&quot; and when &quot;he heard about it, President Bush said, 'See, it's complicated, right? It's not so easy. Doors are hard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Barack Obama went to Florida and gave a big speech on the economy. ... Obama's speech was interrupted five times by applause and six times by old people whispering, 'Is he Cuban?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate&quot; has passed an $838 billion stimulus bill. That is &quot;just under $3,000 for each person in America. And here's how it's going to work. On March 1st, every American will receive a roll of 30 $100 Obama stimulus coins. And you can either trade the coins with your friends or you can use them in special machines to buy stimulus nutrition bars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the Democrats in the Senate and three Republicans voted for&quot; the stimulus bill. President Barack Obama &quot;says it's going to take a lot of time before Republicans warm up to his many appeals for bipartisanship. The biggest hurdle, I guess, is how do you convince Republicans that being bipartisan doesn't mean you have to have sex with other dudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He said he feels bad because he was stupid for three years, to which&quot; former President George W. Bush &quot;said, 'Hey, try it for eight years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, the heads of the eight largest banks testified before Congress. Bank CEOs in a room full of politicians -- they had to flip a coin to see who's going to tell the first lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner?&quot; He gave &quot;testimony on Capitol Hill&quot; today, but &quot;it drew lukewarm response. So, Timothy, welcome to the club!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to be critical this early into the new Administration, but I don't know if this Timothy Geithner is the guy for the job. He may not be up to it. Turns out, he thought the Treasury Secretary...was in charge of buried treasure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? It's a good example of how strange things are and how time flies. On this date&quot; in 2006, &quot;then-Vice President Dick Cheney shot his buddy in the face.&quot; Tell &quot;me again why he's not in jail? How did that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? A celebrity birthday.&quot; Today is Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's &quot;birthday. ... I'm not saying how old Sarah Palin is, but from her house, she can see 50.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is &quot;actually 45 years old today, and just to tell you a little something about me -- Sarah Palin, I think, is the first vice presidential candidate that I have pictured naked. Well, since Lloyd Bentsen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin had a big birthday celebration up there in Alaska. She celebrated by shooting wolf cubs from a helicopter.&quot; Later, &quot;she shot the cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you have a feeling it's going to be a long time before we have a vice president who shoots a guy in the face? Just doesn't happen that often.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody,&quot; but a &quot;very tough day for the President.&quot; Another &quot;Obama Cabinet pick has withdrawn his name from contention.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday,&quot; and to &quot;honor the occasion, the US Mint is releasing a new penny that shows Lincoln's house. That's appropriate because that's about how much a house is worth these days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidents' Day, of course, the day we honor presidents Washington and Lincoln. And Saturday was, of course, Valentine's Day, the day we celebrate President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress passed the biggest spending bill in US history: $787 billion. The newspapers said today not one politician in Washington has read the bill, to which President Bush said, 'See, nobody reads that stuff! Who says I have no legacy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see this? In a new ranking...of US presidents by 65 historians, President Bush came in fifth from the bottom. Of course, Bush was thrilled. That's better than he did in high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After withdrawing his name&quot; for commerce secretary, Sen. Judd Gregg &quot;said...he hoped he was just embarrassing himself and not President Obama, to which Joe Biden said, 'Don't worry about it. I do it all the time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems with the Democrats. Republicans are now calling for the new Illinois Sen. Roland Burris to resign after he apparently lied to investigators about talking to Rod Blagojevich's brother about campaign money. Rod Blagojevich has a brother?&quot; How &quot;bad is his hair?

During that time, they have had &quot;Preppie Barbie,&quot; Wedding Barbie, and &quot;Republican Running Mate Barbie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something exciting. Hillary Clinton, our secretary of state, is on her first big round the world trip. She's visiting Asia, including a stop in China,&quot; where she &quot;is trying to do something about those leaky takeout food cartons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Hillary &quot;is in Asia, Bill is in heaven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll of historians just came out. And the poll has named former President George W. Bush one of the ten worst presidents of all time.&quot; But on &quot;the bright side, Bush was selected second best president named George Bush.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Yesterday, one of President Obama's top advisors said that choosing cabinet members is not like picking 'American Idol.' Yeah, mainly because the 'American Idol' contestants have paid their taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marvel Comics has come out with a special edition comic book where Spider-Man and Captain America go back in time to watch Abraham Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg Address.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, Presidents Day. And Congress commemorated George Washington's throwing a dollar across the Potomac by tossing $787 billion down a rat hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they said the stimulus package will give people an extra $13 in their paychecks. So, next time the bank starts closing in, you go, 'Hey, hey, hey! I got 13 smackaroonies coming in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, you got to admit, President Obama gives great speeches. ... Like, today,&quot; instead &quot;of just saying, 'Oh, from North to South,' he said, 'From the windy plains of the Dakotas to the sunny skies of Arizona.'&quot; That sounds &quot;so much better than, 'From the sleaze ball criminal element of Wall Street to the broke-a@# beaches of California.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are a lot of new taxes coming. California state legislators want to solve our state's giant deficit by&quot; taxing &quot;marijuana.&quot; Meanwhile, Oregon &quot;wants to increase a tax on beer,&quot; while &quot;New York wants to tax Internet porn. You know what this means? By the end of spring break, this whole thing could be paid for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something I learned on the Discovery Channel.&quot; Researchers &quot;say...that animals actually plan for the future. ... And I think it's true. For example, do you know that most animals sold all their stocks at the end of 2006?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And one of the hardest hit businesses in this failing economy&quot; is &quot;plastic surgery. Fewer and fewer people are getting plastic surgery.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the &quot;economy's in bad shape.&quot; It is in such bad shape that today, &quot;three stock brokers tried to kill themselves by eating peanuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And California ? that's no day at the beach either. Oh, California, I tell you. Today, I saw Governor Schwarzenegger dyeing his hair with an orange Sharpie. 'You godda get da color back in dere.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Venezuela, a referendum passed that will allow Hugo Chavez to keep running for president indefinitely.&quot; So down there, it will be kind &quot;of like&quot; what &quot;Ralph Nader does here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in Mexico found a pickup truck&quot; with &quot;side panels and...bumpers&quot; that &quot;were made entirely of cocaine.&quot; Police &quot;got suspicious when the guy had a minor fender bender and claimed $2.5 million in damages.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Hillary Clinton Wants To Accomplish On Her Trip Overseas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Exchange US dollars for currency that's worth something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Win respect defeating Japan's top-ranked sumo wrestler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Shift world's perception of America from 'hated' to 'extremely disliked.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Personally thank all of her illegal campaign donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Three words: stylish Indonesian pantsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Visit burial site of revered Chinese military leader, General Tso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Get drunk with that Japanese finance minister guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Convince China to switch from lead-tainted products to mercury-tainted products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Catch Chinese screening of Benjamin Button entitled 'The Strange Adventures of Freaky Grandpa Baby.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pick up carton of duty-free smokes for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Hillary Clinton?&quot; She has been &quot;married to Bubba for quite a while.&quot; Well, she is &quot;now the secretary of state,&quot; and she is on her &quot;first big round the world tour.&quot; She is on &quot;her big Asian tour. She wants to normalize relations with North Korea. No word yet about normalizing relations with Bill.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were talking to Hillary about what Bill gave her for Valentine's Day,&quot; and &quot;I thought this was surprising ? sexy lingerie. Well, he had to after she found it in his glove compartment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you something. You think it's tough in New York City, California is bankrupt. Yeah, things are so -- here's how bad things are California. They've canceled the next three mudslides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't get. President Obama&quot; was in Denver today, where &quot;he signed the $789 billion stimulus package. That's great, isn't it? What do we do when that money's gone? Where is that money going? I'm not getting any, you getting any? No, nobody's getting any. Six months, it'll be gone, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, while&quot; Obama's &quot;signing the stimulus package bill in Denver, John McCain...was busy at Denny's, sectioning his grapefruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says that the bad economy can lower&quot; testosterone levels in men. Scientists &quot;say at this rate, by the end of the decade, Anne Coulter could be a woman!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'Financial Times,'&quot; Barack Obama, &quot;they're saying, is moving towards Swedish models of banking. A president moving towards Swedish models? That hasn't happened since the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very worried about the economy. Hopefully,&quot; our problems &quot;will be over soon. And I think&quot; they &quot;will be because today, President Obama finally signed the stimulus bill,&quot; which &quot;is supposed to create 3.5 million jobs. It'll fund new roads&quot; and &quot;new bridges. They've even put aside $8 billion for new trains. I smell&quot; Vice President Joe Biden. He &quot;loves trains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only three Republicans voted for the stimulus bill. The rest are withholding their votes so that they can blame Obama if it doesn't work, which is perfectly acceptable. This is what politicians do.&quot; But &quot;I saw an article last week&quot; that &quot;said, 'Is Obama's Presidency already a failure?'&quot; What &quot;I think has happened to Obama is this.&quot; It is &quot;kind of like George W. Bush was in the restroom before him and then came out and went away. And Obama's gone in and he's found something awful there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think everybody&quot; should &quot;just calm down. Give Obama four years. See what he can do. Then if he's a miserable failure, we'll do what we did with&quot; George W. Bush and elect &quot;him to a second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have four shows left, including tonight. ... It's weird, I was thinking about it today. When we went on the air in 1993, I had no way of knowing that 16 years later we'd have an African-American president.&quot; Then again, Barack Obama &quot;had no way of knowing that an albino would be taking over 'The Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama today signed his trillion dollar economic stimulus Bill into law.&quot; The &quot;spending package passed through Congress with almost no Republican support, but Obama says he's still focused on bringing real bipartisanship to government. He even went so far as to send every Republican in Congress today a jar of peanuts, which I thought was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

You know, I'm no financial expert, but if you have no money and no prospects of making money and you owe $42 billion, you're way beyond putting yourself on a budget, okay?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics say...the problem is people don't understand&quot; what is &quot;in the budget.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama signed the stimulus bill in Denver, Colorado. He picked Denver because our debt is now a mile high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, today, outlined his plan to deal with the mortgage mess and the housing crisis. The good news -- he thinks he's found a solution. The bad news -- it involves arson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the idea of nationalizing banks is becoming more popular with some lawmakers and economists. They say they're leaning towards the Swedish model for banks. You know, I've got a better idea. How about opening banks with all Swedish models.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest on the bailout. Democrats may have to bail Senator Roland Burris out of jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for Senator Burris. Now, the 'Chicago Sun-Times'&quot; is &quot;calling for his resignation. Remember, he was appointed by Governor Blagojevich. Now he could be in trouble for perjury and for giving conflicting statements in his testimony about campaign contributions. ... See, that's the trouble with politicians. They think the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth are three different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the 'New York Times'&quot; is &quot;reporting that, in his last days in office, Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly went to President Bush to try to get him to pardon Scooter Libby, and he was furious that Bush wouldn't do it. They say Cheney is now bitter. Yeah, as opposed to the happy go lucky zippity-do-da Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a new ranking of US presidents by 65 historians, President Bush came in fifth from the bottom. And here's the bad part -- the margin of error&quot; was &quot;five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with Fox News, Governor Sarah Palin's daughter, 18-year-old Bristol Palin -- remember Bristol Palin, who had the baby? Well, she talked in the interview. She said, 'A year ago, I never would have thought I would become a mom or that my mom was going to be chosen to be a vice presidential candidate.' Oddly enough, both things happened because some guy failed to take the proper precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of state Hillary Clinton is in Asia. She is in Japan, or as Bill was heard telling a woman in a bar last night, 'We're separated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's auto makers have asked the government-- Remember when&quot; America's auto makers &quot;flew into Washington in their private jets and said, 'We're busted. We'd like several hundred billion dollars.' Well, they're coming back again. They're asking for $22 billion&quot; in &quot;additional...taxpayer money. ...I mean, these guys are like the world's most expensive brother-in-law, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is on her first world trip around the world as secretary of state. She's on tour in Asia. Hillary's in Asia. Bill's in heaven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, Hillary is visiting China. She's trying to stop the proliferation of doorknob menus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good news and bad news&quot; for Sarah Palin. The &quot;bad news is that the IRS says she owes thousands of dollars in back taxes. The good news is that she now qualifies to be in Obama's Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in Arizona today, talking about his plan to help ease the home mortgage crisis. It seemed like a strange place to announce his plan, since most of the homes in Arizona are owned by John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has now addressed two of the three major issues that he said would have to be addressed in order to avert a financial disaster. The first was getting the stimulus package passed. The second was addressing the housing crisis and the third is to get all of us to eat our pets. And I've got a cage full of hamsters that are starting to look absolutely delicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of individual states are having budget problems right now. California in particular is a mess. Governor Schwarzenegger can't get fellow Republicans to vote for his compromise plan because it includes a big tax increase. And he's already done everything he can possibly do to convince them. He told them he'll 'be back,' he said, 'Hasta la vista, baby.' He even threatened to terminate them, several times, to no avail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of a plan to close his state's budget deficit, New York Governor David Paterson is proposing a tax on Internet pornography. You see, this is why we can't have blind governors. I mean, no offense, but of course he's going to tax pornography. If he can't enjoy it, nobody can. What's next, a tax on rainbows?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of state Hillary Clinton was in Japan this week,&quot; where she had &quot;kind of&quot; an &quot;awkward moment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi met with the Pope this week.&quot; After the meeting, Pelosi &quot;asked for the Pope's blessing, and he agreed.&quot; But there was an &quot;embarrassing moment...when the Pope asked her to close her eyes.&quot; Pelosi &quot;said, 'You know, I can't.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Airports all around the country now are switching from metal detectors to those high-tech scanning machines that show a naked image of your body. And this is raising a lot of privacy concerns, especially among women. The good news? Airport security guys now are paying attention 100%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, at 7:00 a.m. this morning, California finally passed a budget. We have a budget in California. The impasse was finally broken when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger threatened to make a sequel to 'Kindergarten Cop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we have a budget, so now we Californians can get back to doing what we do best -- buying homes we can't afford and letting murderers go free.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, owes $70,000 in taxes,&quot; but listen &quot;to this. She's blaming it on Alex Rodriguez's cousin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about the Academy Awards?&quot; There is &quot;a film in the Best Documentary category...about Vice President Dick Cheney and his relationship with the Saudis. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new study that says that in America, rich people are ruder than poor people.&quot; This &quot;is shocking because I didn't know America had any rich people left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the largest Swiss banks is revealing&quot; its &quot;secret client list to the IRS.&quot; Look &quot;at the headline: 'Swiss Bank to Reveal Secrets.'&quot; The story is in &quot;the 'New York Times' so you know it's partially true!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his first trip abroad today. He visited Canada,&quot; and &quot;let me tell you something: If Obama can finally mend our relationship with Canada, well then we'll know this guy really is on to something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Eric Holder, who is our first African-American attorney general, told the Justice Department that when it comes to race, America is a 'nation of cowards.'&quot; You &quot;know, he's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in other news, the new chairman of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, says that he wants to bring a greater Republican presence to the urban setting. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this -- while she was in China,&quot; Hillary Clinton &quot;also managed to get a pirated copy of the movie, 'The Watchmen,' which hasn't even come out yet.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at his trial this week, the Iraqi journalist...who threw his shoes&quot; at former President George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And airports are switching over from metal detectors to those scanning machines that show a naked image of your body. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And investigators have finally located that fugitive billionaire financier guy&quot; that has &quot;been on the lam for about&quot; a week. His &quot;name is Allen Stanford, and they say he cheated over 50,000 people, promising them impossible pie in the sky results from their money that he couldn't possibly deliver on. Or as Washington calls that, 'stimulus package.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about the stimulus package? All right, well, you should be. You're paying for it! You own it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talked to one of my old high school buddies the other day. ... He did something so stupid. Apparently, he bought a house he could afford.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of people are angry over this mortgage bailout. People are upset because they're being told they have to pay the mortgages on someone else's house. They say this is unprecedented, unless, of course, you're a divorced guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was on 'Meet the Press' yesterday. And he said that Barack Obama is more analytical than President Bush. Well, there's a shock, huh? I think Tickle Me Elmo is more analytical than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his trip to Ottawa, Canada, President Obama said he was too embarrassed to admit to the Canadians that he'd never actually seen a hockey game,&quot; to &quot;which the Canadians said, 'Oh, don't worry, we've never seen a black guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the Obamas are expecting the arrival of the first dog in April. ... Actually, it's Obama's second choice of a dog. The first dog, he had some tax problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has announced plans to create their own 24-hour news channel.&quot; They &quot;said it's going to be like a Chinese CNN, basically. In fact, they've already hired Lou Dobbs to complain about illegal Mongolians sneaking over the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Catholic observance of Lent started...last week.&quot; How &quot;many have already given up their 401(k)s?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after giving AIG $85 billion in September and then another $65 billion, what, in November, they're now asking for another $30 billion. The government says they need to restructure the bailout. Restructure? How about rethink or revoke?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the financial columnist Liz Peek, who writes for the 'Wall Street Weekly,' Wall Street is giving President Obama an 'F' for his first month in office.&quot; George W. Bush &quot;was furious when he heard about this. He said, 'Hey, that's easy to do for one month. You try to maintain that 'F' for eight straight years, okay? Then call me. That's when we'll talk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's being reported&quot; that the octomom's &quot;home is in danger of foreclosure. Apparently, the family&quot; is &quot;getting pretty desperate for money. I understand three of her kids&quot; are &quot;already working for Nike.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we got a big snowstorm here in New York City. ... Whew! ... I want to tell you, that Mayor Bloomberg is up to his ears in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news&quot; is that &quot;the foot of snow broke the fall of jumping stockbrokers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had so much snow in the suburbs, you can't see the foreclosure signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a lot of snow in Washington,&quot; so &quot;President Obama's kids stayed home from school and played with Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that President Obama? You know what I'm saying? Let's get some stuff done. And I guess over the weekend he went to a basketball game, went to see the Bulls and the Wizards. And I thought, well, hell, if he'd gone to a Knicks game, he could have played.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;huge blizzard covered the East Coast with 10 inches snow. Police said there would've been traffic jams if people still had jobs to go to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there's two big pieces of news from Iran. ... The first is that the CIA believes that the Iranians will turn on their secret nuclear reactor any day now. And second, the Iranians ? and this is the interesting part -- are demanding an apology from Hollywood. Are these things related? I hope not, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened is that yesterday, the arts and cinema advisor to the Iranian president, whose name is Mockmood Ahma-Dinner-Jacket,&quot; demanded &quot;an apology from Hollywood. ... He says that Hollywood makes movies that are offensive to Iranians.&quot; The story is in &quot;the 'New York Times' so you know there may be some truth to it. Maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; the advisor &quot;pointed out that the movies he didn't like were '300 and 'The Wrestler,'&quot; which he &quot;said...were offensive because they portray Iranians in a negative light.&quot; But &quot;what's offensive about '300?'&quot; In &quot;that movie, the Persians ? the Iranians -- are sexually ambiguous, oiled-up party boys with abs of steel. I'd pay money to be portrayed like that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last year, the Iranian president, Ahma-Dinner-Jacket, said...there were no gays in Iran? Uh-huh. Let me see. There are no gays in Iran but the president has a 'arts and cinema advisor.' Kind of undercuts your case, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, there are no gays in Iran but you watch 'The Wrestler' and '300' back-to-back?&quot; The film &quot;'300' could be the gayest movie ever made. There's gay porn that's less gay than...'300.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Hollywood never apologizes for anything, ever. Like, I've seen dozens&quot; of bad &quot;movies in my life. ... Nobody's apologizing to me, Iran. But then again, I don't have nuclear weapons. Oh, wait, neither do you, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the first episode of 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.' ... I have been getting so much encouragement. In fact, just before I went on, Rush Limbaugh called me up and said he wants me to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced that he plans to bring the troops home from Iraq in 18 months.&quot; But the &quot;troops actually responded and said, 'Thank you, but the economy's better over here, so we're going to stay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about&quot; President Obama's &quot;new budget?&quot; Actually, Obama will &quot;explain it all in his next major address, brought to you by China.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the recession, Microsoft is planning to open stores to compete with Apple. Microsoft says that they'll be just like the Apple stores, except the staff will freeze when you ask them a question.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice to see you all here. ... You're so lucky you live in California,&quot; because there was a &quot;huge snowstorm&quot; in &quot;Washington, DC.&quot; In fact, they are &quot;calling it the city's biggest snow job since that stimulus package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And talk about the age we live in. I saw this today. They unveiled a totally new method of snow removal. Did you hear about this? What they do, is they put AIG in charge of it and the snow just disappears.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIG announced it lost $61.7 billion in the last quarter. What did we give them, $165 billion&quot; in that &quot;bailout thing?&quot; And they still &quot;lost... $61.7 billion, which is the biggest loss by any company in US history.&quot; To put it into perspective, AIG &quot;lost more in December and January than&quot; pro basketball's &quot;LA Clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is offering a pledge of $900 million to the Palestinians in Gaza. Let's hope they don't spend it all on rocks this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, apparently, we ran out of banks in this country to bail out. So now we're bailing out the West Bank as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. This is what they said. The US government guaranteed the $900 million will go directly to the people. All the money will go directly to the people. Why can't we get that deal in this country? Why does it go to the banks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were some optimistic words today from the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke,&quot; who &quot;told Congress the recession might end this year.&quot; Unfortunately, Bernanke &quot;also said&quot; pro football's &quot;Detroit Lions could win the super Bowl and Paris Hilton could get an Oscar. So I don't know. He's a little out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell&quot; you, &quot;the economy is not good. Not good at all. Oh, it's bad.&quot; In &quot;fact, on '24,' Jack Bauer tortured himself for not selling his stock last August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I saw Bill Maher in church praying,&quot; and later, &quot;I saw Warren Buffett buying lottery tickets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal&quot; gave &quot;the Republican response to President Obama's&quot; recent &quot;speech to Congress.&quot; But Jindal did &quot;not get good reviews. I don't know if you saw it. I don't want to say Jindal seemed awkward and off message, but his Secret Service code name is now 'Joe Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mayor Richard Daley said that by the year 2016, there will be a surveillance camera on every street corner in Chicago. Yeah. You know, how about putting a camera on every politician in Chicago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of that,&quot; it is &quot;now being reported that&quot; former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich has &quot;signed a six-figure deal to write a book. See, it took him a while to sign the book deal, because, like everything else in his life, he was waiting for the highest bidder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Blagojevich &quot;said plans to write&quot; a &quot;book exposing the dark and corrupt side of politics. So, apparently, it's an autobiography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news. ... The Obamas are getting a dog. Yes. The Obamas say they're going to go with a Portuguese water dog. ... Doesn't that sound like some kind of lame drink a guy would order to impress a woman? 'Bartender, for the lady, white wine,&quot; and for me, a &quot;'Portuguese water dog.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how much is Rush Limbaugh loving all&quot; his recent &quot;publicity?&quot; He is &quot;everywhere now, since he said he wanted Obama's policies to fail. This is the greatest thing to happen to Limbaugh since they started making that Center Cut Bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger &quot;announced he's going to appear in the new Sylvester Stallone movie. Schwarzenegger wants the world to know he can still act,&quot; but &quot;I think he proved that when he said, 'I won't raise taxes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study by a Harvard Business School professor, when it comes to online pornography, eight of the top ten porn consuming states voted Republican in 2008. Republicans watch more pornography than Democrats. So, apparently, while they were voting for McCain, they were fantasizing about Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Buys 15,000 shares of a company called 'Gogle.' </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in Iraq,&quot; Saddam Hussein's &quot;buddy,&quot; Chemical Ali, has &quot;been sentenced to death for a third time.&quot; He is &quot;so upset that he's fired his lawyers. He got rid of Chemical Jacoby and Chemical Myers. They're gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to thank you for coming out. ... It's nice to be inside. It's brutal out there. The Dow is 30 below zero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is not looking good. ... Everybody's cutting back. I don't know if you heard this,&quot; but today, &quot;the Jonas Brothers fired Nick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. Barack Obama announced he's bringing home troops from Iraq. That's right. Unfortunately, he couldn't get them direct flights home. They have a two-year layover in Afghanistan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama sent a secret letter to Russia's president last month. In it, he promised that the US would back off deploying a missile defense system if Moscow would stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The Russian president immediately fired back a response, saying, 'I don't understand English.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, said she's tired of constantly dating guys who are obsessed with how great her father is. Fortunately for her, she already dated all three of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our new Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,&quot; is &quot;working very hard traveling all over the world. She's been to Korea, Japan, China, Egypt, Israel, or as Bill calls it, 'spring break! Yeah!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it's happened again. President Obama's latest nominee for US trade representative, a man named Ron Kirk,&quot; owes &quot; $10,000 in unpaid back taxes. Apparently, when it comes to taxes, 'yes, we can' is now, 'no, we didn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. One of&quot; Kirk's &quot;tax deductions was $17,000 for tickets to Dallas Mavericks games; $17,000&quot; for pro &quot;basketball tickets.&quot; But &quot;to be fair, since it was the Mavericks, he should be able to write that off as a failed investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Federal Reserve chairman said today that the $700 billion bailout of the banks is not going to be enough money.&quot; When &quot;did the Federal Reserve become like a car mechanic, you know? 'Yeah, we can get the economy running for maybe $700 billion, but there's no guarantee it's not gonna stall out on you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, the government has given AIG $30 billion more. We gave them $165 billion. Now we're giving them $30 billion. You know what AIG stands for? 'And it's gone!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when is it -- I mean we're not even talking millions, we're talking billions -- and when is it enough? Even kids have to do something for their allowance, don't they? ... Can't we get these AIG guys to mow the lawn or take out the garbage? Do something.&quot; Pick &quot;up trash in orange jump suits, maybe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow Jones numbers are so low today they were made an honorary NBC affiliate. That's how bad&quot; the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how bad&quot; the economy is. Listen, &quot;I was in Beverly Hills,&quot; and &quot;I saw a guy driving an American car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't need to tell you folks, but the economy is so bad right now that over 1,000...Americans have volunteered to become the Obama dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President&quot; Obama -- talk &quot;about a tough gig, and talk about optimism. The guy is saying it's a good time to buy stocks. So here's what you do. Instead of that latte you buy in the morning, pick yourself up a thousand shares of GM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a great story. In New Jersey, somebody bought a lottery ticket&quot; and won &quot; $212 million. ... Now, under the new Obama plan, after taxes, that person will have enough money left over to buy another lottery ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's big news. Do you remember Vice President Dick Cheney? Do you remember that guy? And I don't know,&quot; in &quot;the middle of the second term or something, the PR people got together and they said, 'Dick, nobody really knows anything about you.' So he went out and shot his buddy in the face. Do you remember that? Boom! And that was...good for about two years for us here. Well, listen to this.&quot; Cheney has now &quot;been invited to speak at the American Museum of Fly Fishing.&quot; After his &quot;speech, he's going to demonstrate how to waterboard a trout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you say to yourself, 'What are these guys doing in retirement?'&quot; Well, Dick Cheney is &quot;keeping busy.&quot; Today, &quot;as a matter of fact, he hooked up a digital converter box to his pacemaker, so he's ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this because in one little story, we have what's great about this country and what's weird about this country.&quot; A person &quot;in Florida calls 911, you know, the emergency number, 911?&quot; And &quot;here's the emergency -- McDonald's has run out of Chicken McNuggets.&quot; This person &quot;placed a call three times. ... I said, 'Rush Limbaugh, please! Get some help.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, ladies and gentlemen, Rush Limbaugh is the new face of the Republican Party. And I'm thinking, if I see any more of Rush Limbaugh, I'm going to have to send my housekeeper out to buy me painkillers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some uplifting news from Iraq. For the first time, millions of Iraqis have access to the Internet. They can even go on Facebook, as long as the face is wearing a veil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, quite, quite a scare in Washington, DC, today. You may have heard about this. Police were called to the White House. Apparently, President Obama was in a meeting with some potential cabinet nominees. Someone noticed a suspicious looking document on the table no one had ever seen before. Turns out it was just a tax form,&quot; but it &quot;gave them quite a fright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. The President's latest nominee, this one for US trade representative, a man named Ron Kirk, who owes the government $10,000 in back taxes, has agreed to pay his taxes. That's what the paper said today. He's agreed to pay them. When was there a choice?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced he plans to go after tax evaders after failing to pay his own taxes.&quot; It is all part &quot;of the government's 'Operation Do As I Say, Not As I Do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh has challenged President Obama to a debate. A White House spokesman said the President has bigger things to worry about. I'm thinking, 'Really? Bigger than Rush Limbaugh?' Have you...seen Rush lately?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a top Russian scholar, the US economy will collapse next year, which comes as a huge shock to most people. I think we thought it was going to collapse this year,&quot; so &quot;we've got another year to party. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bernard Madoff, the man who operated the Ponzi scream that screwed $50 billion out of people&quot; is &quot;now saying he should be allowed to keep $62 million and his $7 million penthouse. Yeah. His lawyers are arguing he needs that money to live out the rest of his life. You know, I've got a solution for that, okay? It's called the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; the economy&quot; is &quot;in bad shape&quot; in this country, but the &quot;local economy here in Los Angeles is improving, especially if your name is Manny Ramirez. Yeah. Hear about this?&quot; Ramirez signed a two-year, &quot; $45 million&quot; deal with pro baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. And Ramirez &quot;played hardball&quot; for that money. He &quot;told...the Dodgers&quot; that if they did not give &quot;him the money he was asking for, he was going to leave and go over to AIG,&quot; who has &quot;plenty of dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what famous pet passed way? Socks the cat,&quot; who was &quot;19 years old&quot; so I guess it was time. But right up until the end, Bill Clinton was &quot;still blaming the cat for the fresh scratch marks on his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Was it nice outside&quot; today &quot;or not? Yeah! Sunny. I thought it was a very sunny day. I'm driving to work today and I saw a foreclosure sign with an awning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day.&quot; It was so &quot;sunny, as a matter of fact, down on Wall Street, the stockbrokers were applying sunscreen before they jumped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But&quot; do &quot;you know anything about the Dow Jones, ladies and gentlemen?&quot; The &quot;Dow Jones average went down to 6,000. Do you know what that means? Neither do I, but it's the first time in 12 years that the Dow has been the same as Rush Limbaugh's cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know now, Rush Limbaugh is the new face of the Republican Party,&quot; but &quot;they'll probably go with a different body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Rush is fat but he is a red state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh is the new face of the Republican Party,&quot; however. And &quot;he says that he can defeat President Obama in a debate. ... I'm thinking maybe a competitive eating contest, but I don't know about&quot; a debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys know anything about this weasel, this rodent, Bernie Madoff? He &quot;decided what he would do would be to swindle his friends. And so he did a pretty good job. He got them for... $50 billion,&quot; and &quot;now his lovely wife&quot; Ruth &quot;was able to get 69 million. And she wants to keep that.&quot; She and her husband &quot;say it's not fraud money, it's money they saved on gas by fully inflating their tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, big day in Washington, DC, today. Pretty boy Brad Pitt was down there talking to Congress. Brad Pitt, of course, married to the original octomom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And&quot; the current octomom's &quot;boyfriend...says that he's the father&quot; of the octuplets, and he is getting a DNA &quot;test to prove paternity.&quot; But &quot;if I were that guy right now I would be hiding in the mountainous border regions of Afghanistan, for gosh sakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a cute story. You know the Obama kids? They got a swing set there on the White House lawn. And here's the nice thing. This is what you like about Obama.&quot; He is a &quot;very conscientious guy. Thinks of everything,&quot; because the swing set &quot;didn't cost the taxpayers anything. They built the swing set out of old pieces of Dick Cheney's guard tower.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they got a swing set there on the White House lawn and I got to thinking, 'Wow! There really...hasn't been any swinging at the White House&quot; since &quot;that heavyset intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, people are sleeping less because they're worried about the economy. I think also it might have something to do with the fact they're sleeping under bridges.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some exciting news. The Obama family&quot; is &quot;finally getting their dog. ... They say they're getting a Portuguese water dog. And today, Rush Limbaugh said he hopes the dog fails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you see, in a stunning move, Rush Limbaugh has challenged President Obama to a debate. Oh, please. There's no way President Obama could do that. I mean, he'd have to move up, what, at least five weight classes, wouldn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Obama should do. He should debate&quot; Rush Limbaugh &quot;if Rush goes on a 5k run. ... You challenge him to a 5k run. That's the way to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama got some good news today. Listen to this. It seems so many of his cabinet appointees have been forced to pay their back taxes, he now gets a finder's fee from the IRS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN correspondent...Dr. Sanjay Gupta&quot; has &quot;withdrawn his name for consideration to be the next surgeon general of the United States. Yeah, Sanjay Gupta. Doesn't that sound like something Arnold Schwarzenegger would say to me after being on the show? 'San Jay, I had a gupta time on da show!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I want to wish former First Lady Barbara Bush well. She's recovering in the hospital after heart surgery,&quot; while &quot;the rest of us, of course, are trying to recover from her son's Presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called&quot; Mrs. Bush and she is &quot;actually doing quite well. So, that's good. Actually, Bill Clinton called her to say good luck on a speedy recovery. President Obama called to say if there's anything that they could do to help, just ask. And Jason from 'The Bachelor' called to tell Barbara he can't stop thinking about her and he thinks he made a mistake picking Molly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a story I mentioned last night. How scary is this? A previously unknown asteroid narrowly missed hitting the Earth this week. They said that if it hit, it would have been the worst disaster since the invention of the adjustable rate mortgage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was on this day in 1923, the first old-age pensions...in America were created.&quot; These were &quot;based on the idea&quot; that &quot;as you work, you would put a little money into investments so you'd have something to live off of when you retire. How stupid were those people? Imagine falling for that today? Putting your money in the stock market? What idiots!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The National Enquirer,' John Edwards has now admitted to his wife that he did father a love child with his mistress.&quot; But &quot;is it really a love child? I mean, isn't it more like a 'hurry up before my wife gets home' child?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. I mentioned this the other night. Socks, the White House cat -- remember during the Clinton Presidency, remember socks the cat?&quot; Well, Socks has &quot;passed away at the age of 19. Actually, they had to have him put to sleep. But they did it very humanely. What they did was they had Al Gore talk to the cat about global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, not everybody sets their clocks ahead. Were you aware of this? ... On Wall Street, for example, they've already turned back the clocks to 1929.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta&quot; turned &quot;down the surgeon general job, because he'd have to take a pay cut.&quot; Honestly, you &quot;have no idea how much money CNN pays him to keep Larry King alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend&quot; is Daylight Saving Time, &quot;everybody. ... You lose one hour of sleep, but under Obama's tax plan, you lose two, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the economy is &quot;in bad shape.&quot; In fact, &quot;I saw the CEO of Home Depot looking for work in the parking lot of Home Depot. That's how bad&quot; the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in real estate news, the octo-mom just bought a home here in Southern California&quot; for $565,000. How &quot;is she paying for this? She's got 14 kids, no job and no credit. Who financed this deal, AIG?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 66% of Americans think the government should pass laws to fight obesity. Oh, shut up! You know, how about just passing the buffet table, okay? Try that before we get the government involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a sheriff in Illinois is...suing Craigslist, claiming it's the largest source of prostitution in the United States. Apparently there are over 10,000 prostitutes on Craigslist, according to a list compiled by former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you hear about this? Oh, gosh. More problems for the former governor. Another prostitute has come forward to say that she spent time with Governor Spitzer and claimed the governor liked rough sex and would wrap his hands around her neck,&quot; the &quot;same way his wife did when she read this story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you. As the octo-mom said, 'That was more than I was expecting.' By the way,&quot; Rush Limbaugh, &quot;as you know, is the new face of the Republican Party. Have you seen this guy? I mean, he looks like he's carrying octuplets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Warren Buffet says the US economy has fallen off a cliff. I said, 'Well, who cares what that margarita guy thinks anyway?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has lifted the eight-year-old ban on stem cell research. But he was emphatic about one point. He said no cloning. No cloning. Except for Scarlet Johansson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrity birthday today.&quot; Osama bin laden &quot;turned 52 today,&quot; and &quot;apparently he's going through a mid-life crisis&quot; because he bought &quot;himself a bright red 1965 camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd love to give you some good economic news, but here's what I got. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett...said that our current economic crisis is as bad as the attack on Pearl Harbor, but still not as bad as the movie 'Pearl Harbor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is convinced that North Korea&quot; is &quot;testing a new long-range ballistic missile. But North Korea insists that it is just a satellite intended for peaceful purposes, like peacefully bombing South Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's daughter, Meghan, she wrote yesterday that Ann Coulter is 'offensive,' 'radical,' and 'insulting.' Wow. That is by far the nicest thing anyone has ever said about Ann Coulter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week, President Obama took on the teachers union by saying he wants merit pay for teachers and to fire the ones who do not perform well.&quot; That is &quot;pretty bold. A Democrat taking on the unions? That's like Rush Limbaugh going after the donut manufacturers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was a big rally on Wall Street yesterday after Citigroup reported a profit for the first two months of the year. That just goes to show you what determination, hard work, and $45 billion of our bailout dollars can do.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sign&quot; that &quot;the times are a-changin'. The governor of Virginia has signed a new law banning smoking in bars and restaurants. In Virginia. See, that's significant because Virginia is, like, the tobacco state. That would be like the governor of California banning breast implants. 'Yeah, you can't have dee boobs here. No more boobs here if dare not real.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know Osama bin Laden?&quot; Well, he celebrated his 52nd birthday recently. Unfortunately, &quot;people think...he's starting to&quot; lose it. For example, earlier today, he &quot;walked into a cave and said, 'What did I come in here for?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama &quot;said he may negotiate with the Taliban. A lot of people are saying okay, but be careful.&quot; But &quot;I said this guy has experience negotiating with the enemy. For gosh sake, he lives with his mother-in-law, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republican Party says they want a big tent.&quot; They &quot;want to be all-inclusive, they want the big tent, and they're going to make it out of Rush Limbaugh's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama created a new White House Council on Women and Girls,&quot; which &quot;deals with all things related to women. When Bill Clinton heard about it, he said, 'Why didn't I think of that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama today said he believes American children should go to school longer, either staying later in the day every day or longer into the summer if we want to stay competitive with other countries. The President said we can't stick with a school calendar that was created during a time when most Americans were farmers. And he's right. We need a new school calendar for a time when most Americans are unemployed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see, it is 11:35. Right about now, Bernie Madoff hearing the two scariest words of his life. 'Lights out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Bernard Madoff pled guilty today in court for running a Ponzi scheme, was immediately taken to jail. Get this, when he was taken to jail, he wasn't wearing a wedding ring. So, you know what that means, guys. In prison, he's available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said we have let our schools crumble and other nations are outpacing us in learning. But the good news, we're still number one in the number of students sleeping with their teachers. So, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another big bailout yesterday. Levi Johnson bailed out of his engagement to Sarah Palin's daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now officially confirmed that Bristol Palin has broken off her engagement to Levi Johnson, the father of her baby. Yeah. See, their relationship never evolved because they don't believe in evolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Assemblyman Felix Ortiz -- this guy's from the Bronx. He has introduced legislation -- listen to this -- proposing a $10 tax on strip club customers. There'd be a $10 tax. Yeah. So, we've gone from a stimulus package tax increase to a tax increase to get our package stimulated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea of how bad the economy is. Rush Limbaugh down to just three meals a day. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's first speech on the lecture circuit is June 17th in Pennsylvania. President Bush will discuss his eight years in office and the challenges facing us in the 21st century. Of course, the biggest challenge, getting over his eight years in office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidential candidate John Edwards spoke to Brown University last night to a crowd of 600 people. I think the topic was 'From Hair to Paternity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He spoke to the students at brown about poverty and morals. Yeah, and who better to lecture young people about poverty and morals than a rich personal injury attorney who knocked up his mistress?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security plans to study the possibility that the human body -- that human body odor could be used to tell whether people are lying or not. You can smell someone and tell by their odor whether they're lying. You thought you hated your job. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got kind of a moral dilemma here. Do you think, and be honest about this, do you think it's too soon for me to hit on Bernie Madoff's wife?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernie and his wife Ruth want to keep $69 million dollars. They said that's not money they swindled. That's just money they had laying around. That's money they saved by switching to Geico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are now saying that the recession we're in turning perhaps to a depression is not as bad as the one they went through in 1929. So what we're going through now, not as bad as 1929. And I said hey, come on, give us a chance. We can make it worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York state is considering a tax every time you go into a strip club. A $10 tax every time you go into a strip club. For example, in my case, it would be, well, like what's 365 times 10, what would that be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristol Palin and Levi Johnson &quot;have broken up. That's right. That's right. And apparently it was not that big a surprise. Even the Russians saw it coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think secretly, Rush Limbaugh wanted them to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But right about now, Sarah Palin is in a helicopter hunting for the boyfriend with her rifle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernie Madoff pleaded guilty to all charges and is now in jail. That's it. It's been a really busy day for him. He got an orange jumpsuit. He met his new cell mate. And he's converted to Islam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's teenage daughter, Bristol, she broke up with her fiance, Levi Johnston. Yeah. But today they announced they're recording a duet together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The journalist who threw his shoes at George Bush was convicted on Thursday in an Iraqi court. He was sentenced to three years of non-stop high-fives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Motors says they won't need the $2 billion bailout money after all. Apparently they're getting great returns with some guy named Madoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judge sent Madoff straight to jail. He said do not pass go, do not collect $200. Although Madoff said I could turn that $200 into $400.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may have to put him in a cell that separates him from the general population because this guy is really hated. He's like Osama bin Laden, OJ Simpson and Rush Limbaugh rolled into one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madoff's victims thought they were making nice, safe investments. Now I'm certainly not blaming them, but maybe they should've been tipped off by the guy's name. 'Made-off.' That's like giving your money to a guy called 'Steve Criminal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Kazakhstan has proposed that we take the idea of the euro one step further. He wants to have a single currency for the whole world.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden turned 52 years old yesterday. You can tell Osama was getting older. Like today, he declared a jihad on erectile dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ironically, you know what happened? She could see him with another girl from her front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Bristol is now a single mother, as the press calls her the Uno-mom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forbes magazine reported that Warren Buffett lost $25 billion last year. ... That's a lot of money. The guy's 78 years old. Now he's only worth $37 billion. You know, I was thinking -- let's say he lives to be 100. That gives him gee, only $4.5 million a day to live on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China expressed concern about the billion of dollars in loans they've made to the US government in Treasuries. ...

Four words: Lil Wayne for Senator. 3. Bring back this guy (George W. Bush dancing with African dancers). 2 How 'bout stealing and ordering hits like when Nixon ran things. 1.

You know the main thing they want to reward their people for? Convincing the Treasury Department to give out $170 billion to a failing company so they can give out bonuses for a job well done.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know what AIG stands for? Anybody know? Adventures In Greed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the best part. They don't have to account for any of this. Now it turns out they gave $35 billion -- not million -- $35 billion of our money to bail out European banks. See, this is how a global economy works. Our hard earned tax dollars are used to bail out German banks for making bad investments in American companies that shut down because their Japanese owners moved the whole thing to India, China and Mexico. You follow?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you thought St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland. Let's send him down to Wall Street. That's what we should do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was called before Congress again. Geithner defended himself against criticism, saying he inherited this crisis. In fact, he said when the economy started this downturn he was busy in the private sector cheating on his taxes. He didn't have time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. Bristol Palin,&quot; Sarah &quot;Palin's daughter, has broken up with babydaddy Levi Johnston. I was stunned when I heard. I mean, really, if two kids without a decent education and no jobs and a baby can't make it, what hope is there for the rest of us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Levi told a friend, 'I should have spent more time picking a mate,'&quot; which is &quot;the same thing&quot; John McCain &quot;said about Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Justice department said they will no longer use the term 'enemy combatant' when talking about detainees at Guantanamo Bay. ... The new name will be 'guys who make you nervous when they're on your flight.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a guy that won't go away, that Osama bin Laden. ... We got another audiotape from...bin Laden. Have you heard it? He attacks...moderate Arab leaders, he calls for renewed jihad, and he gives his NCAA picks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then on the tape,&quot; Osama bin Laden &quot;wonders out loud why Jennifer Anniston can't hold on to a guy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But bin Laden's new audiotape is such a hit&quot; that today, &quot;Al Jazeera offered him the 10:00 p.m. time slot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember a woman by the name of Sarah Palin? She is the governor of Alaska&quot; and she ran for vice president. Well, &quot;you remember that...one of her&quot; daughters, &quot;a very young girl,&quot; was &quot;pregnant and was going to get married to the young man that knocked her up.&quot; And the young man &quot;was saying that, 'You know, we're just not ready for marriage.' And I thought, well, that makes sense because their mother really wasn't ready to be vice president either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's past midnight. So it's officially St. Patrick's Day, everybody!&quot; But here &quot;in New York, it's tough. It's tough, with the economy struggling.&quot; In fact, the &quot;drinks are so expensive, no one can afford to throw up anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody. ... Of course, St. Patrick's day&quot; is &quot;a little different this year. Nobody's got any green left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; a &quot;little quiz&quot; for you. What is &quot;the difference between an AIG executive and a drunken Irishman? A drunken Irishman spends his own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech yesterday, President Barack Obama lashed out about these excessive bonuses. He said the trouble at AIG was caused by recklessness and excessive greed.&quot; But &quot;here's the problem.&quot; The &quot;AIG executives thought it was a compliment. They went, 'Oh, thanks, wow.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Obama's so upset that he changed his slogan from, 'Yes we can' to 'oh no you don't!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republicans are on board in this, too. Iowa Senator Charles Grassley told AIG executives -- this is what he actually said -- he said they should either quit or commit suicide.&quot; But &quot;I think that's plain wrong. I mean, why give them the option of quitting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like&quot; Grassley's &quot;idea, but here's my question: where was Congress when everything was falling apart, you know? They're supposed to be looking out for us. Here's a better idea. How about AIG and Congress making a giant suicide pact?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this story. You know Bernard Madoff?&quot; Well, lawyers &quot;now say they plan to argue that...his wife, Ruth, is entitled to keep as much as $69 million in assets. Yeah, please. Even AIG guys are going 'Shut up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big story for us&quot; is that President Barack Obama is &quot;coming to the show Thursday night. Very excited about that,&quot; but it &quot;might be kind of awkward for our second guest that night, Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite story of the week. I just love this story. Police in Illinois claim that Gary Skoien, who is the former chairman of the Cook County Republican Party,&quot; was &quot;in his children's play room at 1:00 a.m. in the morning with two hookers, when his wife walks in, catches him and the wife beats him up with a toy guitar. And she's like a superstar. In fact, women in the neighborhood now call her Guitar Hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New research out of the University of Virginia says that our mental abilities begin to decline around the age of 27. ... In fact, by the age of 50, many of us are thinking at a President Bush level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you, a beautiful day in New York City. Am I right about that? ... It was so nice today that AIG gave a bonus to Al Roker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this AIG? You folks know what I'm talking about? They've...received federal bailout money now three times from the government. And now, after going broke, they're giving bonuses to executives, the same people who wrecked the company. They're getting bonuses for doing a horrible job. Well, hell, I ought to get one of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you were laughing, AIG just handed out another $100 million in bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, a little health scare for former Vice President Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne Cheney. She was hospitalized briefly after fainting at home. She's apparently okay. But here's kind of a funny thing that happened. The paramedics arrived, and out of habit they started giving CPR to Dick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is even affecting March Madness this year. The winning team is now required to replace the net after they cut it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In honor of St. Patrick's Day,&quot; the &quot;water in the fountains at the White House today was dyed green, which might be the only green a lot of Americans see this year so enjoy it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, the President was gifted with a bowl of shamrocks from the Irish prime minister.&quot; It is &quot;a tradition, I guess. They do it every year, but what they don't do every year -- and I thought this was a clever idea -- is transplant those shamrocks into the Vice President's forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a big St. Patty's Day party at the White House tonight with corned beef and cabbage, green beer -- the whole thing. It's an important part of Obama's everybody get drunk and forget about the economy policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone had a nice&quot; time, but &quot;I guess things got ugly for a second when Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, mistook Dennis Kucinich for a leprechaun and tried to choke him for his gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all have a nice St. Patrick's Day yesterday? I tell you, it is a huge holiday here in Los Angeles. To give you an idea how big it is, the Promises Rehab Center in Malibu...had a happy hour&quot; yesterday. That is &quot;how big it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, Usain Bolt, you know the gold medal-winning sprinter, ran his first race of the season. He tied for first place in the 100-meter dash.&quot; The &quot;guy he tied with&quot; was an &quot;AIG executive running to the bank to cash his check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;very upset with AIG. He said the problems at AIG were caused by greed, to which AIG said, 'Well, what do you think the 'G' stands for? Hello!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIG, which already received $170 billion in taxpayers' money, paid $165 million in bonuses.&quot; But &quot;they say the bonuses are justified because the company made an extra $170 billion last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of AIG told Congress this afternoon that he asked AIG employees to give back half their bonuses.&quot; Well, I guess they did a half-a*#ed job,&quot; so &quot;I guess that...kind of makes sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday,&quot; New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo &quot;reported that 73 AIG executives were mailed bonus checks of a million dollars or more and 11 of those people don't even work for the company anymore. Imagine that, executives getting bonus checks for a company that lost billions. AIG? Sounds more like NBC, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said that AIG executives should follow the Japanese model by publicly apologizing and then doing one of two things -- either resign or kill themselves.&quot; But why &quot;not have them resign, then kill themselves on pay per view, huh? That would raise enough money to pay off everybody they screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government said they would like to prevent AIG from using taxpayer money to pay themselves these huge bonuses, but there's very little they can do legally. Well, duh, take a page from the Bush/Cheney book&quot; and &quot;do it illegally. Hey, we all watch '24.' You know how it works. Have Jack Bauer shoot them in the knee. Come on!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the exciting news, President Barack Obama will be on our show tomorrow night. ... Of course, NBC jumping on every opportunity. They say if the President does well, it could lead to his own series, '30 Barack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reese Witherspoon&quot; is &quot;on the show tonight. She has a new movie, 'Monsters vs. Aliens.' Now, don't confuse it with a show on CNN. That's 'Lou Dobbs vs. Aliens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;March Madness. Are you excited about college basketball?&quot; The NCAA tournament starts out at 65, &quot;then it goes right to 64, then 32, then 16, then four, then down to just one. I mean, it's like GM stock, really, when you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember Poppin' Fresh? He's that pasty...white guy.&quot; He &quot;was certainly doughy, fat, overweight, pasty, white, doughy guy. He had a radio show with a weird political ? I'm sorry. I'm confused. That's Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush is writing a book. No, that's not the joke. It's a serious book about the 12 toughest decisions he made as President. It's called 'The Ten Toughest Decisions I Made As President.' It's...a good book. It's a pop-up book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-il has demanded that North Korea open its first pizzeria.&quot; It will have pizza just like the kind &quot;we have over here,&quot; but their &quot;Crazy Bread&quot; will &quot;actually&quot; be crazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to go to Papa Jong's,&quot; the new North Korean pizzeria. It is &quot;going to be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The delivery policy&quot; at the North Korean pizzeria &quot;is a little different.&quot; If the pizza is &quot;not there in 30 minutes or less, the driver gets executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In...worthless drain on taxpayer money news, insurance giant AIG is on the hot seat because after they took billions of dollars in bailout money,&quot; they &quot;gave $165 million out in bonuses to their executives.&quot; So now, &quot;lawmakers are demanding that they give the money back. The problem, though, is that legally they're entitled to the money so it's a dilemma. But I have an idea I think might satisfy all of us and also adhere to the letter of the law. ... I say, instead of mailing the bonus checks to their houses, we put rocks on them and we put them at the bottom of an enormous piranha tank. We set it up in the middle of Times Square. You want the money, swim. There it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very excited to have the President of the United States, Barack Obama here. A lot of people...were surprised that the President came to NBC. You'd think by this time he'd be tired of big companies on the brink of disaster with a bunch of overpaid executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing, though,&quot; is that &quot;even though the President travels with this huge group of people -- I mean, he's got the staff, Secret Service, presidential aides ? it's still less people than when we have Mariah Carey on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we were also going to have Vice President Joe Biden come out and say a few words, but, you know, it's only an hour show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, people think it's amazing that the President would take the time to leave Washington, DC, and fly 3,000 miles to come to California. But...that happens to a lot of guys when their mother-in-law moves in with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it would be cool to be president. You know what I would do if I was president? I would watch the movie 'Air Force One' on Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, the President held a town meeting, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was there. And I thought it was great to see the President reaching out to California's non English-speaking community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama standing next to Governor Schwarzenegger? Didn't the President look like the head of a company who's introducing its latest cyborg model to the world?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Washington Post' reporting that senior executives at AIG whose decisions caused the companies to collapse...are long gone and that these bonuses that everybody's complaining about are actually being paid to people who are trying to fix the problem. Okay, here's my thing. Fix the problem, then you get the bonus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this. AIG...says they're trying to raise more money by selling their big office building in New York. It's 66 stories!&quot; And &quot;not one of them is the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you,&quot; the economy is &quot;in bad shape. ... The economy is so bad, President Obama flew out here on Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In international news, the president of Madagascar left office after a popular radio host there rallied support against him and will likely take over in a special election. And today, Rush Limbaugh said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pittsburgh Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney has been named ambassador to Ireland by President Obama. ... Well, I guess the President said, 'Rooney had all the credentials ? he's Irish and he paid his taxes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to question the President,&quot; but is Rooney &quot;the best choice? I mean, the Steelers...have a busy year ahead of them, don't they, right? They're Super Bowl champs, right? They're probably going to be in the playoffs again. Shouldn't the President pick somebody with nothing to do, like the owner of the Detroit Lions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night for the network tonight. Barack Obama became the first sitting president to ever appear on a late night show. He was on 'Leno' tonight. Of course, it doesn't count the time Thomas Jefferson was on 'Larry King.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush just signed a $7 million book deal, though, reportedly, he thought it was to read one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard this today, a new audiotape from Osama bin Laden was released.&quot; On the tape, &quot;he says he doesn't care what anyone says, he's not giving back his bonus money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new comic book about Michelle Obama's life will be released this April. In the comic book, the First Lady battles her archenemy, sleeves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People made a big deal out of the fact that this is the first time a sitting president has done a late night show. But we tried to have other presidents on. But, you know, President Bush, he went to bed every night at 9:00,&quot; and &quot;President Clinton always seemed to have other late night plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Garth Brooks was on last night. ... You know, we were supposed to have Willie Nelson here, too, but he had to drop out because of tax problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, right after we finished taping last night, President Obama had to leave quickly and fly back to Washington so he could yell at Chris Dodd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this? Senator...Chris Dodge, as they're calling him now, after first denying it, now admits he's the one who eliminated the provision in the stimulus package that outlawed excessive bonuses. And coincidentally, he just happened to receive $280,000 from AIG in campaign contributions. What are the odds of that? Man, that's like putting Chris Brown in charge of the...battered women's shelter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh and here's my favorite thing. You know, we own AIG, right? We own 80% of it. And because of all of the outrage over the bonuses, armed guards now have to be placed outside the AIG offices. You know what that means? Not only are we paying the AIG executive bonuses, we are now paying to protect the executives from us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and now they're talking about selling their office building in Manhattan to raise money. Oh, yeah, selling that office building. Yeah, this is a great time to get involved in real estate. They'll lose another billion dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a better idea. Put all the employees inside, put bars on a window, call it a jail and just lock the place up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this? You see this on the news? Two drug-smuggling suspects were being pursued by police on the freeway...in San Diego. They were throwing money out the window. Just throwing cash, like $17,000 in cash, out the window. At first people thought it was, you know, President Obama's stimulus package. They didn't realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, economists say this new stimulus bill will eventually allow companies who laid off people to hire them back. So the company that coldly told you that your service is no longer needed, they can end up rehiring you. And believe me; I can personally testify that this actually does happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former&quot; President George W. Bush &quot;now says he's going to write a book about the 12 toughest decisions that he's made in office. The book will be called '0 For 12.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama sent a videotaped message to the people of Iran...marking the celebration of the Iranian new year. And here's the really weird part -- it was co-hosted by Dick Clark and Ryan Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama's appearance on 'The Tonight Show' got huge ratings. So to promote his upcoming book,&quot; former President George W. Bush &quot;will appear on 'The Biggest Loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is very busy these days. He was just invited to his 30-year high school reunion in Hawaii. I heard they tracked him down on Facebook.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Consumer Product Safety Commission is warning that many children's books from the '80s have dangerous amounts of lead in them. In fact, they just found Waldo. He's on a respirator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, the First Lady, Michelle Obama, celebrated spring by breaking ground on a new vegetable garden at the White House. She said she did it to help educate children about healthy, locally grown food and to help her own family survive the coming economic apocalypse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, a good day on Wall Street. Stock market went up 500 points today. Very exciting. ... Went up so high, even CNBC's Jim Cramer made money. Wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, apparently what happened was stockbrokers were so distracted by the NCAA tournament, they weren't able to screw things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's pretty good, 500...points in one day. So, looks like President Obama took the economic advice I gave him when he was here the other night. You remember&quot; when &quot;I whispered in his ear during the break?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Barack Obama was on the show Thursday, I got a phone call from Joe Biden going, 'Wow, what was it like to talk to the President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration&quot; today unveiled their &quot;plan to deal with the so-called toxic assets. Those are those mortgage-backed securities...all the financial institutions are holding. Apparently, the plan is to flood the banks with money, make them as liquid as possible,&quot; and &quot;then sort of soak up all these bad loans and take them away. See, they got this idea from watching those ShamWow commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see Barack Obama on '60 Minutes' last night?&quot; You &quot;could tell the President was getting a little annoyed. Every time Obama mentioned the Great Depression, the...anchors would go, 'The depression, I'll tell you what it was like during the depression! We ate dirt sandwiches! We had nothing!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for AIG. It turns out the bonus money that AIG got was actually $218 million and not the $165 million that was originally reported. AIG said they misplaced $53 million in bonuses. And today, Senator Chris Dodd said, 'You mean that wasn't a campaign contribution?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congress is now investigating the special treatment that 'Senator Dodge,' as we're calling him now, received from Countrywide Mortgage for a couple of mortgages. Senator Dodd has contended he didn't know he was getting special rates on the mortgages. ... And, really, to be fair, how would the Senate chairman of the banking committee have any idea what the normal lending rate would be? He would have no idea!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama has filled out his NCAA tournament bracket. He picked 14 of the Sweet 16 right. ... That's pretty good. That's better than he did with his cabinet positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and&quot; former President George W. Bush &quot;is now writing a book about the 12 toughest decisions that he had to make as president. He said each decision had three options -- rock, paper and scissors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this week eight tourists became the first Westerners to vacation in Iraq on an officially sanctioned tour. They're taking spring break in Iraq, which is kind &quot;of like spring break in Florida. ... Half get bombed. The other half get stoned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a move that will cost 300 Americans their jobs, the Federal government announced it will no longer buy American-made condoms made in Alabama. ... We're now going to buy cheaper condoms made in China. Does that make any sense? If Chinese condoms are so good, why are there over one billion Chinese people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day in New York City today.&quot; In fact, it was so nice, &quot;the AIG executives were counting their bonuses in the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you something, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe you noticed this already. If I seem in a bad mood tonight it's because CBS just declared me a toxic asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration&quot; wants &quot;to unload a trillion dollars in toxic assets. I don't know what that means,&quot; but &quot;do you know how much a trillion dollars is? A trillion dollars&quot; is &quot;almost as much as the AIG bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie 'Knowing'&quot; won &quot;the weekend box office with $24.8 million. Or as it's called at AIG, 'a junior executive bonus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you see this on '60 Minutes' last night? Michelle Obama's planting a vegetable garden on the White House lawn. ... You know the economy is bad when the Obamas are afraid of running out of food.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama filled...three of the remaining top jobs at the Treasury Department. Their job&quot; will be &quot;to collect taxes from all the other cabinet members that haven't paid them yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey,&quot; you &quot;hear about this? Very...strange incident at JFK Airport in New York City today. An AIG executive going through security had to empty out all his pockets. You know what fell out? Senator Chris Dodd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on '60 Minutes' the other night, if you saw the interview, reporter Steve Croft asked President Obama how he could laugh with all the financial trouble going on. And the President said it's necessary to have a measure of 'gallows humor to get you through the day.' You know why Obama likes gallows humor? It works much better for him than bowling humor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the market rallied yesterday after the Treasury said it was going to help banks sell off their toxic assets. That's the big problem, banks can't sell toxic assets. Well, duh. I mean, I'm no economist, but maybe you should stop calling them toxic assets. Huh? Isn't that like KFC advertising salmonella chicken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of China is going to be doing a Broadway style play based on Karl Marx's book on communism. A play based on communism. You know, that's where capitalism has been replaced by the government taking over control of all private industries. Or as we call in this country, 'a stimulus package.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has now committed $700 million to help beef up US security at the Mexican border. I think most people&quot; are &quot;pretty surprised by this. 'What? We have security at the Mexican border? When did that start?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Japan for winning the World Baseball Classic right here in Dodger Stadium. Yeah, they beat...Korea 5-3, which is perfect. You have the Japanese playing the Koreans in a city full of Mexicans to determine who's best at America's pastime. ... I think Lou Dobbs' head is going to explode when he hears this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama&quot; is &quot;going to put a garden in the White House out there where the Rose Garden is. Yes. A very nice idea. And she's out there digging it up, and she found three of Dick Cheney's hunting buddies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama held a big press conference earlier tonight. ... He's on TV a lot these days. The only way Obama could get more TV time is if he had eight babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's not forget the AIG company. The AIG stands for 'ain't I greedy?' No, they changed&quot; the &quot;name of the company today&quot; to &quot;AIU. Oh! Okay then. Everything's forgiven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIU for 'ain't I unethical?' There you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shouldn't they change their name to something that will throw people off because they love it? Like, they could change their name to Puppies and Moonbeams Inc. or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIG changing their name&quot; is &quot;like Hitler changing his name and hoping people won't notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Obama held his second primetime press conference. He spent the first half defending the economy, and the second half defending the decision to interrupt 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;answered questions about how the economy's progressing. And in a nutshell, it's not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Iowa are already receiving phone calls about whether or not they approve of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. They're instructed to press one for 'yes' and two for 'you betcha!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's government just offered a $2 million bounty on its top drug lords, which is different from what we do here in America. We give our biggest criminals bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight,&quot; President Barack Obama &quot;held a news conference on all the channels in primetime to talk about the economy. Apparently he's unaware that we're trying to pick an 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama also repeated his support for Treasury Secretary Geithner, who unveiled his plan yesterday for the government to buy up the so-called 'toxic assets' from troubled banks and sell them to China, which will then make them into children's toys&quot; and that &quot;should solve the problem entirely.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama went on primetime TV&quot; last night and &quot;urged the nation to be patient. He said 'American Idol' will be back tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were mad that the President preempted 'American Idol.' ... I mean, halfway into the news conference, fans called in and tried to vote him off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched the President's news conference last night? ... He got a little testy there, you know. When he was asked why he waited three days to speak out against the AIG bonuses, President Obama said he likes to know what he's talking about before he speaks. So, yet another reversal of the Bush policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also announced a major faith-based program. His budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Obama also unveiled his new border policy to fight the Mexican drug wars. Interesting. It consists of the feds buying up to 80% of all the Mexican cartels. You see, we're going to get all the toxic drugs out of the system. We're going to buy them up. We will be owners of the drug cartels. I'm trying to get something with that joke and it's going nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia becoming even more fundamentalist. Clerics now in Saudi Arabia said they want women banned from appearing on television. They don't want women appearing, so apparently they get 'The View' over there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the rumor is there's a film being made about the Monica Lewinsky affair called 'Special Relationship.' ... The part of Hillary will be played by the beautiful actress Julianne Moore. The part of Monica will be played by Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You Work For A Bad Company: &quot;10. Workday begins with a pledge of loyalty to Kim Jong Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You Work For A Bad Company: &quot;4. Blew $40 billion in government bailout funds on a state-of-the-art taco bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs You Work For A Bad Company: &quot;1. Company gave George W. Bush $7 million for his memoirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. George W. Bush,&quot; who &quot;was our president before Barack Obama, recently &quot;signed...a deal to write a book&quot; for &quot; $7 million.&quot; And &quot;it makes sense because when you think George W. Bush, you think book. Don't you, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the book, George W. Bush will discuss his 12 toughest&quot; decisions, &quot;like 'should I heed Al Roker's warnings about Katrina?' That would be one tough decision. 'Should I let Cheney carry a loaded shotgun?' That would be&quot; another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now...here's evidence of actual progress in Iraq. Iraq, as of today, is officially open to tourism. ... Cut me a slice of that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it's tourism season in Iraq because today an American had to duck a pair of flip-flops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I was thinking about this. If you want to take a trip, a vacation, to some place where they've got sniper fire, dangerous streets, a lot of goat-based food, and random violence, just &quot;come to New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HBO&quot; is &quot;making a movie about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid are the actors. They're great actors, so you know they'll be believable in the roles, especially Dennis Quaid as Hillary. That will be awesome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama held his second primetime press conference&quot; last night. ... He said we're seeing definite signs of progress and that a better day will come. And then he stopped and said, 'Sorry, we're talking about the Knicks, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people are complaining, though, that Obama is becoming too scripted. Last night, he was having an intimate moment with Michelle, and she said, 'Wait, are you reading the teleprompter?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Nickelodeon's asking all children to unplug electronic devices for one minute on Earth Day to teach the importance of respecting the environment. ... I think it's a great idea, unless the kids are visiting their grandmother in a nursing home. Then...that one minute is pretty rough. 'SpongeBob killed Nana. What happened?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Saudi Arabia, radical clerics want to ban all women from appearing on television. This is really bad news for fans of the hit comedy, 'How I Met Your Mullah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the first day of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's two-day trip&quot; to Mexico. She &quot;spent today with President Felipe Calder?n, discussing the drug violence that's been spilling over from Mexico into the United States. And then she flew to Cancun to look for Bill. He's been missing. Spring break. What are gonna do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
