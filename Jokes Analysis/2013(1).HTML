<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all remember Al Gore. Vice President of the United States for eight years and was President of the United States for about 36 hours. ? And then they pulled the old switcheroo on him. Then, he and some old buddies started yacking about global warming and he?and another guy bought a TV network called Current TV. ? Now Al Jazeera, the Arab language television news network?has purchased Al Gore's old TV network, Current TV. So, it's now owned by Al Jazeera. And listen to this: $500 million. $500 million. This is a little something Al Gore has come up with called global fleecing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well the 113th edition of the United States Congress arrived on Capitol Hill today and on Monday pitchers and catchers report. What?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Boehner this afternoon was reelected Speaker of the House. And I thought sure, he's done such a great job. You know who's angry at John Boehner, is Governor Chris Christie from New Jersey. He's furious because he can't get the Hurricane Sandy storm relief money and?people who knew him say he has not been this angry since Olive Garden cut off his bread sticks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, members of the 113th Congress were sworn in at the Capitol. After which, they were like, 'Well, that's enough work for the year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Senate swore in a record 20 female senators. Good. Yeah. The women said that they're very excited and look forward to proving that they can accomplish just as little as male senators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Boehner re-elected Speaker of the House, which is pretty amazing. A Republican winning anything these days - that's amazing that he would get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about?my man, Chris Christie. He is mad. He is pissed off. You see him lay into John Boehner and the House Republicans for dragging their feet on that Hurricane Sandy relief bill? Oh my, God. See, I'm not surprised. Christie is from the Jersey Shore. He knows how to deal with people that have spray-on tans. He knows how to deal with those kinds of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christie also lashed out at Congress for doing nothing for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. But in their defense, Congress says, 'Hey, we don't do anything for anybody.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama signed the new fiscal cliff tax increase into law while vacationing in Hawaii today. He used this thing called an autopen. You know what that is? It's an electronic way of signing your name when you're not even there. Isn't that great? We live in an age where politicians can now raise your taxes while they're on vacation in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of his help in getting the fiscal cliff bill passed, the 'National Journal' says that Joe Biden may be the most influential Vice President in history. Joe Biden got this exciting news while he was walking President Obama's dog, Bo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, do you believe the cold weather all across the country? It is freezing. ? It was so cold in Washington, John Boehner was happy to have Chris Christie breathing down his neck.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on this week. Congress approved some version of the fiscal tax bill, which raises taxes on the rich Americans. President Obama was determined to do this right away. You know, while there are still some rich Americans left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well you know, Americans from all sides of the political spectrum seem to be upset about this fiscal cliff deal. Well, imagine how the Chinese must feel. Huh? I mean, it's their money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, members of Congress are set to get a pay raise this year. Unbelievable. Isn't it like tipping the plumber for fixing the toilet he blocked up in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illinois Senator Mark Kirk, who bravely returned to the Senate yesterday after a major stroke. Guy had a major stroke, and he came back. Yeah, it was great. But he said, while he was in the hospital, he had a near death experience. He said he saw three angels at the foot of his hospital bed. Boy, that Obamacare is unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a California company is now working to get marijuana vending machines approved in Colorado and Washington State. Well, they figure it would be a gold mine. You know what would be the real gold mine? Owning the candy machine next to the marijuana vending machine. That would be the gold mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fascinating story, Al Gore, Vice President, and President for a minute, was it-- owned Current TV. It was a network that nobody ever watched on purpose. Now Al Gore has sold his network, Current TV, to Al Jazeera. Al Gore, Al-Jazeera, Al Gore. Thank God we can now get weather for the Persian Gulf. So that will be invaluable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Mitt Romney's son, Tagg - Tagg claims now that Mitt, his father, had never-- had absolutely no interest in running or being President. Had absolutely no interest in being President. It sort of rings true if you hear it from your son, Tagg. And I'm no behavioralist, but I'm thinking if you don't want to be President, well, then what you ought to do is get out there and run twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company is trying to bring marijuana vending machines to Colorado and Washington State. They say it will make millions, and that's just from the one guy who keeps forgetting he already put a dollar in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that hundreds of people have signed a petition asking the White House to create a TV show that would follow Joe Biden around in his daily life. Even Honey Boo Boo was like, 'Dude, that would be hilarious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is a shocking statistic: It seems the jobless rate for people between the ages of 18-to-29 has hit a staggering 11.5%. Which means, parents, not only were your grown kids home for the holidays - they are home for good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little bit of history for you. The first US presidential election was held on this very day in 1789. And everything went smoothly. You know why? Florida didn't become part of the union until 1890.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Democrats said they want another trillion dollars in taxes. Trillion dollars. What? Didn't we just give them $620 billion last Wednesday? Is that gone already? I mean, who is running this, 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, the government is going to now mint - forgive me I just don't understand any of this - is going to mint a single coin, valued at $1 trillion. Honestly, if you can explain that to me you can have the damn show. It's all yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chuck Hagel is the new Secretary of Defense and I'm telling you Washington makes me crazy. They are already saying that this guy may be reluctant to send troops into a war zone needlessly. What kind of a nut job is this guy? What - are you kidding me? We have a new CIA Director whose name is John Brennan. This guy is already - well, you had John Brennan in the pool. Good for you. I'm telling you - don't kid yourself, that's not an easy gig, being Director of the CIA. The job begins the second they swear you in; first thing this morning they briefed this guy on the Kardashian pregnancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tickets to President Obama's inauguration have sold out. At least that's what the President is telling Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear Joe Biden and his wife left DC this weekend for a five-day vacation in the Caribbean. Of course, most of that time will be spent telling him that Margaritaville isn't a real place. 'It's not? All right, well, let's go to Funky Town then. We'll take Electric Avenue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, the White House announced that AT&amp;T will sponsor President Obama's second inauguration. It's gonna be great. It's like ? 'My fellow Americans. You're breaking up. Are you in a tunnel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We begin where we left off: Dangling tenuously on the precipice of the fiscal cliff. ? Let's get caught up on what this fiscal cliff is again. ? The fiscal cliff is the economic catastrophe that would occur with the simultaneous expiring of the Bush tax cuts and deep across-the-board spending cuts that Congress scheduled to kick in January 1st if Congress couldn't negotiate a fiscal solution by January 1st. Confused? Let me put it in terms of a 21st Century analogy that can crystallize the point of it. Pretend America is a successful railroad company that has fallen on some hard fiscal times. There's an argument within the company about whether to make some changes to the dining car offering, maybe cut fares for less wealthy riders, or, on the other side of the argument, where trains themselves are steel beasts that Stalin invented to kill freedom and Martha Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, before I went on break, all the news was about a looming economic cataclysm known as the fiscal cliff. I didn't watch any news over the break but I assume we did not plunge over this cliff because I have not spent the last week fighting seagulls for discarded hot dog buns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new CIA Director. John Brennan could be our new CIA Director. And you know when you are named CIA Director, bang, zoom, it starts immediately. They had him up all night last night briefing him on the Hugh Hefner honeymoon, so he's ready to go. And then they're going to get into the Kim Kardashian pregnancy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes a genius and dumb guys intersect. You know what I mean? I mean, usually you have genius going this way and you have dumb guys going this way, but every now and then they actually - I tell you what I'm talking about, you know we're hopelessly in debt. There's $20 trillion. Start counting now and call me around Labor Day and let me know how high - how close to $20 trillion you've gotten. We're $20 trillion in debt, so somebody at the Treasury Department says, 'You know what let's do? What we'll do is we'll print a coin for a trillion dollars. One coin, it will be worth a trillion dollars and we'll put it someplace so we'll always have that.' Somebody at the Treasury Department. ? But it is a collector's item. You can get ahold of it. I've seen a prototype. It has the beautiful profile on the trillion dollar coin of Regis Philbin. Beautiful. You can use it to pay off the national debt, the trillion dollar coin, or it will help you get a Kardashian. Either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A political opponent of his is accusing [New Jersey] Governor [Chris] Christie of praying for Hurricane Sandy. In response, Christie said, 'The only weather-related thing I've ever prayed for is a Dairy Queen Blizzard.' That's what he said. That's a quote right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview yesterday, Al Roker said in a visit to the White House, quote, 'I pooped my pants.' He's the first person to soil his pants at the White House since that time Hillary Clinton came home early and surprised Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're always hearing nobody likes Congress. Congress is unpopular. This just came out today. According to a new poll, Congress is now less popular than head lice, Nickelback and Donald Trump. In a related story, head lice is insulted it's being lumped in with Donald Trump and Nickelback.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, gun-control talk is suddenly everywhere for reasons I don't want to get into because it undermines my position. And as a result, our dear leader Obama is more determined than ever to take away our guns, in that he has never tried to take away our guns. ... But last week, he appointed Reich Marshal Biden to head up a gun safety task force that will convene a 'series of meetings' and 'offer recommendations?in an effort to build consent for action.' Meetings? Recommendations? Effort? Folks, that is a slippery slope to jackbooted PowerPoint presentations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced the theme for President Obama's inauguration will be 'Faith in America's Future,' which is proof that no one in the White House has ever seen 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama's team is promising special perks for donors who give at least $1 million to the inauguration. Which is cool, but, you know what else can get you a lot of perks? Keeping that $1 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, today the President hosted a screening of NBC's White House comedy, '1600 Penn,' which centers on a goofy guy who keeps embarrassing the White House. Or as Joe Biden put it, 'Why's everyone looking at me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the gadgets everyone is talking about this year is a fork ? this is real ? a fork that tells you when you're eating too fast. That's true. A fork that tells you when you're eating too fast. In a related story, today Chris Christie was spotted yelling at his fork to mind its own business. 'Shut up! Shut up.

That is a person whose signature goes on the right side of the bill [US currency]. And this is Jack Lew's signature. It's either his signature or the migratory pattern of a housefly.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he was chief of staff of the White House, Mr. Lew worked at Hostess as a cupcake icer. If he is approved by the Senate, his signature will appear on all newly printed US bills. It's about time bills look like they were signed by a Roomba.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in terms of diversity, the First Lady is an African-American woman, but who knows if she's staying? The way things are going, she leaves and the President replaces her with Larry Summers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Hey Lew, here's a tip: Stop signing your checks on the teacup ride at Disney World. The only way you are allowed to have that as your signature is if your name is 'Booooing, Boooing.' Please confirm Jack Lew. Please confirm Jack Lew. I have to have this man as Treasury Secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama recently came under fire from Republicans over the lack of diversity in his cabinet. Then Obama said, 'You guys know I'll be there, too, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, Obama's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, is facing criticism because his signature - which will appear on the dollar bill - is completely illegible. Look at his signature. This is real. In response, Lew is, like, 'I will fix this, or my name isn't?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today that the theme for President Obama's second inauguration will be 'Faith in America's Future.' The idea is to get our minds off of America's present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest poll, Congress has an approval of nine percent. Just nine percent of Americans approve of the job they're doing. The other 91% are holding off their opinion until Congress actually does something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the inauguration is later this month. President Obama will be sworn in with his hand resting on two Bibles. Two Bibles. Is that how screwed up Washington is now? One Bible can't get the job anymore? We need a stack of Bibles. Is that how bad it's gotten?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for President Obama's inauguration, the Madison Hotel in Washington, DC - listen to this - is offering an inaugural town and country package. Two people. It includes four nights, a private car, a driver, a social media butler, and the cost is $47,000. Unfortunately, the only people that can afford to spend that kind of money voted for Romney. Not going to get a lot of takers on that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now being criticized for the lack of diversity in his Administration. The man is half white and half black. You don't get more - he is diversity. You cannot get more diverse than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And US custom officials recently discovered 310 pounds of marijuana hidden among some frozen carrots. Hiding marijuana in frozen vegetables. See, that's one way to keep kids away from drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mentioned this last night. The age group that binge drinks the most, seniors. Senior citizens are the biggest binge drinkers. Isn't that amazing? That explains why John McCain picked Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what takes place in ten days, ladies and gentlemen, and again this is a great example of how things fly. Do you remember the presidential campaign that lasted two years, do you remember how sick and tired we were of that. Remember that? And every day it was a mudfest. And then there would be debates. And then Newt Gingrich would come. And then he would go. And it was just awful. And now ten days from now, President Obama will be inaugurated. Ten days from now he will be inaugurated. I'm telling you, it is really starting to look bad for Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just announced that there will be a concert for kids next Saturday to celebrate President Obama's inauguration featuring Alicia Keyes, Katy Perry, and Brad Paisley. Or as Joe Biden called them, 'Not the Wiggles.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news. A new survey found that 77% of Americans think politicians do serious harm to the country. Politicians are like, 'Cool, at least they think we do something. It's a win, right? Let's go out for a beer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting, speaking of the President, President Obama's half-brother is running for political office in Kenya. Yeah. Donald Trump has already accused him of being born in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that Republicans and Democrats are working on a new bill to streamline the healthcare system. It will reduce the cost of mammograms and prostate exams. But don't worry; they'll still be free at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, folks, people with extreme positions can often dominate this debate. But there are reasonable people on both sides, who are reasonably trying to blame anything but guns. For instance, Hollywood. Just look at how many of this year's Oscar nominees glamorize guns: 'Django Unchained,' 'Zero Dark Thirty,' 'Argo,' 'Lincoln' and the worst one of all 'Les Miserables.' Who among us didn't want to shoot Russell Crowe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some have said Piers [Morgan] puts only crazy people like Alex Jones on his show who oppose all restrictions on gun ownership, when he could just as easily have on reasonable people like the NRA, who oppose all restrictions on gun ownership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You sound like you all got your flu shots. Listen to this. According to the CDC, over 128 million flu vaccines have been administered this season; 128 million. That's almost as many injections as Lance Armstrong has gotten in his entire career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Associated Press, Lance Armstrong confessed during his interview with Oprah Winfrey that he did use performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times. This came as a complete shock to as many as a dozen people. You know, although he denied it for years, it was starting to become obvious. Like that one year he won the race on the stationary bike. Remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, reports say that Lance unburdened himself to Oprah and at one point it got very emotional and he began to cry. Let me tell you something, you don't mess with Oprah. If Lance thought the Tour de France was grueling, the Tour de Oprah, that is way tougher. You ever notice that? Everybody admits their secrets to Oprah. You know, Obama should make Oprah head of Homeland Security. We wouldn't have to waterboard anybody. Let Oprah interrogate them. And within 30 minutes, she'd have them crying. 'Yes, I'm a terrorist! My father never hugged me! I am a terrorist!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, the US Postal Service may now sue Lance Armstrong for the $30 million they gave him to support his team. You know what Lance should do? Forget the money. Lance should give the post office some of those performance-enhancing drugs and maybe we'll get our mail a little quicker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House has rejected an online petition to build a planet-destroying Death Star like the one in the movie 'Star Wars.' Well, an official said today that the Administration does not support blowing up planets. See, the White House believes the most effective way to destroy planets is with their economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of people, who signed up to buy tickets to the upcoming presidential inaugural ball, were left bitterly disappointed when they learned that all of the tickets had been sold before they were even available. So, let me get this straight. If we need more money in this country, we just print it. But if we need more tickets - you can't just start handing out tickets. This can cause huge problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Joe Biden has now been put in charge of the gun-control task force and he's cracking down. He's getting tough. In fact, the Vice President said today his first order of business will be to take the guns out of the hands of the last Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama, he's got a half-brother living in Kenya and the half-brother I think, is it Jerry van Obama? I'm not sure exactly that that's his name. But he's running for governor in Kenya. In Kenya. Listen to this, there's one problem. His opponents claim he was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Other Lance Armstrong Revelations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Artificially enhanced his cycling shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Still never leaves the house without several vials of clean urine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Owns Texas estate known as Rancho Decepto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Took steroids to work up the strength to admit taking steroids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Once had an inappropriate relationship with an air hose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Also has tattoo of Rex Ryan's wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Has given up on making the Baseball Hall of Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. United States Postal Service paid him in stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Started erotic website, 'Tour de Pants.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Admitted to doping just to get on 'Oprah'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah Winfrey says she conducted an intense two-and-a-half hour interview with Lance Armstrong. Oprah says she never would have had the stamina if Lance wouldn't have given her something to keep going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama told Congress it must raise our debt limit because the US 'is not a deadbeat nation.' Then the President added, 'By the way, if China calls, I'm not here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart made a big announcement. Wal-Mart made plans to hire 100,000 US veterans, which can only mean one thing - Wal-Mart is going to invade Costco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about Oprah's interview with Lance Armstrong, where he finally admitted to doping. And get this. The interview supposedly lasted close to three hours. So, it's sort of like a regular interview, but, you know, on steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's inaugural parade will feature eight floats, including a Hawaii float to honor his birthplace, an Illinois float to honor the First Lady's home state, and a Kenyan float just to mess with Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, I heard the President will push for a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the US. Obama says it's all part of his plan to give every man, woman and child the chance to pay more taxes. And that's just the American way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news out of Washington. Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced that he will stay at the White House for President Obama's second term. He said his mission is to make the US number one in education and won't stop until our students are doing gooder. He won't stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that NASA just spent $18 million to add an extra room to the International Space Station. Could have been cheaper, but NASA's wife demanded granite countertops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believed in you Lance Armstrong! I shelled out a dollar for a rubber bracelet that I have somewhere in my house. For you! I did it for you. And when I think of the fact that I spent a dollar - well, I think we all owe cancer an apology. Or is that not the lesson in all this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lance Armstrong was doping. Of course he was doping. It was so obvious. You can beat testicular cancer and you can win the Tour de France, but you can't win the Tour de France seven times after beating testicular cancer. Or vice versa. Which would mean you won the Tour de France and then subsequently lost seven testicles. That can't happen either. Armstrong was doping. It seems so obvious in hindsight. It's like when you find out the tooth fairy isn't real for the first time and then you think about it and you're like, 'Of course, a winged fairy with no job spends her life collecting baby teeth, yet somehow always has money in her pocket to give out.' Defies credibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you can feel the energy in this room tonight, because there's one story rocking this nation. A bombshell dropped by my hero, Lance Armstrong, master of the two-wheeler. Rumors have been swirling for years about Lance, but unlike most Americans, when times got tough, I didn't get off the tandem bike of admiration. No! I saddled up, rang the bell of loyalty, put down the kickstand of support, stayed in it to Schwinn it, and - I've run out of bike metaphors. Point is, the man's a hero. He beat cancer. Then went on to beat something even less popular: The French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such a great day for Lance Armstrong. He admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. He confessed in front of the most respected judge in the land, Oprah Winfrey. Apparently, the interview went pretty well when Oprah told the studio audience, 'You get steroids, you get steroids, you all get steroids!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, during a routine cleanup, park crews discovered a cannon from the Revolutionary War that was still loaded. Old, loaded, ready to go. It's like me before the show. And they say the thing for a while was deadly dangerous and could blow up like that. But don't worry. New York City police did what they could. They put one of those orange cones by it. And then, then they found themselves a Revolutionary cannon-defusing, disarming expert team, squad that came in, and it took them a long time. They had to empty the powder. They had to take out the fuse. They had to get rid of the cannonball. And finally, after hours and hours of tedious disarm, the thing was absolutely safe. And immediately, the NRA was furious, furious!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know about the NRA. They're now saying they want all teachers to have guns, all teachers to have guns. But they still must use those scissors with the rounded safeties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody here got the flu, am I right? You all have the flu? I'm telling you. It's bad. They say everybody's going to get the flu. As a matter of fact, earlier today, I heard Lance Armstrong?I heard him admit to using Tamiflu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people, when the election was over and folks started yakking about the fiscal cliff, turned off the television set or threw it out the window? The fiscal cliff, does it have any bearing on your lives? Anybody here worried? No, and I'll tell you why. We don't know what it is. In my case, when you don't know what something is, you don't care about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Checking the web, here. President Obama signed 23 gun control measures today and called on Congress to ban assault weapons and 100 round magazines. There goes my fishing trip, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I swear to you, if I didn't know any better - and I'm not a big conspiracy guy - I would think the NRA is an elaborate avant-garde, Joaquin Phoenix-style joke or a false-flag operation run by Michael Moore in an attempt to discredit responsible gun owners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about this ? Oprah's big interview with Lance Armstrong is tomorrow night. It's a pretty big deal. Oprah said to get ready, she prepared 112 questions. Yeah. First question was, 'Did you use steroids?' The next 111 questions were, 'Oh, come on, you used steroids, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they're saying Lance may be forced to return the endorsement money he received from the US Postal Service. I mean, seriously? I'm pretty sure the only group that's lied more than Lance Armstrong is the US Postal Service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Sunday, the White House will hold a private swearing-in ceremony for President Obama. Not to be outdone, on Sunday, Republicans will hold a private swearing-at ceremony for President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, they tried to interview one of the cyclists who did not take performance enhancing drugs, but they couldn't because he's still out there. He hasn't crossed the finish line yet. He's still ? he's still pedaling ? I think he's just coming over the Alps right about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said this week that he wants to find a pathway for citizenship for immigrants of the United States. Really? Don't we have that? It is called the Rio Grande River.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, thousands of dead fish have now washed up on shore along the coast of South Carolina. Today, the NRA said that this wouldn't have happened if those fish had had guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ann Romney, the lovely wife of Mitt Romney, has reportedly turned down a chance to appear on 'Dancing with the Stars.' Apparently, she has something called 'self-respect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said ? actually they did ask her. She says she loves to dance and is a big fan of the show. But she said she'd rather stay home with 'The Biggest Loser.' So, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, which is Martin Luther King Day, the presidential inauguration celebration [will take place] as Barack Obama begins his second term as President of the United States in Washington, DC. They'll have parades. They'll have entertainment. They have music from Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Queen Latifah. Movie stars like Kirsten Dunst, Alfre Woodard, Queen Latifah. A lot of Queen Latifah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President will be sworn in on Sunday by Chief Justice John Roberts. They have to do it on Sunday, because legally it has to take place on January 20th. But I have a feeling most people will be too focused on football and Honey Boo Boo to watch any of the inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, ladies and gentlemen, it's a big weekend coming up, and on Monday?President Barack Obama will become President Barack Obama again for the second time. It's the swearing in - the big inauguration, and listen to this: When they give the oath of office, he'll be sworn in on two Bibles. All right, we get it, you're not a Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, folks, pretty soon our sandwiches are going to be metric because America is finished. Yesterday, Obama shredded the Constitution and anointed himself King Gun Snatcher the Magnificent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President should focus on the strengthening the policies that we know are keeping us safe, like making sure nobody brings tweezers onto an airplane. Of course, Obama knew his gun-grab wasn't going to pass the smell test, so he stooped to surrounding himself with children. Like this confused boy, Joey. He loves trains. Folks, it was a transparent appeal to our humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why aren't kids writing the President about long-term restructuring of government debt. Come on Fox News youngsters, Benny, Roz, the rest of the Pinecrest retirement crew. Put down the Sunny D and fire up the Underwood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully, folks, our Constitution has a built-in mechanism to stop democratically elected tyrants from taking our guns, and that brings us to tonight's word: 'United We Standoff.' President Obama and his anti-gun storm troopers say it's okay for me to have a pistol. It's okay for me to have a rifle and a shotgun. But it's not okay for me to have military-style weaponry. Maybe they've forgotten what the second amendment is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like anybody setting up a new government, the founders added a clause that said, 'If you don't like what we're doing, feel free to shoot us.' It's like?the Second Amendment is like the ultimate veto. It's almost like a constitutional prenup. That is why I and my friends at Fox News have always stood with those who arm themselves against government tyranny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But?today America has the world's greatest military, full of brave men and women armed with the most powerful weaponry ever devised. And it is because I respect our troops so much that I need a fully-automatic assault rifle with a 100-round magazine to kill them when they come for my guns. Because realistically?just think about this: You think that that AR-15 is going to save you when Uncle Sam comes knocking with an Apache helicopter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, now if the Second Amendment is truly to defend ourselves against government&quot; forces, &quot;then citizens will never be safe until we can have our own aircraft carriers. Now, I know what some out there are saying: 'Might some deranged individual take their constitutionally-guaranteed aircraft carrier to a mall, let's say, and rain Hellfire missiles down on a Cinnabon for skimping on the frosting?' Well, of course. There's no stopping that. But as Jefferson said, 'Sometimes the tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of the innocent.' Look it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Mr. King President, unless you and the anti-gun brigade will admit that we gun owners are constitutionally guaranteed the right to have any weapon we want, we will use every weapon we can get to keep every weapon we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the executive orders. That's what makes him a tyrant. Let's see what King Obama is bypassing Congress to do. Let me see. I have it right here. He has executive-ordered a launch of a national and safe responsible gun ownership campaign. He's ordered nomination of an ATF director, a launch on a dialog on mental health and, this is the one that appears to have caused the most controversy, the Centers of Disease Control to conduct research in the cause of gun violence and the ways to prevent it? Really? Tyranny? Because when I listen to that, that ain't (bleep) Hitler. I guess Hannity wants to protect American liberties and would stand up to any presidential overreach even if it was done in saving lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news. In a recent attack ad, the NRA claims that President Obama cares about his own children more than he cares about other children. In response, President Obama was like, 'Yeah, that's how families work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to wonder what's in the future for Lance Armstrong. It doesn't look good. The guy's a liar, cheat, a hypocrite, a fraud. Where is he going to find work? Okay, besides Congress. I mean, besides Congress, there are not a lot of options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to first lady, Michelle Obama - 49 years old today. Happy birthday. She told a reporter she'd like a nice gift from Barack, but nothing extravagant. Oh, don't worry. Obama is very responsible when he's spending his own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the usual sort of birthday party. They wheeled out a huge cake with ice cream and then Michelle yelled at everybody not to eat it. 'We have brussel sprouts, you know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study came out that shows that New York City is better at eliminating childhood obesity. Mostly because they force the fat kids to move out and become the governor of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of you may be surprised to see a Supreme Court Justice here. One, because she is a sitting Supreme Court Justice and two, because this afternoon she was in Washington administering the public oath of office to Vice President Biden. Doesn't it look like Biden just wants to high-five her? Probably the hardest part of swearing in Biden is explaining to him that you don't actually get to swear.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He [Obama] already took the oath yesterday at the White House! By taking it again today, Obama has made himself a three-term President serving the second two terms consecutively. Now to get rid of him we have to impeach him twice. Oh, clever girl. And besides, it's his second inaugural. Why the celebration? He's already President. You don't see the rest of America throwing a party when they continue to do their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll admit I was swept up four years ago. I was moved by the first black President. But come on, a second inaugural is like people who renew their wedding vows. We get it, you're married! I'm not buying you another salad bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then came the presidential pride parade, with eight floats from Obama and Biden's home states [of] Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, which honored Delaware by just driving through the parade on its way to somewhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm not going to do a critical deconstruction of Obama's partisan screed masquerading as an inaugural speech. Now is not the time to criticize. I will just say this: It was a clear call for a radical, collectivist agenda. ? Socialist overreach is coming. By February, we'll all be chained up in solar-powered asparagus gulags being force-fed birth control pills by illegal immigrants, who gay-marry us to endangered sea turtles. My advice: Find a good looking turtle-mate soon; you don't want to end up with a butter-beak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well nation, I will not sit idly by while Obama rubs our noses in the will of the electorate. So tonight, I am re-inaugurating myself as Commander-in-Opposing-the-Chief for an historic second term. Boys, roll out the Bibles! Brief historical note: These Bibles once belonged to Lincoln, Nebraska's Red Roof Inn. So, here we go. I, the Reverend Sir Dr. Stephen T. Mos Def Colbert, DFA, heavyweight champion of the world, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully reject this President of the United States. And will, to the best of my knowledge, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and ensure he's a one two-term President. In sickness and in health, so help me God, play ball, the tribe has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to President Obama on his second inauguration yesterday. I thought he gave a terrific speech. He gave a great speech! You know, on the news they made a big deal out of the fact that four years ago, there were twice as many people at his first inauguration than there was at this one. Well, yeah. That's because four years ago, twice as many people could afford to stay in hotels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know who gave the shortest inauguration speech in history? George Washington. It was only like three minutes long. Well, sure. See, George Washington, he couldn't tell a lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Post Office may sue Lance Armstrong for all of the money they spent sponsoring his team. In fact, after all these lawsuits, they say that Lance Armstrong could end up as broke as the Post Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who checked out the inaugural ball last night? Did you watch that on TV? ? I don't know if you saw this at the inaugural ball, President Obama was caught doing some very stiff and awkward dance moves. Did you see that? Yeah. In other words, Obama is already reaching out to Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was all part and parcel of the pomp and circumstance of President Barack Obama's second inauguration. Yesterday's events had everything a true inaug-o-file would love. .. While the day celebrated Barack Obama, the breakout star was none other than New York State's senior Senator, Charles Schumer, who hosted the festivities and who was able to enhance the staged tradition of the ceremony with the exhilarating rhythm of post-Shabbat service announcements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course inauguration day isn't all ceremony. At its center, is the President's speech where he articulates the vision of governance in the next four years ? It's a call to action like JFK's 'Ask not what your country can do you,' or FDR, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,' or Jimmy Carter's somewhat inexplicable 'She's a brick house, she's mighty, mighty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still reeling from yesterday's inauguration disaster. First off, where was security? The Secret Service is supposed to protect the President and First Lady, but in the middle of a kiss, they were viciously photo-bombed. Enjoy Gitmo, Malia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the more I think about, the less impressed I am with Obama's speech. And it's not just me. It's everyone on Fox News. ? Yes, at his heart he is a socialist. Ever notice how it shares the blood with all the other organs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is Obama's inaugural speech was a swing and a miss, not just for what he did say, but for what he did not say. ? Yeah, where was the hopelessness? That's what the American public wants! I mean, who could forget FDR's famous inaugural when he proclaimed: 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and also a second depression, rampant starvation, and my gut's telling me Europe's a tinderbox. Ah, what's the point? We're all doomed! I can't walk! I can't walk!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, what are you going to do? We're looking at four more years of this guy, and thanks to Obamacare, we might live to see it. Where did we go wrong? The Republicans had everything going for them: A terrible economy, an unpopular incumbent, and a positive message for the American voter: Less than half of you are parasites. And still - still we lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with America's changing demographics, it only looks bleaker for Republicans in the future, unless science can find a way for Latino women to give birth to old white men. Where is the funding, Koch brothers?! Get on it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming. I appreciate that. I hope you had a good holiday weekend. It was an historic weekend for sure. More than a million people gathered in our nation's capital yesterday, and tens of millions more watched from home to celebrate the First Lady's new haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is funny that bangs are what most people talked about yesterday. It's interesting that Mrs. Obama chose inauguration weekend to unveil it. I have a theory as to why she did that. I'll give it to you in three words - giant forehead zit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the President gave a brief but powerful speech. He did not shy away from the many challenges he faces: a massive Federal deficit, a conservative majority in the House, an aging population, runaway entitlements, humongous ears. The list goes on and on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately following the inauguration, the President, his family and select guests were invited to a traditional luncheon at the Capitol. This is something they do. Speaker of the House John Boehner was seated next to the Obamas, and a camera caught a great moment. In this clip, you see Boehner saying something to the President, and he taps the First Lady. And then continued his conversation, and now watch her roll her eyes there. She's even acting like a girl with bangs now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big announcement for the American military today. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has decided to lift the ban on women in combat, which could potentially open more than 230,000 military positions previously unavailable to women. I think that's great. This is a sign that?we've really advanced as a nation. Now, women can fight for honor on the field of battle and on 'The Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the DEA says drug smugglers in Mexico are using cannons to shoot marijuana over into the US. They are! They have three distances, the cannons. Far, really far and Willie Nelson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if Beyonce lip-synced at Obama's inaugural, do you know what that means? If so, please write in, because I'd love to know why I'm so angry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This comes as a heartbreaking allegation, because we were all moved by Ms. Knowles' performance. None more so than Joe Biden?That man either loves this country very much, or Chuck Schumer just ripped one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people were led to believe she had delivered the most stirring rendition of our national anthem since Francis Scott Key first sang it at America's original Super Bowl - a cage fight between a bear and a China man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay. Let's break it down. Let's break this down. Now, here's the timeline. Late Monday, sources in the Marine Corps band, who allegedly accompanied Beyonce, leaked the information that 'Beyonce decided shortly before her performance to rely on the studio version rather than risk singing it live on the capitol.' Because evidently, this time, it was the jelly that was not ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then accusations start flying that the Marine Corps band 'wasn't actually playing during the song.' Oh, so now we can't trust the Marines?! What this does is undermine our faith in the military. Do we have a proper chain of command? Are we really even at war in Afghanistan? Or are we just lip-syncing to an old recording of Vietnam? Mr. President, Mr. President, the American people demand answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday, of course, was President Obama's inauguration. All the networks covered it, except for Fox. They ran their big 'Joanie loves Chachi' marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his inaugural address, President Obama praised the patriots of 1776, and said they were much better than the Patriots of last Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden?we love Joe Biden. He made another one of his famous gaffes on camera Monday, saying he was 'proud to be President of the United States.' I guess he forgot he wasn't at home standing in front of the bathroom mirror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a big story. Apparently, Beyonce did not sing the national anthem at the inauguration. She pretended to sing along to a prerecorded track. You know who caught her? Lance Armstrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for Lance Armstrong. There are now rumors going around that when he was sponsored by the US Postal Service, he shipped all his steroids and blood-doping materials UPS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steven Tyler defended Beyonce after she lip-synced at President Obama's inauguration. That's right. Steven Tyler said, 'I know how she feels. I did the same thing at Harry Truman's inauguration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up until now, the only thing that got the French angry enough to fight was serving a bordelaise sauce with fish. France is putting the hurt to Al Qaeda in Mali with planes, troops and its 'most sophisticated helicopter gunship,' which, in France, means a gunship that fires missiles at itself in a Dadaist commentary on the cruel farce that is war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bold military action even surprised the French, whose president, Fran?ois Hollande, is perceived as so indecisive and weak, he's earned the nickname 'flanby,' after a wobbly gelatin dessert.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interestingly, one of the reasons that Hollande is so unpopular in the first place is that he's the one pushing the gay marriage initiative. But as one paper put it, 'Mali could transform Hollande's political image.' Their wars make their leaders look tough, just like ours do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to take a minute right now to talk about the big story tonight: My anger and disappointment. It's been four months since the terror attack on our embassy in Benghazi, Libya. And every day since, the American people on Fox News have demanded that the American people demand answers. Well, yesterday we finally had their chance to hold Hillary Clinton's feet to the car on fire. And at hearings in the Senate and the House intelligence committees, congressional Republicans proved definitively that they suck at their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the hearings were a debacle that left unanswered the one question they were really about: Is there anything we can use to stop Hillary in 2016?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As each one of you in succession has pointed out, someone at State should have seen the cable from Benghazi, popped it upstairs to someone upstairs with more authority than State, and given those people at the consulate more security. That's a fair point that you don't have to all identically make. But you know, you ain't dealing with a rookie here guys. This ain't Clinton's first go-round at the finger-pointing rodeo. I mean, Clinton's like a finger-point Magneto. I mean, you come at her and she'll turn it around on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is this for quality? Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that women in all branches of the military will have the opportunity to serve on the front lines in battle. Panetta said he had no idea women could be such vicious fighters until he saw a couple episodes of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a scary moment at John Kerry's Secretary of State confirmation hearing. One of the senators had taken his Ambien the night before and combined with the stuffy room and Kerry's boring speech, he slipped into a coma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner said that President Obama's focus is to 'annihilate; the Republican Party. Do the Republicans look like they need help from President Obama? There doing a hell of a job themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton. Did you see her yesterday on television? Yesterday, she was grilled by congressmen on the attack in Benghazi. Then, out of habit, she grilled them about where they were last night and 'Who's this Megan?' Got ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon has decided to allow women to serve in combat. It's a true story, yeah. Yeah, the hope is that we can now finally defeat the Taliban by giving them the silent treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea said it will test a rocket that they hope will hit the United States. In other words, watch your back, middle of the Pacific Ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has parted ways with Fox News as one of their correspondents. Well apparently, she couldn't give the network what they wanted - a coherent sentence. She said she wanted to spend more time with her family 'cause they didn't bother to fact-check everything she says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And lawmakers in Washington, DC look like they're finally getting serious about passing comprehensive immigration reform. This is a big deal. Under this new plan, all immigrants who are already here - if you're here in America illegally - they can stay, even the ones that aren't carrying Arnold Schwarzenegger's babies. They can stay as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'New England Journal of Medicine,' smokers lose at least one decade off their life expectancy, compared to non-smokers. However, the cost of living has gone up, so it's cheaper to buy cigarettes now and die sooner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Manti Te'o, thing. He's in college, not just a college, not like West Undershirt, Wyoming. It's Notre Dame. He's a star athlete, football player, linebacker at Notre Dame, runner-up for the Heisman. Turns out, for four years he's dating a woman he has never seen. And they would only talk on the phone. And I would think you had an imaginary girlfriend for four years, think about that. And then I thought, well, if the Republicans, if they could have come up with five million imaginary female voters, by God, Romney would be President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women serving in the United States military will now be serving in combat, ladies and gentlemen. Finally, there will be somebody in the tank who will stop and ask for directions. Rick Santorum heard about it. He said, 'Great, what's next? They're going to let women vote?' That's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyonce, I mean here's the thing. ? They caught her lip syncing at the inauguration, yup, they caught her.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did a joint interview on '60 Minutes.' ... Of course, the big moment everyone was talking about is when President Obama offered Hillary a rose and asked her to stay. Wasn't that romantic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey Governor Chris Christie &quot;has rejected an increase to the minimum wage. ... As a result, Christie got a lot of dirty looks today when he went to McDonald's, Arby's, Wendy's, Burger King and Long John Silver's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a crazy story. A little sad. A Secret Service dog died during a fundraiser where Vice President Joe Biden was giving a speech. Yeah. The dog is being described as 'lucky.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared on '60 Minutes' for their first joint interview.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the interview, President Obama poked fun at members of the press for speculating on the 2016 election, calling them 'incorrigible.' And Biden said, 'Wait, they have to wear diapers?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While speaking to fellow Republicans on Friday, Mitt Romney said that he's not going away, and he will continue to help the party. To which Republicans said, 'You got to pick one or the other.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On women in combat] &quot;Oh, with their wee little hands and their wee little feet. Have you ever seen them eat? They pick up a dinner roll like this. And tiny, little sharp teeth. Wait a minute. I'm thinking of mice. Mice should not be serving in the military. No matter how adorable they might be. Sergeant Whiskers, I can't napalm you. As for the 'woman are too weak argument,' it would be a bad idea to send the 177th Linebacker Brigade to fight side-by-side with the Pixie Regiment, but to avoid that confusion maybe the military could have a requirement pertaining to physical fitness. Maybe a physical fitness requirement?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, that won't address the real problem of having women in the field. ? Eros is a very powerful and irrational passion? That is a terrible argument for keeping women out of combat, but a wonderful campaign for a new fragrance. 'For the irrational passion in you, Eros.' ? Maybe you put a lid on this sexual misbehavior by again having some sort of standard or code that governs how the military conducts itself. Some kind of a military code of conduct, if you will.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI is investigating New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez for allegedly soliciting Dominican prostitutes. So, once again, foreign workers doing the jobs Americans don't want to do, right? The FBI says Menendez agreed to pay the prostitutes $500, but then only gave them $100. So, he had sex like a Democrat, but was fiscally conservative like a Republican. That's what we need in Washington! We need more men like that! Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Sarah Palin has parted ways with Fox News. Network executives said she was unfair and unbalanced. Well, I guess Fox News realized she's a woman, she's not blonde, she's over 40. She had to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to reports from 'Psychological Science,' people eat more junk food and gain weight during tough economic times. Well, how ironic is that? I mean, the biggest obstacles in Michelle Obama's war on obesity is President Obama's economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is kind of cool. The NBA champion Miami Heat were guests of President Obama at the White House. Coincidentally, several members of the Lakers were there, too, but they were just seeking disaster-relief funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the wake of Colorado legalizing marijuana, lawmakers there are now having a tough time figuring out what the legal limit should be for those that are, you know, caught smoking while driving - if they're too high to drive. What's the legal limit? Here's a good standard, okay? If when you get pulled over and the cop tells you roll down your window and you order a cheeseburger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took questions on Facebook. Kind of cool. Then afterwards, Bill Clinton showed her how to erase her browser history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What separates conservatives from liberals is that conservatives think government is bad and people are good. Unless the people work in government, then they are bad. But they can leave government, go to a lobbying firm and become good again. It's a complicated theory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, the other threat to America is President Obama's recent 23-point executive order gun-control grab-o-rama. ? But this tyranny will not stand,&quot; and several states have introduced legislation &quot;that would make it illegal to enforce any of the new Federal gun control measures. ... That means if an agent of the Federal government tries to take your high-capacity magazine, just call 911 and say 'Police! Come quick! Someone's trying to enforce the law.' Then they'll send in a SWAT team to shoot themselves. Because these states know that there's a higher authority than some stupid law made by Washington clowns on Capitol Hill, and that's some stupid law made by local clowns in your state capitol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, each state picking and choosing which laws to obey finally realizes the vision of our forefathers. As Lincoln said, 'A house divided against itself-- sounds fun! What's the worst that could happen?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama sat down for an interview with Telemundo to rally support for his immigration plan. Good. He told the Telemundo network that implementing immigration reform was the primary gooooal!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was kind of interesting. Zimbabwe's finance minister revealed yesterday during a press conference that his country ? the entire country ? has only $217 left in the government treasury. Today, President Obama said, 'Stop bragging.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama went to Las Vegas and spoke about his new immigration plan and...afterwards, was harshly criticized by the locals for speaking in English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Senate has overwhelmingly approved John Kerry as the next Secretary of State. Well, in his farewell speech today to the Senate, Kerry spoke for 51 minutes. 51 minutes. So, apparently he does believe in torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry is the first white male to hold that job since 1997. So, finally middle-aged, white guys with gray hair are breaking through the glass ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama looked like he was having fun this week. You know, he is a huge basketball fan. And he had the world champion Miami Heat at the White House. And, you know, if he was into NBA players any more, he would have to change his last name to Kardashian. Okay? That's all I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

This will put the finger on the pulse of this nation and give you an idea how you're supposed to feel about a wide variety of topics. We call it 'Charts and Graphs.' Let's start with a couple, see how they go. The first one, the category is the 'biggest issue facing our country today.' Let's see what America thinks is the biggest issue facing our country today. Fifty-six percent said poor economy, 43% said national debt, one percent said beverage greater than 16 ounces.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, as President Obama is pushing for some new gun regulations, he's struggling to gain credibility from skeptical gun owners. In a recent interview with 'The New Republic' magazine, Obama mounted a frontal attack?This seems wrong on many levels. For starters, Obama appears to think the best place to reach out to gun owners is the pages of 'The New Republic.' A bit of a tell right there. It's like saying, 'I was telling 'Ms. Magazine' I love NASCAR and I have myself driven multiple Dodge Chargers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, this week, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a plan that would create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Yep, a path to citizenship. Or as illegal immigrants call that, a tunnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GOP lost the Hispanic vote by 44 points, 71% to 27%. Eleven million Hispanics voted for Obama. To put that in perspective, if you laid them all end to end, and stacked them ten high, you'd have a pretty good start on a border wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know people still are trying to figure out why the power went out Sunday at the Super Bowl. Today, they found out the reason. Turns out China cut off the electricity for nonpayment of our bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study released today, 65% of people say they would not date someone who is more than $5,000 in debt. Good thing President Obama got married before he got into office, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Daily News,' US Immigration agents who arrest undocumented aliens are sometimes rewarded with Home Depot gift cards as bonuses. They get a Home Depot gift card, which is not a bad idea. You go to Home Depot to make a purchase, and with the cash you get back, you can hire the day laborer you just arrested who's hanging around the parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Abbottabad, that's where Osama bin Laden was living for ten years with his seven or eight wives and his 40 kids. It was a huge complex just out side of Abbottabad and much bigger than any house in town and the locals thought maybe it was George Clooney living there. So Abbottabad has had some worldwide recognition. This is a true story. They're building a theme park in Abbottabad, Pakistan. ? Nobody's laughing at my timeshare now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Justice Department memo claims that President Obama has the right to order the assassination of an American anywhere in the world. Isn't that crazy? In a related story, Donald Trump has gone into hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea has released a propaganda video using the song, 'We Are the World.' yeah. At this rate, North Korea may have the technical knowledge to solve the Rubik's Cube.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some political news. Mitt Romney's son Tagg - he is denying reports that he will run for Senate this year saying the timing isn't right. Just like when his dad tries to clap along to a song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department announced that John Kerry, the newly appointed Secretary of State, will sign all official State Department tweets with his initials, J.K. You can see the confusion here. Because J.K. is also Internet slang for 'just kidding.' Let's just take a look at a few of his tweets. You'll see what I mean. Here's the first one, 'I'm thrilled and honored to uphold the position of Secretary of State, J.K.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pakistan is opening an amusement park and zoo. It's a zoo in the same town where the raid on Osama bin Laden took place. The zoo is pretty cool, but I heard you won't be able to see the SEALs until it's too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, to prevent a monopoly, the Department of Justice is trying to block Anheuser-Busch from buying Corona. So they did what everyone else does, they got their older brother to buy it for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, kind of a funny thing happened in this year's presidential election. Amidst the worst economy in decades, high unemployment and a steep spiritual decline, the country chose not a self-made and virtuous patriot to heal our woes but the same foreign-born socialist tyrant who created all of our woes. How did Republicans lose this eminently winnable presidential race? Messaging. If only people knew what the Republicans were about. What the Republicans need is some kind of 24-hours a day, seven days a week perpetual messaging refinement and distribution resource, preferably one close to the trappings of journalistic authority but without any ethical constraint. What would we call such a place? Elephant News is too obvious? Insane Clone Posse is already taken. Ferret! Ferret News!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the past few years, the postal service has been losing billions of dollars so to cut costs, starting in August, they will no longer deliver mail on Saturdays. ? They will still deliver packages on Saturday, just not regular mail, which means we'll only get the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond coupon packet on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Fridays now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks ever watch the Fox News? Listen to this, in the last two months, they have fired Sarah Palin, former part-time governor of Alaska, and Dick Morris, well-known political pundit. Fired both of them, Fox News. Well, great. Two more jobs lost under Obama. Thanks a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans for Common Cents is a lobby group that 'aims to inform and educate policymakers, consumers, and the media about the penny's economic, cultural, and historical significance.' ... For instance, did you know historians tell us there was a time when pennies were useful?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Americans for Common Cents backs everything up with science evidence, like a recent poll which showed that 'almost two-thirds of Americans still feel the penny should be retained.' And you can trust that poll, because it was conducted by leading opinion researchers Coinstar. Of course Coinstar, clearly impartial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Postal Service announced that it will stop delivering mail on Saturdays in an effort to save two billion dollars a year. Postal workers were shocked. They were like, 'We were supposed to deliver mail on Saturdays?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just revealed that the Federal Reserve was hacked on Sunday. That's pretty serious. In fact, they're saying the hackers could've made off with as much as negative $14 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, I heard that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un recently got a Smartphone. You could tell it's a Smartphone because, today, it left North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, before the Super Bowl was played, you know, they make up the Super Bowl champion jerseys and hats for both teams. ... So that way, no matter who wins, you know they're ready with stuff to sell.&quot; The jerseys of the losing team &quot;are donated to countries in Africa and South America, which is good news 'cause those people are really getting tired of wearing those President Romney T-shirts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that the Justice Department has concluded that the President can order drone strikes on American citizens. And today, Rush Limbaugh came out in favor of Obama-care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study released Monday by the Center for Economic Policy and Research says that working fewer hours can slow global warming. ... You know what that means? President Obama's economic policy is also his climate change policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Postal Service announced today they are ending Saturday delivery of the mail. Now, if you have a problem, you want to complain to the post office you can email them at USPS.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Time' magazine is reporting that since Al Gore sold his TV network to Al Jazeera, he is now worth more money than Mitt Romney. ... But you know something? Mitt Romney and Al Gore both prove one thing: no matter how much money you have, you still can't buy a personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next year's super bowl takes place in New Jersey. The NFL says it wants to prevent another blackout. ... This one involves keeping Chris Christie away from his microwave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A member of Congress is criticizing Steven Spielberg after he discovered parts of the movie 'Lincoln' are historically inaccurate. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans have their own line of clothing. Who knew that? ... I didn't. The problem is it keeps coming apart at the seams.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all know mayor Bloomberg? This guy is tough and he's on a campaign to make New York City a better place to live. Guess what he's done now? He's outlawing Styrofoam cups. ... He wants New York City to have the nation's toughest cup control laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Mayor may have gone nuts. We have a garbage problem. I don't know if you folks noticed the teeming steaming piles of giant garbage as you came into the theater. So the Mayor put together a garbage task force and here's what they deal to combat the giant garbage ? he's bringing in more rats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, 2016 will be here before we know it. That's why Republicans need to start searching for the perfect candidate now. Who will it be? Jeb Bush, half of Chris Christie, or do we track down that Zoltar machine so Bobby Jindal can make a wish to grow big?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, experience tells us that the best place to find a winning candidate is the state senate. Just two years before Barack Obama announced his presidential run, he was a lowly state senator, making state legislatures are the farm teams of American politics - which brings me to another installment of our sometimes-running series: 'Mr. Smith Goes to the State Legislature, Then Later, Possibly Washington.' First up, tonight Tennessee state senator and lost Weasley brother, Stacey Campfield. I first noticed Campfield when he demonstrated his knowledge of immunology by declaring that 'AIDS was caused by one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. It was an airline pilot if I recall.' Yes, and if I recall, it was shortly after that that airlines stopped serving free cocktails to monkeys in first class. Pilots couldn't resist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I've long-admired Campfield's heroic work protecting our students' morals with his 'don't say gay' bill, which proposed banning teachers from discussing homosexuality in school. Yes, if you don't talk about something, it goes away. For instance, Sarah Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course a reexamation of drone policy is not the only issue facing the Administration and our nation's military. In three weeks we face the next sequestration deadline, which means if Congress can't agree to a deficit reduction plan moving forward the automatic $85 billion across the board spending cuts that Congress put into place to force themselves to agree on a deficit reduction plan will take effect. Yeah it's as stupid as it sounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defense budget, we're not going to be ready to protect the country and defense spending cuts will have economic impacts as well. For instance, if the sequester kicks in not only will our international readiness be degraded. Things like the Blue Angels air show and Fleet Week will be canceled. No Fleet Week means no Cher music videos. No Cher music videos means shares of mesh thong body stockings take a big hit. That factory closes throwing dozens of lingerie workers off the job. Next thing you know we're back in a recession and forced to wear our underwear back on the inside. Devastating consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After passing a ban on large sugary sodas, mayor Bloomberg is considering a ban on Styrofoam cups. Seriously? At this point I'm starting to think 7-Eleven slept with his girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is in talks to become a contributor on Fox News. First they have to check his background and test his knowledge of current events. And if he fails, he'll start Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republicans have announced that Senator Marco Rubio will deliver the official GOP response to President Obama's state of the union address in both English and Spanish. See, that's ridiculous. There's no need to do it in two languages? For what? The few English-speaking people that are left? I mean, how many of them are there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A second-grade boy in Denver suspended from school for pretending to throw an imaginary hand grenade at a bunch of imaginary monsters on the playground. ... Suspended for pretending. Isn't that kind of hypocritical? We have an entire government that's pretending to tighten gun control laws. Why aren't they suspended?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department is saying that President Obama can order drone strikes on American citizens, that he can do it. In a related story, this is the last Obama joke I'm ever doing on this show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of today, the US Senate has a record number of African-American senators: two. That's a record. In other words there are more African-Americans in the Senate than at a Mumford &amp; Sons concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, President Obama gave his State of the Union Address. You know what I love? At every State of the Union Address, the President is always introduced by some guy who walks in and goes, 'Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States!' You know, if we're really serious about reducing the size of government, start with that guy, okay? I mean, what does he work - one day a year? You know, Joe Biden's got nothing to do. Let him introduce the President. We're already paying him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know why the White House scheduled the State of the Union Address for Lincoln's birthday today instead of Washington's Birthday? Well, it's because Washington was famous for saying, 'I cannot tell a lie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and for the first time ever...when the President walks into the chamber, instead of 'Hail to the Chief,' they played 'Hey, Big Spender.' I thought that was kind of interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you watched the State of the Union Address just for the commercials?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have got to hand it to President Obama. This is his first State of the Union Address in his second term and he is very - he is full of confidence, really kind of cocky and full of himself. At the end of his State of the Union Address, he showed America his Kenyan birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight at the State of the Union Address, the CEO of Apple and a NASA engineer both sat with Michelle Obama. Yep. The President said he hopes it sends a message to Americans that if you can't sit close to your wife, surround her with nerds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Nugent will attend the State of the Union tonight. Or as deer call it, 'The greatest night of their lives.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, tonight Barack Hussein Obama gets to give his annual 'Look at me, I'm the President' speech. ? Obama shouldn't even be up there giving the speech. 2012 was supposed to be the GOP's year. With the economy in shambles, they thought the race was theirs to lose. And they were right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's not just the presidency. The Republicans also lost seats in the Senate, lost the popular vote in the House. And briefly lost Paul Ryan in the mall. He was supposed to hold on to his mother's hand! They found him busting a union at the Build-a-Bear Workshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To plot their path back to power, the GOP recently held a three-day conference in Williamsburg, Virginia, which is the perfect location, because the Republican platform also re-enacts the 18th century. They say they went there for a little self-reflection. Exactly what men inspired by Ayn Rand need - more time thinking about themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They [the GOP] also reached out to voters with a web-survey asking how they can improve their messaging. And a computerized web survey is the perfect way to hear from Republicans' core constituency of the extremely old. The number one suggestion was, 'Hello? Hello? How does this thing make toast?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, Republicans have got 2014 in the bag. Or they would, if not for political strategist and unlanced boil Karl Rove. You see, instead of joining his fellow Republicans in learning nothing from the last election, Karl has turned on them. Karl's bogus claim is that Tea Partiers cost Republicans winnable races by backing polarizing candidates, like Todd 'legitimate rape' Akin, and Richard 'somehow even worse on rape' Mourdock. Meanwhile, the manatee with the plan-atee wants the party to get behind the kind of mainstream, electable Republicans he's backed, like near-winner Connie Mack, strong runner-up Linda McMahon, and so-close-but-didn't-get-it George Allen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Tea Party isn't going to take Karl's new stab-you-in-the-back super PAC lying down. Tea Party activist Erick Erickson says, 'I dare say any candidate who gets this group's support should be targeted for destruction by the conservative movement.' That's right, Karl. You cross the Tea Party and you could end up like the last candidate they targeted for destruction - Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made his fifth State of the Union Address tonight in Washington, DC. ... His focus was on jobs and the economy. He has an interesting plan to grow the economy. He laid it out. This is it. Cash 4 Gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately following the President's speech, Republicans gave their rebuttal, and this is strange. Yesterday, Democrats held a press conference to deliver a pre-rebuttal to the Republicans' rebuttal. Traditionally, immediately following the State of the Union Address, the opposition party rebuts what the President said. They don't know what the President is going to say, but they know they won't like it. But this year, the Democrats decided to preemptively rebut their rebuttal. So they gave a speech, responding to a speech no one had ever heard, which itself was in response to a speech no one had ever heard. Which I think is the plot to 'Inception,' isn't it? So God bless America, we're on the right track.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, President Obama gave his State of the Union Address. There were 25 standing ovations. John McCain got out of his seat - eight times, he got up. He got out of his seat eight times. I mean, seven of them were to go to the bathroom, but that's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Obama wants Congress to increase the minimum wage. And believe me, when it comes to doing the minimum for their wage, Congress knows what it's talking about. That is the place to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A postcard a man sent to his mother in Oklahoma 47 years ago just arrived last Friday. It took 47 years to be delivered. And that was while the post office was still working on Saturdays You know, Lance Armstrong was sponsored by the United States postal system. You know what his punishment should be for all of this? Get more steroids, get on the stupid bicycle, ride 100 miles an hour and make him deliver our mail on Saturdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought the Obama address was very strong, very forceful. He mentioned climate. Good to see that, yup. Mentioned guns. Very good to see that. Talked about money. Climate, guns, money-- by the way, that's my favorite Warren Zevon song.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Smooth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Doctors say you should drink eight glasses of water every speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. I think I look pretty cool drinking out of a tiny bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Laugh all you want, Poland Spring just paid me a million damn dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. This would be a great closer for my ventriloquist act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That looked presidential, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I'm sure they'll edit this part out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. OMG, I asked for sparkling water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Marco Rubio needs his throato lubio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By 2016, won't America want a stooge back in the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys catch Marco Rubio's response to the State of the Union last night? Critics are saying that Rubio had a pretty tough time. At one point, he scratched an itch. Then, he seemed to wipe his mouth, and he actually reached over and took a sip from a tiny bottle of water. It wasn't good. By the end, I was waiting for him to pick his wedgie and butt dial his ex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the State of the Union Address last night, President Obama did an exploding fist bump with Republican Senator Mark Kirk. They did an exploding fist bump. Which really goes to show, you it doesn't matter if they're black or white, Republican or Democrat, politicians are really awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also gave House Speaker John Boehner a thumbs-up before the start of his address. Or as Boehner put it, 'Not the finger I usually get.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama proposed a college scorecard to make the college process easier on families. Not to be confused with my college scorecard, which just says, 'Held hands with a girl senior year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On the SOTU Address] &quot;You were saying something about bridges? Shouldn't you have led with that one? Seventy thousand structurally deficient? Shouldn't you just have opened with that or broke into whatever programming was playing with an urgent message the night you found that out? 'Hey, everybody, this is President Barack Obama. The bridges are death traps!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Fidel Handout here demanded a higher minimum wage, but said nothing about raising the maximum wage. For as long as I can remember, I've been stuck earning more than I can ever need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, 70,000 structurally-deficient death traps [bridges]. On your way to your new minimum-wage job, you want to take the alternate route around the Mississippi River through Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama was just the opening act for the night's main event. The long-awaited Rubio address given by Florida Senator and board-certified minority Marco Rubio. ? No pressure Marco, you are just the egg from which the new Republican Party will be born, so we should put all our egg into one basket and then count our chicken before it hatches and while we're at it, why not make it a hand basket and take it someplace really warm?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made the annual State of the Union Address last night. The President told Congress and the American people that the state of the union is strong. I bet even Lincoln said that when the State of the Union was happening during his era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Florida Senator Marco Rubio rebutted for the GOP, and while the President focused on the middle class and said the rich should pay more taxes, Rubio said you can't have a middle class without the rich. He's right. Without an upper class to not be a part of, how would you even know you were middle class? You might think you were rich. That would screw everything up, so you need rich people to have a middle class. Just like you need biggie fries to have regular sized fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's been five years since the economic meltdown.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two weeks ago, Senators Chuck Grassley and Sherrod Brown accused the banks of not only being too big to fail, but also, 'too big to jail.' Maybe so. But haven't they been punished enough with stinging wordplay like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

Actually, Tiger Woods gave the President some very valuable tips. The most valuable one? Erase all your text messages.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford&quot; is &quot;back, and he's running for Congress. Yeah, his campaign has an ad in which he says, 'None of us go through life without mistakes.' Well, he has a point. Who among us hasn't disappeared while serving as governor to go and see our girlfriend in South America?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A bill before the Nevada assembly would make it illegal for pedestrians to text while crossing highways in that state.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now say the meteor that hit Russia&quot; was &quot;the largest in 100 years - 55 feet long. It weighed 10,000 tons, and destroyed almost as many homes as Countrywide Mortgage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday - the Academy Awards. ... I think I'm going to have to go with Meryl Streep as Lincoln. A lot of people saw 'Lincoln' and liked it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Sunday morning shows over the weekend, like 'Meet the Press', 'Face the Nation,' 'Press the Meat,' anybody see any of those? John McCain was on one of those shows and he said he questioned President Obama's judgment. ... Let me see if I have this straight.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama's got a new hair cut. ... She has kind of shortish bangs on her hair, and she said it's because of a mid-life crisis. I don't know what she's talking about. I'm having a mid-life crisis and I drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Postal Service is launching a clothing line.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The postal service is teaming with a company in Cleveland to put out a line of clothing and accessories called 'Rain, Heat, and Snow.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Joe Biden? Did you see what he's talking about now? He was talking to somebody and he said ? had advised his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, that she should ? everybody should get a shotgun, and if you hear a noise, just go out on your deck and fire off a couple of rounds. And I was thinking, a Vice President with a shotgun. Gosh, what could possibly go wrong? What could possibly go wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news here - there's talk that the White House may fine China for its recent cyber attacks on American companies. The fine could total in the millions of dollars, which is great because we could really use that money to pay back China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to reduce its debt, the postal service is launching its own line of clothing and accessories. Yeah, they come in one-size-embarrasses-all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former senator Pete Domenici, of New Mexico, revealed today that while in office he fathered a child with the daughter of another senator who was a friend of his. Now, are you following me on this? Now, he cheated on his wife with a daughter of another senator, and they had a baby. When did the Senate become 'The Jerry Springer Show'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this part. Domenici is defending himself by saying that he is no better or worse than the next guy. And he's right, 'cause you know who the next guy was? John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the former San Diego mayor, a woman named Maureen O'Connor, told federal prosecutors that she went broke after gambling more than a billion dollars she inherited from her late husband. She gambled away a billion dollars at casinos playing video poker. A billion dollars. But to be fair, at one point, she was up 300 bucks. So I got to give her ? you know, I got to say it wasn't all ? it wasn't a total loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Chicago congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. pled guilty today to misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign funds for his own personal use, including buying a $43,000 Rolex watch. How ironic is that? All that money on a watch - now he's going to wind up doing time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, you know if you watch this show, if you read the news, if you know what is going on in America, there's no denying that Barack Obama has been a failed president. As terrible as President Obama has been, his cabinet appointments have been worse. I mean, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood? Why? Because his name's got a car part in it? That's a low standard. What is next? Secretary of the Treasury Penny McNickel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he wants the new defense secretary to be former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel. Thankfully, today 15 Republican senators demanded the withdrawal of Hagel's nomination, and it's no wonder. Senate Republicans have found all sorts of shady associations in Hagel's past. For instance, he was once a Senate Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, according to conservative news aggregator Breitbart.com, Hagel may have taken money from an organization called 'Friends of Hamas.' 'Friends of Hamas'? That is serious! Being friends with a Muslim terrorist is a big commitment. You've got to be a groomsman in all four of their weddings. I mean, the suicide vest rentals alone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Friends of Hamas' is even worse than it sounds because this organization is so sinister that it doesn't even exist. Turns out, Hagel's link with 'Friends of Hamas' goes back to [New York] Daily News reporter Dan Friedman, who asked a Republican Senate aide looking for dirt in Hagel's past if Hagel had given a speech to the Junior League of Hezbollah or the 'Friends of Hamas,' assuming that no one could take seriously the idea that organizations with those names existed. Why wouldn't you take it seriously? I mean, if there's no Junior League of Hezbollah, who puts out the cookbook of bomb recipes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, the fact that these organizations don't exist only makes it more suspicious that Chuck Hagel has been tied to them. What else is he hiding that hasn't happened? Is he a member of the Al Qaeda Kidz Club? What about the Muslim Brotherhood? Or the Muslim Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants? And what about non-Islamic, non-existent groups? Has Chuck Hagel ever given a speech to Cobra? Or for that matter, Cobra Kai? Has he received donations from the Lollipop Guild? What are his ties to the Dead Poet's Society? And why are they dead? Did they know too much about Benghazi?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama you must withdraw Hagel's nomination or you will lose the support of moderate Republicans. Another group that doesn't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been discussing this week on the program how Republicans led by Senators Lindsey DuGraham and Salty McCain are holding up the nominees for the defense and CIA until the senators get the information on what happened in Benghazi, including who changed the talking points Susan Rice used on the Sunday morning shows, so we can be sure going forward that no Americans are harmed again by the talking points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Pakistan are complaining that the movie 'Zero Dark Thirty' contains a lot of errors about the country. They were like, 'The movie makes Pakistan out to be a hellish wasteland of corruption and intolerance, but in real life it is way worse than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Gallup poll, 70% believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. The other 30% are so disillusioned, they're thinking about moving back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the US Postal Service has announced they're going to be selling their own line of post office clothing. Postal clothing. It's for people who always want to arrive late and not work on Saturdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month, Mitt Romney will be making his first public speech after losing the election. ... His topic will be rebuilding your life with just a hope, a dream, and $230 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think a fashion line is a bad idea, but I think if the post office gets behind something, it'll eventually turn out to be a good idea. Just look at sponsoring Lance Armstrong, for example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the postal service clothing line is going to be called 'Rain, Heat and Snow.' That's also the name of my Earth, Wind and Fire cover band.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You people in the rest of the country, gasoline in parts of California, five bucks a gallon.

Gas is so expensive, Jesse Jackson, Jr., can only afford to buy Tito Jackson memorabilia. The price of gas is so high, Lindsay Lohan is now forced to choose between drinking or driving.

I can't tell you how many times I rounded up the family and the dog and headed for the bunker. ? Now, we're being sequestered. Sequestering. Anybody ever heard of that term in that context? I have no idea what it means. The budget goes into effect on Friday, which means it will affect - oh, that's it, airport security. Airport security. They're cutting back on airport security. What has kept us safe? Airport security. What are they cutting back on? Airport security. I mean, now we have to go back to patting ourselves down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night the Oscars took top achievement in chapping my hide. Last night there were hit and misses on the red carpet. ? As for the awards themselves, I don't know what to say. .. When it came time for the Best Picture, the big award, was it presented by a movie star? No - it was presented by First Lady Michelle Obama, followed by a pile of wrinkled laundry. Oh, and did Mrs. Obama give it to the most American movie, 'Zero Dark Thirty'? No. Wouldn't want to honor the movie that killed bin Laden. Her husband has to get all the credit for that. We all know Hollywood doesn't reward torture films, because if they did, the winner would have been 'Battleship.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just beginning. Next summer, the movie will be Harry Reid driving the speed limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the media, a smoking gun is always a smoking gun. Some journalists are so prejudiced against guns they've sunk to journalism. Because there's no national database of shootings, Slate has started tallying the number of gun deaths since Newtown. It's been more than 30 a day. I know that number sounds high, but there's only 28 days in February, remember. Sadly, all this anti-gun information has had an effect: In a recent poll, 93% of Americans favor background checks. We can't trust those 93%. We don't know their background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't the first time our Second Amendment rights have been threatened by fact. In 1993, the jack-booted statisticians at the Centers for Disease Control published a study of gun households. Now, according to the study, not only were guns ineffective in home protection, but people who kept guns in their homes appeared to be at greatest risk of homicide than people who do not. Sure, with a gun in my house my family is less safe, but isn't that a small price to pay for my family's safety?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Team Obama's former National Field Director Jeremy Bird, one of the masterminds behind the President's reelection victory, has decided his next job will be turning Texas blue with a new grassroots organization - Battleground Texas. ? Nation, this means the Democrats are messing with Texas! A) I believe that's unconstitutional, and B), I believe it might work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in New Jersey was arrested after police allegedly found 100 bags of heroin in his - anyone want to guess? Hat? No. Fanny pack? Getting warmer. They found 100 bags of heroin in his butt. That's right, they pulled a guy over for a routine traffic stop. He had some outstanding traffic warrants. So they took him to the station and that's when he found out he was a human pi?ata. So they took one down and passed it around. And there were 99 bags of heroin. And so on. He was charged with possession of heroin with intent to sell and tampering with evidence. I say if you have 100 bags of anything in your butt, you should be allowed to keep it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first, after the election, there was the fiscal cliff. Do you remember the fiscal cliff? They tried to scare the crap out of us about the fiscal cliff, didn't they? Did anybody here understand what the fiscal cliff was? That goes away, what was next? The debt ceiling. Oh, my God! The debt ceiling. Is the debt ceiling worse than the fiscal cliff? Yes, much worse. Okay, that went away, and now sequesters. Sequesters. Any idea what those are? Who was the star of 'Rocky?' Sequester Stallone. That's as close as I can come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I know is this means a lot of government cuts. For example ? and I won't bore you with all of them - but for example, let's just say you're a member of the Supreme Court. And you decide to retire and you want to keep the robe. $75 bucks. $75 bucks. That's what'll happen.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel. Congratulations to Chuck Hagel, new Secretary of Defense. And today, already off to a bad start. He's going to bring all of the troops home from Afghanistan, but they're coming on a Carnival cruise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In today's vote in Italy, not a single party won the majority. So, Italy's next prime minister will either be Silvio Berlusconi, who's the Italian Bill Clinton,&quot; and &quot;then there's a communist and then there's a stand-up comedian. It sounds like a set-up to a joke. Italian Bill Clinton and a comedian and a communist walk into a bar. And the bartender says 'Hey, it's Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I think would be a great prime minister of the US? Yakov Smirnoff. But Craig, you say, Yakov Smirnoff wasn't born in America. Didn't stop Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, we're still fighting the war on terror,&quot; and &quot;the war on terror just turned 12 years old, which explains why it's so into remote-controlled planes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my favorite thing about our endless, borderless war against an emotional state is our prison at Guantanamo Bay. Even though many have wanted to see Gitmo closed, including President Obama, despite all logic, it remains open for business. It's the Radio Shack of the war on terror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you follow the news closely, you are probably unaware that Gitmo is currently hosting the trial of 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. ... Now, one reason you may not have heard about it, is that not the easiest trial to cover. First, because it's not really a trial. It's a one-of-a-kind military tribunal designed by President Bush, implemented by President Obama, and inspired by President Kafka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, reporters are not allowed in the courtroom. They have to watch the trial from behind 'soundproofed glass and hear the proceedings on a 40-second delay.' And to protect national security, the judge, or a security officer in the courtroom, can hit a mute button which shuts off the audio to the reporters and indicates this by making a red light on the judge's bench spin. The red light also indicates that all dress shirts and men's slacks are 20% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on January 29th, the red light turned on and cut the audio, but ? and this is the fun part ? neither the judge, nor the security officer had done it, causing the livid and confused judge to say, quote, 'Note for the record, that the 40-second delay was initiated not by me. If some external body is turning things off, if someone is turning the commissions off under their own view of what things ought to be, with no reason or explanation, then we are going to have a little meeting about who turns that light on or off.' And while you're at it, find out who put the dimmer switch on habeas corpus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the government's prosecutor said she could explain who was doing it, but not in open session. ... Well, whoever's doing it, it's got the defense lawyers worried that someone might be listening to private communications between them and their clients at the defense table. C'mon, I realize these military tribunals are a little unconventional, in that they may not be covered under the Geneva conventions, but it's paranoid to imagine that the government is eavesdropping on you at the defense table. They're eavesdropping on your attorney-client meeting rooms. Hey, they say justice is blind, but they never said she's deaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, so the whole thing's being spied on and controlled by unseen forces. Big deal. It's just like 'Survivor,' except in this case, no one gets voted off the island. But folks, I can understand that for many this trial has lost its legitimacy. So, I say we do the ethical thing and let the detainees go free. Then hunt them down with unaccountable flying death bots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this month John Kerry was sworn in as Secretary of State, an announcement that was met with a resounding, 'Yeah, okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Sunday, he embarked on a ten-day, nine-nation marathon that I was surprised to see did not include his homeland of Easter Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not good, you guys. Americans are bracing for this thing called the sequester. ? It's like when $85 billion will be cut from almost every part of the budget. So, teachers, meat inspectors and TSA workers will all be affected. So, if you're someone who teaches people how to keep bad meat off airplanes, you're really screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington is still going on and on about this whole sequester thing. If you're not sure what it all means, maybe this could explain it to you. Picture America as a giant Carnival cruise ship. The captain is fighting with the crew about who to throw overboard. The rest of us are up to our eyeballs in crap. Okay, does that explain it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the politicians don't understand what's going on. Like today, they asked Governor Rick Perry what he thought of the sequester. And he said, 'I think Ryan is a great host on 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said this week after four years as president, you realize all the mistakes you have made. So, apparently he does watch Fox News. Yeah, I guess he does. Yeah, because they keep pointing them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big international controversy about the Oscars. When they aired them in Iran, the Iranian government digitally added sleeves to Michelle Obama's gown. They also altered the video so that Jennifer Lawrence is now deliberately tripped by the Israelis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At &quot;midnight tonight a ticking time bomb goes off in Washington, and for once I'm not confusing real life with an episode of 'Homeland.' The horrific scenario awaiting us is sequestration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama &quot;is trying to convince us the sequester is a terrible problem, when, in fact, it's a terrible solution. You see, it was born back in 2011 when Obama wanted to raise the debt ceiling, the amount that America can borrow to pay its bills. It's sort of like raising the credit limit on your Visa to pay off your MasterCard if you had used your MasterCard to pay for two trillion-dollar wars. They were worth it, because now we can use all the free miles to go to the next war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Republicans would only raise the debt ceiling if the President promised later spending cuts. If those were not passed by an arbitrary date, it would trigger the sequester, a doomsday scenario designed to cripple programs that both sides love. The Democrats would see damaging reductions in education, national parks, vaccination programs, food inspection, even the National Zoo, while Republicans would see cuts to everything they hold dear, like the military?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the two sides failed to come to a compromise...March, 2013, would come in like a lion and go out like a lion loose from the unguarded National Zoo. It was a good plan, as long as one of the sides didn't forget that it was a horrible plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, in retrospect, we should have seen this sequester failure coming. It's just like the story from the Bible: 'And lo King Salomon said, &quot;If I cannot agree whose baby this is, I shall cut it in half.&quot; And one of the mom's said, &quot;Great, half a baby. Probably less work anyway, if you get the top half. No diaper changes.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But folks, I think I know why the sequester is not working, because it doesn't affect Congress. The salaries of senators and representatives do not get cut. So, to Congress, the sequester is like a loan shark saying that if you don't pay up, he's going to break your neighbor's legs. No skin off their nose. Also, he'll be taking your neighbor's nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that doesn't mean the sequester itself was a bad idea. Remember, the government that governs best is one that forces itself to either make tough decisions or suffer unimaginably horrible consequences. I believe it was Jefferson who said that, or Jigsaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, to prevent the next crisis, we just need a worst scenario. I say we suspend a monkey above the floor of Congress. No, an Ebola monkey. Then, every senator in Congress...gets smeared with bananas and a meat. If they do not reach a budget deal by the deadline, the doors to Congress are locked, the rope is cut and it is meal time in the monkey house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Senate confirmed Jack Lew to be President Obama's new Treasury Secretary. Unfortunately, if the sequester happens, he'll have to be let go due to budget cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, with automatic spending cuts scheduled for tomorrow, 300 illegal immigrants have been released from jail in Arizona. Or as officials put it, 'Catch you later.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Senate failed to pass both Republican and Democratic alternatives to head off these across-the-board spending cuts. It was pretty scary, you know? I mean, for a second there, Congress was dangerously close to actually getting something done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome sequestration survivors. As you know, Congress did not reach an agreement. And Congresswoman Maxine Waters said today that 170 million jobs could be lost because of it. Now, there are only 155 million workers in America. Yet, she says we'll lose 170 million jobs - are you beginning to understand why we're in this situation in the first place now? Is it starting to become clear why everything isn't quite well?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, the cuts have already begun. Just yesterday, the Pope got laid off. ... Of course, at this point, we have no idea who the next Pope will be. How about Mitt Romney? He's not doing anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Rodman's in North Korea right now. And here's how isolated and screwed up North Korea is: They think he's President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My local gas station has a new slogan ? 'Give me your cash and nobody gets hurt.' ... Gas prices are rising faster than Jack Nicholson's eyebrows at a Jennifer Lawrence movie. Gas is so expensive, I wanted to pay by credit card, and he asked me for a co-signer. Gas is so expensive, today I saw Bill O'Reilly carpooling with Bill Maher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later this month, a 106-year-old Ohio woman will get her high school diploma. And on the advice of her guidance counselor, she's going to attend a two-year college. I think that's good. I would go with the two-year program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;in the same interview, Ann Romney blamed the media for her husband Mitt Romney's defeat. ... Her quote is, 'It's not fair. They kept reporting exactly what he said.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Kenya is holding elections for the first time since 2007. Getting nasty though - each presidential candidate is accusing the others of being born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sequester is here. The arbitrary budget cuts that were so onerous Congress would never allow the sequester to take effect. Remember? ? But it still happened. Because Congress, as always in its infinite wisdom, forgot how [bleep] incompetent they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's mess-up was he confused the Star Wars Jedi mind trick with the Star Trek Vulcan mind meld - two completely different things. John Boehner referred to taxation as theft, which shows that he lacks understanding of the Constitution. ... I wonder which gets more attention?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, the sequester amounts to catching your kid smoking and forcing him to smoke a whole carton of cigarettes - only your kid is Denis Leary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, the dreaded 2% across-the-board sequestration cuts kicked in last Friday. And I say it's good. It's time to put the government on a diet. And just like a real diet, the best way to lose weight is to take a cheese grater and just shave off 2% everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, forcing Obama to address the national debt is a moral issue. If we don't cut expensive things like Head Start, childhood nutrition programs, teachers, and student loans, what sort of future are we leaving for our children?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we know austerity during economic downturns works. Just look at Europe, if you can see it through the tear gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our new ambassador to North Korea, Dennis Rodman&quot; is &quot;back home safely after visiting the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. ? And apparently they hit it off. Rodman called him 'a friend for life,' although he said the same thing when he married Carmen Electra. And he said that Kim Jong Un said he wants President Obama to call him. ? A lot of people are criticizing Rodman for getting friendly with a guy who said he wants to destroy the United States. I think we should use their friendship to our advantage. I think we should crazy glue Dennis Rodman to the Washington Monument and dare them to bomb us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It took Wall Street five-and-a-half years to repair the gaping wound they self-inflicted.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch this show, you know there is no greater friend to the state of Israel than yours truly. Certainly a better friend than Barack Obama, who has repeatedly snubbed our ally by refusing to visit. He can't keep putting it off by saying, 'Next year, in Jerusalem' at his annual Passover Seder! And I won't even get into what an insult it was to the Jewish people that the brisket was dry. And now, the greatest insult of all. ? Obama thinks he can wipe out his shameful record of never visiting Israel by visiting Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't fall for it, my chosen brethren, my Heeb-bros. He doesn't get you. This man doesn't get it. Israel is a divided country that feels besieged by terrorists, and whose politics are increasingly dictated by a small, hard-right minority. Obama can't relate to that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you need more proof that the President is no friend of Israel, just do the math: Back in 2007, President Bush supported Israel with $2.3 billion in foreign military aid. This year, President Obama wants to bring that down to just $3.1 billion. I know, it looks like it's going up, but remember, in Hebrew you read charts from right to left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama gave a little talk yesterday about canine fitness. She hosted a web chat to discuss her 'Let's Move!' initiative, and one of the parents on the web chat asked if dogs should be involved in the family fitness regimen, and she said they should.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're visiting Washington, DC, soon and you're hoping to take a tour of the White House, you might be disappointed. The White House announced that starting this weekend, they're canceling all tours for the foreseeable future because of sequester-related budget cuts, which is really going to cut into Joe Biden's balloon animal business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the budget cuts are forcing cutbacks to Secret Service, which means they don't have enough security to let people in. So, I guess until the sequester is over, you will just have to imagine all the places where President Clinton had sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, before the Voting Rights Act, black people were regularly kept from voting with roadblocks like literacy tests, poll taxes, and 'you must be this white to vote' signs. Now, that law is being challenged in the Supreme Court by Shelby County, Alabama. They argue that the law is unfair, because it applies only to states with histories of racial discrimination: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia - and Alaska, which has a sad history of discriminating against its African-American population, Brian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, the Voting Rights Act is obsolete - it's like an old restraining order. These states are just saying, 'Yes, I used to beat my girlfriend, but I haven't since the restraining order. So we don't need it anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rand Paul has sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder asking just a simple question: Can the President use a drone to take out an American citizen on US soil? And you would think he would get a letter back that'd be like, 'No, way!' Holder writes him back a letter that never directly addresses the question. Kind of, sort of implied that hypothetically, in the right?'Yes, we can do that, probably won't, but yes.' So, Senator Rand Paul, to draw attention to the issue of the execution of executive executions, executed the classical filibuster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't say I agree with Rand Paul about everything, but as issues go, drone oversight is one worth kicking up a fuss for. But Rand Paul's filibuster preventing the Senate from getting anything done on John Brennan's confirmation is really just a distraction from Congress' inability to not get anything done on the sequester. Yes, Congress, where you rarely see so many things going nowhere so noisily, outside of a NASCAR race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those Head Start skeptics are referring to a piece of 2012 Health and Human Services Department study that showed that while kids who went to Head Start did better for the next few years than those who didn't have the program, by third grade, results evened out. Which might leave a normal person to say why don't we take the beneficial Head Start techniques and apply them to the third grade to keep things getting better, as opposed to the counterargument that the benefits of the program only lasts a few years, so [bleep].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if we're going with studies, you could keep reading the same report you're quoting from and see that other studies have shown that, in general, Head Start programs boost graduation rates, lower crime rates, increased college attendance, income, and they correlate with lower mortality rates for children ages five-to-nine. Oh really, who wants to get to double digits? I mean, your body just goes to hell after nine anyways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A major snowstorm has hit the East Coast. In Washington, DC, everything in the Capitol ground to a halt. And then the snowstorm hit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The budget cuts, that's the big story. Due to the budget cuts, all tours of the White House have been canceled indefinitely. Yeah, when he heard, Joe Biden said, 'Now I'm never [going to] see it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a Harlem shake video. So, once again, just when you think a trend is dead, it's made cool again by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has a new crusade. He wants people to stop listening to loud music in their headphones, which...wasn't that the plot of 'Footloose'? As you may know, over the past few years Bloomberg has banned smoking in public, transfats and sodas larger than 16 ounces in the city of New York. Now, he wants people to stop listening to loud music. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, but the last time I checked, Mike Bloomberg is only a mayor. My headphones are named by a doctor named Dre, and I don't recall asking for a second opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg must throw the worst parties ever. How long before he just starts showing up on street corners and whacking the hot dogs out of people's hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Rodman was in North Korea last week, where he spent some quality time with the supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un - the leader of the country that this morning promised to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against us ? I know this sounds like a bad movie plot, but we might need Donald Trump to fire Dennis Rodman from 'Celebrity Apprentice' so he can save us from obliteration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Rodman's publicist said he wants to go back to North Korea sometime in the next six months and he wants to use his new friendship with Kim Jong Un to help broker peace between the United States and North Korea. Maybe we should let him try it. We already let our smartest people try to work out a peace agreement. Why not let our dumbest person take a crack at it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a great day for the White House. All tours of the White House have been canceled due to budget concerns. ... Don't worry, there's another way get into the White House if you don't belong. Fake your birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, there's a comet. Look at this headline: 'A Comet Making the Closest Approach Ever to Earth.' Now, is it really a comet? Or is it one of President Obama's drones? You're welcome, Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, los Koreans del Norte threatened to end the 60-year cease-fire with South Korea and you know they mean business. They already wiped East and West Korea off the map.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, with tensions rising, America had no choice but to send their top negotiator, Dennis Rodman, for some basketball diplomacy. After all, basketball diplomacy worked at the Yalta Conference. Stalin backed down pretty quick after getting tomahawk-dunked on by FDR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, North Korea is willing to go to any lengths for the world to honor it's demands. ... 'Oh please pay attention to us. I can do a cannon ball, look!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, you know yesterday, Senator Rand Paul embarked on a filibuster to draw attention to the issue of [the] executive branch's seemingly unchecked power to use drones on American soil. The libertarian senator spoke for 12 hours, fortified only by the occasional nougat-filled government handout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, this is nice, he took a group of Republicans for dinner at a restaurant last night. And at the end of the meal, the President personally picked up the tab. ... Afterwards, Republicans said, 'Typical Democrat - spend, spend, spend.' What is wrong with them? He picked up the tab. Took them to a nice Chinese restaurant. I actually don't know what kind of restaurant they went to. ... I thought it was Chinese, because we owe all the money to them. It's a way to make it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea has threatened to nuke the United States. ... Which begs the question, what the hell did Dennis Rodman say over there? Seriously. I don't know what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Venezuela, they held the funeral for dictator Hugo Chavez. Many world leaders were there. Iran sent their president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Cuba sent Raoul Castro. We sent Dennis Rodman. So, it worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that Hugo Chavez is gone, of course, the crazy, nut-ball dictator-void will be filled by North Korea's Kim Jong Un. So, it's nice of him to step in and fill that. We appreciate that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's half brother, Malik Obama, is running for governor in Kenya. And unfortunately, his political opponents are now spreading the rumor that he was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new poll indicates that President Obama is no better than George Bush at protecting civil liberties. In fact, the pollster had some follow-up questions, but split when he saw the drone fly overhead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has nominated Wal-Mart Foundation president Sylvia Matthews Burwell to be his next budget director. And she's a good fit, 'cause Wal-Mart is also heavily dependent on China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge has overturned New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ban on large sugary drinks. Well, that's great, isn't it? I mean, our government can't come to agreement on the sequestration, but when it comes to real issues like our soda, the rulings are swift and decisive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, when it comes to this whole stupid sequestration thing, Mayor Bloomberg told people not to panic. He said, 'We're not going to run out of money.' You know, I'm no financial expert, but when you're $16.5 trillion in debt, haven't you already run out of money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas here in California is just about $5 a gallon. Unbelievable. In fact, oil company executives are now considered so evil that Dennis Rodman won't even have dinner with them. Gas is so expensive, Rachel Maddow is now carpooling with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did anybody have to go through airport security to get here? I like it when they frisk you. I'll be honest. When they pat you down and - are you like - do you have such a fragile ego that if you weren't patted down you would take it personally? ? Well, anyway, now you can...take pocket knives on commercial flights. Pocket knives on commercial airlines. What could possibly go wrong? What could possibly go wrong? If you're like me - I like to spend a lot of free time at the airport whittling. And you can also take pool cues on commercial flights. So pocket knives and pool cues. This is great news if you're a knife-wielding pool hustler. You're back in business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite all of the talk about budget cuts, I read today the Obama's dog, Bo, still travels with his own motorcade. Yeah. After hearing this, Vice President Joe Biden said, 'Wait, why am I still taking the train?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the tours of the White House were canceled? Did you hear that? After tours of the White House were canceled due to budget cuts, Donald Trump offered to pay for them. Yeah. All he's asking is they rename it the 'Trump White House and Casino' - and gold plate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's half-brother ran for political office in Kenya, lost, and has claimed electoral fraud. ... Or as Fox News abbreviated the story, 'Obama: Kenya Fraud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists believe they're on the verge of coming up with a new drug that could help people live to be 150. Yeah. No, it's perfect for anyone who ever reached 100 years old and said 'Please, 50 more years of this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

He passed away, and the Venezuelan government was talking about embalming Hugo and putting him on display. ... But they decided they would not put Hugo Chavez on display.

It turns out the actor playing Satan bears an uncanny resemblance to President Obama. This is real. ? And I think it might be deliberate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what is a big hit now on the History Channel?&quot; The &quot;miniseries called, 'The Bible.' It's based on a book.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The History Channel's mini series, 'The Bible,' is facing criticism because the actor who plays Satan looks a lot like President Obama. ? Even Rush Limbaugh was outraged. He was like, 'How can you do that to Satan?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the United States Senate is now fighting to keep open the Senate barber shop. ... It's losing $350,000 a year. You know what that makes it? The most successful government program ever. Well, the senators are fighting for it. They say they need their own barber shop because of the unusual hours they work. And believe me, any hours they work, that's unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The island nation of Cyprus is now considering a 10% tax on every individual savings account in that country. They will take 10% of your money right out of the bank. ... To which President Obama said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Department of Agriculture wants to use our tax money to buy 400,000 tons of sugar to limit supply and boost prices so sugar producers can pay back government loans that they could default on. ... We loaned them money, and now we're giving them more money so they can pay back our loan. You still wonder why we're $16 trillion in debt? Anybody? Any questions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Party has released a 98-page self-critical white paper detailing how it can improve its image. Hey, here's an idea. Don't call it a white paper, okay? After conducting an internal review, the Republican Party has determined their leadership is too old, too out of touch, and too white. These findings were confirmed by 71-year old Mitch McConnell and 76-year old John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big controversy with the History Channel's miniseries, 'The Bible.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans got together and said, 'We lost the presidential election. I wonder if there's something wrong with us?' And so they commissioned a report, and the report - 100 pages long this report - about what happened, and the facts came back that the Republican Party is perceived as being rich, stuffy, old, white guys. One Republican read the report and was so stunned he dropped caviar on his spats! They were talking to John McCain about the report and he said...'Get off of my lawn!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's what happened. The Republicans lost the presidential election. The Republicans thought they were going to win the election and now they're just being cry babies. So, finally someone said let's get a study, let's spend a couple million dollars on a study and we'll find out ? because we don't think it's us ? but let's find out what the problem was and why we lost the election. So, they get a study back. A hundred pages, and the summary of the hundred pages, why, the people think the Republicans are old white guys. It took them a hundred pages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a NASA official told Congress that if a meteor was on track to strike the US, Americans should pray. Even Pope Francis was like, 'That's your plan 'A'?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is now in Israel. It is his first trip to Israel as president. He did not bring along Joe Biden. I guess he figured the Jews have suffered enough. You know, why put them through that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

Which makes sense, because old people are always talking about their joints and I just never understood why.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was proposed this week that members of Congress use video conferencing and other remote technology to work from their home state instead of Washington. They figure they can get just as much not done at home as they get not done in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coney Island, a century-old amusement park has reopened. It was damaged horribly during the hurricane and is now reopening. ... If the you're like me, you can't wait to get out there and ride a roller coaster that was built in 1912! Congress OK'd $2 billion in emergency cotton candy, so they are ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Passover to everybody celebrating Passover. They had the annual Passover observation down in Washington at the White House, and as always, the President pardoned a brisket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a lottery-jackpot winner, a man from New Jersey, won $330 million, and congratulations to that man and his family. ... The odds of winning that thing - 175 million-to-one. Yup, it's just about the same odds that the Republicans have for getting the White House back in 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me begin by saying Happy Passover, if there's anyone here who is of the Jewish faith. Last night...President Obama celebrated Passover by hosting a Seder at the White House. There was an awkward moment when Sasha asked, 'Hey, I thought we were Muslim?' That didn't go over well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's still talking about March Madness, and it turns out that President Obama has correctly predicted 11 of the Sweet 16 teams. When Joe Biden was asked about his Sweet 16, he said, 'It was great. I had a petting zoo and a clown.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, members of the House and Senate are away from Washington for spring break. You can tell, because people on the beach were like, 'Whoo! Don't take it off!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, members of Congress are really letting loose on spring break. In fact, let's take a look at some of their tweets. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, 'I believe marriage is between one man and one margarita.' #notachoice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll talk about the Republican Party. With a difficult election loss behind them, there's a time of reflection and soul-searching for the GOP. We'll let you know if they find one!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 100-page report to reassure Republicans they don't need to change what they are saying, but how they are saying it. 'Remember, when you tell a gay person that their love is too unnatural for society to recognize - smile.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big issue for 2012 was to connect with minorities. Please welcome GOP 2.0, relatable style. ? After pretending minorities didn't exist, the Republican Party has decided to physically go into the areas and engage person-to-person, or as that is known on the streets, talking. ? They will go to minority neighborhoods, conduct market research and take people back to the minority communities with a re-targeted message. It works for Kool Cigarettes. Why not for another organization that has seemed indifferent to the overall health of minorities?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I don't need to tell you that the Republican Party is in crisis. And ever since they lost the election, the GOP has been flailing around for answers. And no one has flailed harder than Republican National Committee Chairman and unsolved jumble puzzle, Reince Priebus. Crisp bee urine. Look it up. ... Right after the election, Mr. Urine convened a panel of Republican leaders called the 'Growth and Opportunity Project' to study why they lost. Or, as he put it,... a full 'autopsy.' It's the natural thing to do when you've got candidates this cold and stiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the autopsy says that Republicans need to do a better job of reaching out to black people, brown people, and women people, no group is more important to the GOP's future success than young-people people. As the report laments, Mitt Romney lost voters younger than 30 by five million votes. Five million! What were my fellow under-30-year olds thinking? ? The autopsy says that to reach the kids, the GOP should establish a Republican celebrity task force, an elite squad of conservative superstars ready to deploy as soon as we activate the celebrity task force signal. GOP celebrity task force assemble! Jon Voight! Victoria Jackson! Tom Selleck! Kelsey Grammer! Cliff Claven! Lady from 'Northern Exposure,' At least one Baldwin! The kids won't know what hit them, because I'm not sure they know who these people are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama appointed the first female director of the Secret Service. ? This marks the first time a woman has been in charge in almost 150 years of its existence. So in other words, 'Sorry Colombian prostitutes. Bring us the tab; we're going to have to close out our account.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the second day on which the Supreme Court heard arguments for and against same-sex marriage, commonly referred to as gay marriage, which is commonly referred to as the magic of Siegfried and Roy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The constitutionality of marriage act defines marriage as a union between one man and one impossible woman. I hope they legalize gay marriage, because mostly I need to be alive when 'Gay Divorce Court' hits the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year at Easter, Governor Chris Christie was rushed to the hospital. It was an emergency. It turned out he had an impacted peep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the sequestering, they're not having the kids' Easter egg hunt on the White House lawn. ... Last year ? and maybe this is a factor, I don't know, I'm just saying - last year there was some trouble at the Easter egg hunt,&quot; when &quot;one kid found ? he's out looking for egg - he turns up Obama's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?if Bill O'Reilly is now pro-gay marriage, and isn't a flip-flopper like Bill Clinton, then back when he said gay marriage was like marrying a goat, he was really telling us that he's pro-goat marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The VA's got a backlog of 900,000 people. McDonalds handles ten times that many customers in an hour and, may I remind you, they're run by a clown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just announced that George W. Bush's presidential library will be ready to open on May 1st. The library contains items from the former president's life, including pictures and memorabilia, or as Bush put it, 'best of all, no books.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big day at the White House when President Obama named the first woman to be the director of the Secret Service today. Experts are calling the move an important part of history ? sorry, I meant her-story. You could tell she's good, because one official was like, 'I've never seen a female Secret Service agent before.' And she was like, 'Exactly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech yesterday, former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for having an affair with his biographer. He said he hopes this begins a new chapter in his life. Although, it got awkward when he was like, 'Any of you ladies want to write it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Texas Governor Rick Perry made it clear that he is against same-sex marriage. He said the issue is not debatable. And if it was, he'd lose, because he loses every debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legendary singer Dionne Warwick filled for bankruptcy, claiming she has only $25,000 in assets but owes more than $10 million in unpaid taxes. She owes 400 times what she has. You know where she can end up? Serving three years as the White House budget director.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is under investigation for alleged misuse of campaign funds, and she's blaming the accusation on her arch-nemesis: the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the University of Southern California...the former general and CIA director David Petraeus made his first public speech since resigning in November over that extra-marital affair. It was his first appearance since November, if you don't count that episode of 'Cheaters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Mexico Representative Steve Pearce is proposing a rule change that would allow lawmakers to telecommute to Washington and pass laws without meeting face to face. ... It would be a virtual Congress, where the House of Representatives would be able to video conference from home. The breakthrough? This would allow congressmen to vote on laws while actually being in bed with the lobbyists at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And commenting on Prince Harry's upcoming visit to his state, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he will spend the entire day with Prince Harry, and he's going to make sure nobody gets naked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton now says he wishes he had supported gay marriage back when he was president. ... Clinton said at the time he was too busy campaigning for open marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll came out - shows that 64% of New Jersey residents don't care about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight. That's mostly because Chris Christie is 64% of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano ? the person in charge of our national security ? she recently said she doesn't email, text or tweet. So remember, if you see something, say something?because there's literally no other way she'll get the message. So, if there's a pressing national emergency ? if there's an emergency, don't worry. She'll be aware of it in three-to-five business days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced that people dressed up like Scooby-Doo, SpongeBob and Dora The Explorer will be at Monday's Easter egg roll. Or as Biden put it, 'What do you mean, people dressed up like?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea is warning the US that war with South Korea may break out at any minute. And then Obama was like, 'I can't believe I'm doing this. Get me Dennis Rodman on the phone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, yesterday he told reporters that his NCAA tournament bracket is busted. Yeah, Obama said they were the worst picks he's ever made. Then he looked at his economic adviser and said, 'Eh, maybe not.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Ashley Judd announced she will not be running for Senate in Kentucky against Mitch McConnell. And Mitch McConnell announced he will not be co-starring in any romantic comedies with Matthew McConaughey. ... So it all worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea now threatening the United States with all-out war. You can see they're stepping it up. In fact, they released ten more photos of Kim Jong-Un looking through binoculars. Do you know the city of Los Angeles is apparently one of Korea's top targets?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of North Korea, they are isolated. They are so isolated, they just sent a wedding present to Larry King and his first wife. That's how isolated they are. They are so isolated, their Olive Garden has limited breadsticks, okay? They are so isolated, they're hoping this year Wilt Chamberlain will lead the Lakers to victory.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, when you're the President and you're living in the White House something always goes wrong. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Florida Senator Marco Rubio? He's now saying that he supports immigration law&quot; reform. &quot;To have this guy in that position is important. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is getting ready to unveil his new budget nine weeks after its original due date. Or as his dog Bo put it, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. I ate the first draft. I know the drill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, a group of priests, ministers and rabbis are calling on President Obama to stop the White House drone program. The priests, ministers and rabbis weren't planning on working together, but they happened to walk into the same bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, every day more and more freeloaders are sucking at the government teat. Which is especially troubling since Uncle Sam is a dude. That's not even counting Obamacare, which takes effect in less than eight months. Do you realize what this means? If you go to the emergency room now, you'll be covered by the time you finally see a doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare raises eligibility for Medicaid to 133% of the poverty line, allowing it to cover 30 million more Americans by 2022. Thirty million medical moochers. To put that in perspective, if you laid them all end-to-end, they would stretch to Canada, which is where they should move if they want free healthcare!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Republicans have done their part. They have voted to repeal Obamacare 39 times. One more and they get free healthcare for life. Just kidding. They get that now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's Obama's trap. The feds are picking up 100% of the cost of each state's Medicaid expansion until 2017. But then, over the next four years, the percentage the feds pay plunges all the way down to 90% By then, your state is hooked like a diabetic jonesing for his insulin fix. ... Luckily, Republican governors aren't falling for it, like Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam. Under Obamacare, 180,000 people from Tennessee would be added to his state's Medicaid or Tenncare program, but Haslam said no, explaining, 'A lot of people say, &quot;Hey, that's an easy call. Just expand three years 100% and then walk away at that point in time.&quot; I don't think you can easily walk away.' No. Do you know how heartbreaking it is to tell someone they're no longer getting healthcare? It's so much kinder to just tell them they're never getting healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, the governor is confident that Tennessee can go it alone, because Tennessee already has a great plan for getting affordable healthcare to the those who need it: A healthcare lottery. Twice a year, residents who have high medical bills and who wouldn't be eligible for Tenncare can call a state phone line and request an application, but they need to do it quick, because the line shuts down after 2,500 calls - typically within an hour. Yes, for one hour, twice a year, a few lucky people are allowed to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, since the line is only open for an hour, would-be applicants are encouraged to use multiple phones, and to dial and dial and dial. Yes, keep calling! And if you do get through, make sure you shout 'Tennessee Tenncare has all the healthcare hits!' And you'll win two tickets to see your dermatologist live at the Bourbon Blues and Boogie Bar! Nation, I love this healthcare lottery. It finally adds some suspense to that old, boring question: 'Will I see tomorrow?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House held their 135th annual Easter Egg Roll. It sounds like fun if there are no fun things to do. President Obama and Mrs. Obama were there to make sure none of the kids got candy. The theme was 'Be healthy, be active, be you.' That's the problem. There is nothing healthy or active about me. But that was the theme. They had a yoga garden, which sounds like a place you threaten kids with when they are bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States sent a Navy destroyer toward North Korea as Kim Jong-Un threatens to strike America. And today, even China stepped in. China warned Kim Jong-Un. They've told him flat out, 'Hey, those missiles, they better not hit any Wal-Marts or you are in trouble, buddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top Iranian official has announced that 2013 will be the fall of the American empire. Let me tell you something, okay? If you're going to criticize America, if you're going to attack our government, if you're going to think the end is near, you just get a job on Fox News like everybody else, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of a bold, new initiative, today, President Obama asked Congress for $100 million to map the human brain. And believe me, believe me, if anybody needs a map to find their brain, it's Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a groundbreaking move, the Associated Press, the largest news gathering outlet in the world, will no longer use the term 'illegal immigrant.' ... They will now use the phrase 'undocumented Democrat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty shocking. Stockton, California has become the most populous city in the nation to enter bankruptcy. ... In fact, they are so broke, I saw a 'Going Out of Business' sign on a meth lab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A priest in Connecticut is pleading guilty this week to the selling and manufacturing of $300,000 worth of methamphetamine. And the church is dishing out its severest punishment. They're going to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they did yesterday in - and I think this was privately funded so don't get excited about them spending our tax money. They had the big annual White House Easter Egg Roll where kids come and horse around on the White House lawn and have Easter eggs and stuff. And once again this year-- like every year-- the whole thing was won by a kid from Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's crazy, but I love him? Kim Jong-Un. ... He's the son of Kim Jong-Il and he's the evil North Korean dictator, but gosh I get a kick out of the guy. He's now vowing to destroy America - Kim Jong-Un says he will destroy America. In response to that, we heard from his publicist, Howard Rubinstein. He says we shouldn't take it seriously - Kim Jong-Un is just dehydrated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama shot baskets at the White House and only made two shots out of 22. Even Dick Cheney was like, 'That guy needs to learn to shoot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Obama went only 2-for-22. It is tough times for Obama. One minute he is asking Congress to raise the debt ceiling, the next day he's asking them to lower the hoop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was sweet. Yesterday at the White House Easter Egg Roll, President Obama comforted a five-year-old boy who started crying. Some critics are claiming the moment was staged, mainly because the kid was like [ sobbing ], 'I just don't understand why John Boehner won't pass your budget!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After North Korea announced that it will restart a nuclear reactor, the US Navy is sending a warship closer to North Korea. And if that doesn't get their attention, they're going to send a Carnival Cruise ship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these are dark times for opponents of same-sex marriage. Not only is it an abomination against God's law, but I never get invited. ? Last week the Supreme Court heard arguments in two different gay marriage cases, which they won't rule on until June. Wedding season! ... If they rule in favor of gay marriage, they will be ignoring sound legal arguments against it. Like 'Eww.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Georgia GOP chairwoman Sue Everhart recently told the 'Marietta Daily Journal' that, quote, 'Lord, I'm going to get in trouble over this, but it is not natural for two women or two men to be married. If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship.' So, if they can't have a sexual relationship, what's it really all about? Everhart knows it's not about marriage. It's not about gay rights. It's not even about gay people. This is about heterosexual fraud. She says, 'You may be as straight as an arrow, and you may have a friend that is as straight as an arrow. Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you're gay, and y'all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it's all about a free ride.' Yes. A free ride. This entire battle about marriage equality has really been about straight men, trying to get free healthcare. Because if there's one thing I know about straight guys, it's that they will jump at the chance for their peers to think they might be gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairwoman of the Republican Party in Georgia has an interesting new argument against same-sex marriage. Sue Everhart is her name. She believes if same-sex marriage is legalized, straight people will pretend to be gay to get married to get health benefits. She said, 'Say you had a great job with the government where you had this wonderful health plan. What would prevent you from saying that you're gay and you all get married and you get all the benefits?' I don't know? Probably the same thing that would prohibit you from saying you're straight and doing it. The best part of her argument is it actually is the premise of the Adam Sandler-Kevin James movie 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.' Maybe she was led to believe that was a documentary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie signed an unusual new bill into law. It prohibits kids under 17 from tanning beds and under 14 from spray tanning. Now if you're in New Jersey you'll have to vigorously rub up against Snooki.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A percentage of voters think Obama is the antichrist. Public Policy Polling asked a group of 1,200 registered voters. Thirteen percent said they believe Obama is the antichrist and another 13% were not sure. I feel if he were the antichrist, he would be getting more legislation passed. But it also seems unlikely that the antichrist would wear mom jeans, right? More anti-Linda than antichrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new scandal here in New York City. Everybody wants to be the mayor, so now there's a political scandal. A guy ? it involves three Democrats and a Republican. So, it's nice to see the two parties working together. A guy tried to buy his way onto the ballot to be nominated, elected mayor, tried to buy his way. Not only that. They also caught him with a 32-ounce soda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have now opened the George W. Bush Library in Texas - a huge gathering, four living ex-presidents were there, and making a special appearance was the un-dead Nixon. Never mind. It was just kind of a silly thought. But at the Bush library, they will have a think tank, and I was thinking, that's [a] pretty shallow, pretty shallow tank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has now put together a website for kids. It's a website for kids to teach kids how to manage a budget responsibly. And the web site is called 'Irony.gov.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, former South Carolina governor and Appalachian hiker with extremely poor sense of direction, Mark Sanford, has secured the Republican nomination. What a stunning comeback. After being unfaithful to his wife and betraying the public trust, he gets a second chance in politics ? only in America and Italy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last election proved that if they're ever gonna win again, the GOP needs to capture the youth vote. Fear not, Republicans are on it. Just this week, they offered youngsters the one thing they simply can't resist: a survey. ... And you know they're not messing around with this survey, because it's hosted by SurveyMonkey.com. America's most trusted simian data-collection service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let me tell you: Some of the questions on this bad boy are totes mad poppin' fresh. Such as numero thirty-sixo, which addresses young voters' love of diversity. Asking, 'Do you think that the Republican Party discriminates against people? If so, which people?,' with options including 'African Americans, white people, Latinos, Asians, gays and lesbians,' or 'the Republican Party does not discriminate against anyone.' That's easy - the answer is the GOP does not discriminate against anyone. Least of all white people, who are the only option the survey refers to as people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But my personal favo-rave is question thirty-eight: 'What is your sexual orientation? Straight, gay, bisexual or in the closet?' Yes, in the closet, because if you're a young person struggling with your sexuality, there's no safer place to come out than on a Republican survey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress recently passed, and President Obama signed, a continuing resolution to fund the government all the way through September. Our government is no longer living month-to-month. We're now living six months-to-six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama will attend the dedication of George W. Bush's presidential library this month. Apparently, there's still a lot of debris around the new building. Or as Obama put it, 'Don't look at me. I'm still cleaning up your last mess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama has now asked Congress for $100 million to spend on a new project to map the human brain. Boy, that's so typical, isn't it? Asking Congress to spend money on something they'll never use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, on the other hand?this could be our only chance of finding out what the hell is in Michele Bachmann's head, so it could be a good balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former president George Bush has invited President Obama to the opening of his presidential library later this month. President Obama is looking forward to going through the library to see if there's anything else he could blame Bush for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean dictator Kim Jong UN has increased security for himself and his wife. Do you know Kim Jong UN's wife is a singer? ... She goes by the name Lil Kim Jong Un.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stockton, California, now in the midst of a huge financial crisis. They are the most populous city in the nation to go bankrupt. ... In fact, Stockton is so broke, getting hit by a North Korean missile would actually increase property value. Stockton is so broke, even Lindsay Lohan refuses to shoplift there. To give you an idea how broke Stockton is ? today, the mayor gave the key to the city to MC Hammer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, North Korea's military announced that it has approved a nuclear strike on the United States. They seem pretty serious. In fact, they started faxing a warning to the White House.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, there are?two Kims in the news. There's Kim Jong Un. He's the leader of North Korea. Then, there's Kim Kardashian?the reality star who's having a baby with Kanye West. And it seems like there's a story about them every day, and it can be kind of tough to keep track of who's who. So, I came up with a few quick and easy ways to help tell them apart. Take a look: Kim Kardashian is expecting a baby. Kim Jong Un looks like a baby. ... Kim Kardashian's life is like a roller-coaster. Kim Jong Un isn't tall enough to ride one. Kim Kardashian's favorite movie is called 'Failure to Launch.' Kim Jong Un's nuclear program is called 'Failure to Launch.' Finally, Kim Kardashian used to date a basketball player. Kim Jong Un currently dates a basketball player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey folks, I got to tell you, the tensions continue to mount in this North Korean situation. It's getting pretty serious. The US has moved a Navy warship off the coast of the Korean peninsula. Is that going to scare the North Koreans? You really want to scare them, don't send a warship, you send a Carnival Cruise ship, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong Un says that war could break out today or tomorrow. Who plans a war like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Commenting on North Korea's threats) &quot;So all week long he has been working that up, Kim Jong Un, first when you hear that you think gosh, I hope he doesn't do that. But then the more you think about it, they're not going to ? I mean North Korea is like a Carnival Cruise for the love of God, you know. They're not going to destroy anybody. They got no electricity, no plumbing. They don't have enough food. They don't have any fresh water. They don't know where they're going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it seems like every day President Obama finds a new way to waste our tax dollars. I mean two daughters? Seems a little redundant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, Obama can't even name stuff right. His mapping initiative goes by the acronym 'BRAIN,' which stands for 'Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neuro-Technologies.' You heard that right ? the B in 'BRAIN' stands for brain. You can't use the acronym in the acronym.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this brain registry is just like the gun registry. I mean, the gun registry is just a plot to take away our guns. The brain registry means Obama's coming for our brains.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a bunch of fast food workers in New York City went on strike today. ... Hundreds of employees from McDonald's, Wendy's and KFC walked off the job this morning. They're demanding the companies double their pay, $15 an hour, and if it doesn't happen, there will be no fast food in New York. Boy, Mayor Bloomberg has got to be torn on this one, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman named Sue Everhart - she is the chairwoman of the Georgia Republican Party.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little strange that the President would say another elected official was the best looking. But it's actually part of his annual Obama superlatives list. The official list came out today and here are some of his others picks - take a look at this. Senator Mitch McConnell was voted most likely to race a hare. House Speaker John Boehner, he was voted most likely to cry during the season finale of 'Girls.' Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew was voted most likely to wear two toupees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately, if you've been watching the television or reading the newspapers, you may have noticed the Federal government, thanks to deadlock-inertia and what many analysts are calling 'fatheadedness,' is not really doing anything when it comes to governing. But the states are picking up the slack. Yes, the meth laboratories of democracy are hard at work tackling all of our nation's most important and pressing issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've got to say, with all the depressing news about possible war with North Korea and the endless debate over gun violence, I just want to lighten the mood a little and talk about the massive oil spill in Mayflower, Arkansas. The historic site where the Mayflower landed. That's not right. The Pilgrims landed at Little Rock, I think. All I know it was definitely Arkansas, because they came over on an ark. You might be asking, 'Stephen why haven't we heard anything about the cleanup of the rupture of the Pegasus pipeline that spilled 150,000 gallons of tar sand oil?' That's because Exxon has contained the cleanup...coverage by threatening to have reporters arrested for trespassing, and at Exxon's request, the FAA ordered a no-fly zone over the area, and everyone is respecting the no-fly zone, especially the birds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US and South Korean officials today say they're highly confident that North Korea will launch a medium-range missile anytime now, which I guess means Dennis Rodman failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The missiles are believed to have a range of about 2,000 miles. No one knows for sure, but they could hit targets in Japan and South Korea for sure, even possibly Hawaii and Guam, which is bad. And yet, why do I feel like this whole thing could be solved by sending Kim Jong Un a Disneyland Park hopper pass?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the ships at sea, nation, I say it all the time. America's military is the baddest...kickingest fighting force in the history of forever! You get in our way and we'll spend 10-15 years taking you down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America now has a laser that can do anything from burn through a fast attack boat to emit a nonlethal burst to dazzle the enemy. That's right. It's the Navy's most dazzling technology since they weaponized Cher. Now, I want the world to know that even though America now possesses laser weapons, it does not mean we're going to turn into an evil empire, although I will say...that we know the Ewoks are aiding the rebels, and I find your lack of faith highly laser-able.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends, I have long warned you about the threats coming from the United Nations - the world's most powerful, completely impotent organization. ... Well, tonight I'm giving a wag of my finger to the UN for going after what we hold more precious than our children: Our guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the UN is trying to convince us that gun control will make us safer. According to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the treaty 'will help to keep warlords, pirates, terrorists and criminals and their like from acquiring deadly arms.' You might think, Stephen, sounds look a good idea, because I don't want evil people to have guns. ... If you wanted to take guns away from all evil people, I suppose you would start with Hitler, right? Pretty bad guy. Well guess what? He shot himself with a gun. If you want to take away his gun, you are really saying you wish Hitler was still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Senate is opening debate tomorrow on a Second Amendment-crushing gun control bill that may not include restrictions on semiautomatics or magazine capacity, but does include background checks and a complete ban on holding your gun sideways because you saw it in a movie once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Kentucky Senator and home-perm cautionary tale Rand Paul promised that he would filibuster this bill. Now the Republicans have cold feet, just because 85% of the gun owners favor universal background checks. Well, of course owners are okay with background checks. They've already got their guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, after months of wrangling, President Obama has unveiled his highly-anticipated 2014 budget. And apparently, neither Democrats nor Republicans are happy with it. And Obama said, 'Yeah, that's how you know it's good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Dick Cheney told house Republicans that the US is in, 'deep doo-doo with North Korea.' Incidentally, 'deep doo-doo' is the color of the shoes I just got at Target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, Congress returned from spring break. See, Congress spring break is a little different from college spring break. In Congress spring break, you screw as many people as you can when you come back from vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has warned North Korea about starting a war. ... China told them flat out, 'Do not fire any missiles at the United States, at least until after we get our money. They owe us $16 trillion, wait until then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, some experts believe that North Korea has a missile that could reach Los Angeles. And, of course, if North Korea did attack Los Angeles, that would, of course, start a war with Mexico. And the whole thing would escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the Wall Street Journal.com, Anthony Wiener ... now thinking about running for mayor of New York City. ... The website said Mr. Wiener did not respond to an email seeking comment. Hey, Anthony Wiener doesn't email or text you back, consider yourself lucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear the latest from Iran today? The Iranian government is claiming that their scientists have developed a time machine, which could explain how their leader got all those 1980s members only jackets.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, nation. This week NASA unveiled an exciting new plan to fight our space enemies?Yes, a NASA lasso because the most advanced technology they can afford with their budget is rope.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida senator and former astronaut Bill Nelson said the mission would 'help NASA have the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid away if one headed to Earth.' And if nudging doesn't work they could forced to develop scooching technology. Folks I love this plan to drag an asteroid into Earth's orbit because nothing embodies the spirit of American laziness like bringing space to us.&quot; Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So bravo NASA for pioneering the future of space-stayploration and I dream of a day when one small step for man is literally one step because we parked the moon outside the Kennedy Space Center.&quot; Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 2012 Presidential campaign will most likely be best remembered for the battle the Republicans and Democrats waged for the African-American vote.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;In 2012 President Obama won 93% of the black vote.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Oh, they were so close. All that is about to change as the Republican Party began minority voter outreach program. Yesterday Kentucky Senator Rand Paul fell asleep on the Washington metro's green line and ended up at historically black Howard University where he decided to speak.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Korean pop star, Psy?he just announced that he's gonna release his new song tomorrow. As soon as they heard that, North Korea was like, 'oh, now they're really asking for it.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, listen to this, according to 'Foreign Policy Magazine,' the United States and North Korean officials secretly met in New York City last month. In fact, sources say this meeting was so secret, not even Dennis Rodman knew about it.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday on North Korean state television, they broadcast a poem entitled 'Final War with the US Imperialists.' And the sad thing, still got higher ratings than NBC. I couldn't believe that.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Vice President Dick Cheney, he has spoken out about the North Korean situation. He said, 'When it comes to North Korea, we are in deep doo doo.' That was his exact quote. Deep doo doo. So apparently, all those years of briefing President Bush have taken their toll, you know?&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest is that North Korea officials are planning a cyber attack on the US in an effort to bring our economy to a halt. Nice try, guys. You're five years too late, okay?&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, President Obama hosted Republican senators for dinner at the White House. The President said he had to do without salt, pepper, and butter, because as you know, the Republicans refused to pass anything.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a long list of celebrities have signed a letter to President Obama asking him to ease the nation's drug enforcement policy. Hollywood celebrities are and musicians want the President to ease our drug laws. It's always the people you least expect. I'm stunned by that.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Mattel is coming under fire for the new doll, the Mexican Barbie, because she comes with her own little pink passport. Well, some people are offended by this. Here's the sad part. This is the closest thing we have come yet to any kind of immigration reform.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA announced a plan to lasso an asteroid and bring it closer to Earth. This is according to the head of NASA, a six-year-old boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are still very tense in North Korea. In fact, world leaders are still waiting to see if Kim Jong Un is going to actually fire a missile after this week's deadline came and went. Apparently what happened was he messed up and bought Mentos and regular Coke.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's looking like President Obama might actually get his gun control bill passed. Politicians are ? they're all weighing in. Yesterday, Joe Biden said that some people buy guns because owning one feels like driving a Ferrari. At which point, Obama was like, 'stop helping.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Anthony Weiner, remember him?...Well, he told 'The New York Times Magazine' he's thinking of running for mayor of New York City. Well?I guess he got tired of sitting around the House all day in front of the computer in his underwear.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama now telling North Korea to tone down some of their crazy rhetoric. The same thing he told Jay-z, actually. The same thing.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you remember a couple of years ago, somebody stole President Obama's teleprompter from one of his personal appearances? Remember that story? The guy stole the teleprompter. The President got there and it was gone. Well, that man has been caught and sentenced to seven years in prison. And at the sentencing, the judge asked the man if he had anything to say. And the man said, 'My fellow Americans, today we stand at an impasse. We've seen the mistakes of the past and the opportunities of the future.' That's what he had to say. I'm just telling you.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an envelope with white powder in it was found&quot; in the office Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa. &quot;White powder in an envelope. So it sounds like the mayor's been hanging out with Charlie Sheen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next, nation, I've told you about the Republican Party's rad, new effort to totally connect with us young Americans. Well, they've done it again.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;The National Republican Congressional Committee made the move to redesign their website. Enter Buzzfeed, an all encompassing site that mixes politics, pop culture and weird news from all over the world.&quot; Unidentified speaker: &quot;This is the new site. Essentially it's the NRCC's attempt to take everything that made Buzzfeed work and feed it through a partisan political prism.&quot; Colbert: &quot;Yes the NRCC is taking inspiration from pop-culture, list-making site Buzzfeed, which itself takes inspiration from ADHD.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, I've been inter-surfing the new Buzzfeed-inspired NRCC site, and there are ten reasons this adorable pundit loves it. Check out this actual story: '13 Animals That Are Really Bummed On Obama-care's Third Birthday,' featuring this baby seal with the line, 'Obama-care is leaving job creators out in the cold.' Or this puppy with the line, 'This puppy is upset that health insurance premiums are actually $3,000 higher since Obama-care passed.' I have not seen such an effective mix of bald political messaging and cuddly animals since gerbils and their benighted sub-human race posters. So, bravo, NRCC, for taking inspiration from Buzzfeed. I would not be surprised if they got some ideas from you, too, like the '18 Most Embarrassing Republican Youth Outreach Fails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>

Marco Rubio, Florida: &quot;You're going to have to pay a fine, an application fee. You have to pass a background check.&quot; Stewart: &quot;Background check? That's easy to get around, background check. All you've got to do is tell immigration you're a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a strange day today. First of all, he was forced to address a rumor involving Jay-Z and Beyonce. Jay-Z and Beyonce celebrated their anniversary in Cuba earlier this month, even though Americans are not permitted to travel to Cuba without permission from the government. Jay-Z just released a song called 'Open Letter' about the trip, and the lyrics say, 'Boy from the hood, but got White House Clearance. Obama said chill, you're going to get me impeached.' And some people assumed that meant Obama gave them the okay to travel there. But during an interview with the 'Today Show,' Obama said he didn't. He said we got better things to do. He's keeping his mind on our money and our money on his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On top of that, it was revealed today that someone sent President Obama a suspicious letter containing the poison ricin. Ricin is a deadly poison made from beans. It's silent, but deadly poison made from beans. They said ricin is the third worst substance you can send in the mail behind anthrax and packing peanuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's funny, people think a letter they send to the President is going to be delivered to his desk. I've got news for you. The President doesn't open his own mail. He's busy planning vacations for Beyonce and Jay-Z.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal law enforcement agencies say they believe the letter to Obama was from the same individual who sent a ricin-filled envelope to Republican Senator Roger Wicker yesterday. So, at least the guy's bipartisan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI has the suspect in custody. His name is Kenneth Curtis, and they think he's the guy ? this is true ? because both letters were signed, 'I am KC and I approve this message.' It was either him or Katie Couric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President weighed in on North Korea today. The White House believes North Korea has a number of medium-range, non-nuclear missiles set up on their east coast ready to fire. The missiles could easily strike targets in South Korea, which?you know what? I'm sick of 'Gangnam Style' too, but missiles to South Korea? It seems like an overreaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mysterious letters sent to President Obama and Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker. Tests indicate these letters contain the poison ricin. Sadly, when you're in the public eye, this stuff happens. That's why I never open my own email.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fast-moving story and there's still a lot we don't know. For instance, there's a Senator Roger Wicker? There's only 100 of these folks and I never heard that name before. Roger Wicker does not sound plausible as a senator. Sounds more like a patio furniture store. Next thing, you're telling me there's a Congresswoman Jennifer Convertibles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama working very hard to get his immigration bill passed. ... This is a true story. President Obama offered to wash senators' cars if it would lead to an immigration bill. He did. He said, 'I'll wash your car.' Senators then told Obama, 'If you're going to wash our cars, why do we need immigrants?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he did not know Jay-Z and Beyonce were taking a trip to Cuba. When he heard this, Bill Clinton was outraged and said the President should know where Beyonce is at all times! It's part of the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator Rand Paul, of course a big favorite for the tea party, suggested he may run for president in 2016, although his first choice would be to run for president in 1954.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been three days and concrete information about the terror attacks in Boston has been slow in coming. Luckily, there is one news outlet that doesn't let a lack of facts get in the way of reporting them. Of course, that's the 'New York Post.' Today, they ran this cover story showing two men from the marathon crowd under the headline 'Bag Men: Feds Seek These Two Pictured At Boston Marathon.' So, be on the lookout for these guys. And while you're on the lookout for these guys, keep in mind, these are not the guys. ... A quick tip of the hat to the 'New York Post' for accusing these two innocent men of a horrible crime, because anyone can print accurate information. But the 'Post' always follows the four Ws of journalism: who, whatever, and why wait?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I'm sure you agree with me that it is a proud day to be an American, because thanks to a minority of US Senators, we no longer have to live in fear of some maniac coming after those we love with a gun control bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, 45 brave senators stood tall to protect what they hold most precious: their A-rating from the NRA. Like Republican Senator and Brylcreem storage facility Ted Cruz, who fought this background-check bill because he knows it would put us on an inevitable path to a national gun registry, even though it's not proposed in the bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, just because the bill doesn't propose a gun registry, doesn't mean it won't eventually happen. Remember, there's also nothing in the rule book that says a golden retriever can't play basketball, although, under current law, it can buy a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the heroes were not just Republicans. Four brave Democrats joined in, including Alaska Senator Mark Begich, who celebrated his vote to kill background checks, saying, 'It's dangerous to do any type of policy in an emotional moment.' Yes, true leadership is waiting until the moment has passed. That's why I've always believed that we should have waited until 1950 to declare war on Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I especially want to salute Senate Majority Leader Wayne LaPierre. He delivered a huge victory for a misunderstood minority, the eight-percent of Americans who are against universal background checks. Now, some say anyone who would oppose keeping guns out of the hands of murderers and the mentally ill are outside of the mainstream, perhaps even psychologically unsound themselves. But we'll never know, because thanks to 45 senators, there will be no background checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the failure of the Senate to pass the bill that would have expanded background-checks for gun purchases) &quot;Only the United States Senate could take something that has 86% support of all Americans and an eight-vote majority in the Senate, itself, as a no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet to battle the evil of terror, we started two wars, tortured people, reorganized almost the entire Federal government, disallowed the air-trafficking of shampoo and conditioner, and okayed the robot sky-killing of American citizens if warranted by someone, because one American life lost to terror is one too many, which I agree with. But it seems to me we'll move heaven and earth to do whatever it takes to keep weapons from falling into the hands of foreigners who might kill our citizens, because apparently we think killing our citizens is our job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man in Virginia has been sentenced to seven years in prison for stealing a truck carrying President Obama's teleprompter. Remember that a while back? This guy stole the President's teleprompter. Now, the President had no comments. He did, but they were on the teleprompter, so he couldn't say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain is now calling Kim Jong-Un 'a clown' and 'a fool.' Hey, John McCain has been in the Senate 27 years. He knows clowns and fools when he sees them. He's not fooling around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Texas this Thursday, I believe, is the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and think tank. ? The George W. Bush think tank. I think he's in the shallow end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the only good news we've had in a week. Anthony Weiner is running for mayor of New York City. He announced it earlier today in his underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Weiner says that he's going to run because he's done extensive polling. And I said, 'I know! That's what got you in trouble in the first place!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's stooge is Senator James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma. That's right, James Inhofe voted no on gun control. He said the families of Newtown shootings had nothing to do with the debate on gun control, only thought they did, because they were told so by President Obama. There he is. Ladies and gentlemen, our stooge of the night, James Inhofe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wake of the Boston terror attack, the only thing more important than getting immigration reform done is slowing immigration reform down. You're welcome. This is a bit of a Rorschach crime in the same way you might look at this Rorschach blot and see a beautiful butterfly sitting on a penis. Whereas others might look at that Rorschach and see an annoying butterfly blocking my view of that penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chechnya might as well be a suburb of Narnia. For 12 years, Americans have been told a nice little story about who the bad guys are and what they look like. And then along come these two. They're Muslim. They're white. They're immigrants, but they're Americans. They're athletes. Dzhokhar is a monster, yet kind of a hottie. I get that. They're from the suburbs, yet they like the hip-hop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The George W. Bush Library is opening, except the history section. That's being rewritten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, how should the United States respond to this act of terror? Where should we strike back? Well, let's review what we know. They are Muslims. They are brothers. Which makes them the Muslim brotherhood. That means Egypt. Then again, they are from Chechnya, located in the Caucasus Mountains, which makes these terrorists Caucasians. So be on the lookout for Caucasian males with dark hair and anger issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, so many people out there confuse Chechnya with the Czech Republic, but the Czech ambassador to the US released a statement saying the Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities. Hmmm. Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, I am right now being told by this prompter that there's breaking news in the war on terror. ? Yes, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or Mounties, have thwarted an Al Qaeda-inspired terrorist attack, which is quite a fate considering how hard it is for them to go under cover. Folks, I would like to say a word to our friends up north - you Canadians are a brave and heroic people. If I have said it once, this is the one time I said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the American Society of Civil Engineers recently released their quadrennial report card, and for the first time in 15 years we improved our grade. They gave our infrastructure a D, but this year we have rocketed up to D+. Boom! We are climbing the ladder. By the way, do not climb that ladder. It is a death trap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this report, which gives a comprehensive assessment of a nation's infrastructure, was released in March, but I just got it because the delivery truck spent four days stuck in a pothole. ? According to the report, we can now proudly say that only 25% of our nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. That's right. There is a three-in-four chance if you drive across a bridge, you will make it to the other side. And America can hold its head high, knowing when it comes to our nation's levees, 8% are in acceptable condition. Of the remaining levees, 22% are unacceptable, 42% are constructed of old marshmallow peeps, and 28% don't want to work. They just want to bang on the drum all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Oregon, the Oregon House of Representatives passed a new state law that involves Facebook. It's illegal for employers to ask their employees or job applicants for their passwords to their social media accounts. I didn't know that was legal in the first place. The new law is called the Vacation Feed Protection Act. It's now illegal for employers to force their employees to like or friend them on Facebook. So now if your boss wants to stalk you he has to do it the old fashioned way, from the bushes. I don't ask my employees to friend me, but I require them to come to my office and show me a picture of what they had for lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of exciting. 'Science' magazine says two planets have been discovered that looked like they could support life, which is great news for us. You know, China's just about tapped out. We got to find new places to borrow money from. We may have to go outside the solar system.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A US Intelligence Agency has put together a psychological profile of Kim Jong-Un, and they say's he is a narcissist.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Congressman Anthony Weiner - remember him? The Peter Tweeter, you know the guy we are talking about? Well, he says he wants to run for mayor of New York City. Actually, he's pretty philosophical about what happened. He says, in life, when one zipper closes, another one opens up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The George W. Bush Presidential Library opens, I think, the first week in May, and [is] distinguishing itself in that it is the only presidential library that will have a fitness bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to new poll information, Americans now think very strongly, positively, of George W. Bush. New polls indicate - yeah. How about that? Well, by God, maybe there's hope for me. Americans think positively of him. Sounds like another phony report from the AP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some happy news ladies and gentlemen. Anthony Weiner is back on Twitter. Do you remember Congressman Anthony Weiner? I'm telling you, it's like giving Lindsay Lohan the keys to the mini bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a nice story out of Washington. Tonight, President Obama invited all 20 female Senators over to dinner at the White House. Or as one guy put it - [as Bill Clinton] 'Man, I miss that job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, thanks to the sequester, if you have flown in the last couple of days you may have noticed that you didn't fly in the last couple of days. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An academic paper by Harvard economists Rogoff and Reinhart, which conservatives worldwide are using to argue for austerity, was recently refuted by a U Mass grad student just because it had a few simple spreadsheet errors and a couple of little staggering omissions that made it slightly, fundamentally wrong.

And the guy the FBI arrested was an Elvis impersonator. An Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis. They burst into his house, they took him into custody, and then yesterday, they realized he was innocent and let him go. When they asked him about the ricin, he said 'I don't even eat rice.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, in an interview to mark the opening of the library, when asked about his relationship with Dick Cheney...President Bush said it was 'cordial.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie?was in Texas today for the dedication of the President George W. Bush's presidential library. The library's already done, but they brought in Christie for a second groundbreaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked about his relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, Bush used the word cordial. He said their relationship was cordial. Let's be fair.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But why is it the detrimental effects of the sequester, the painful, across-the-board budget cuts that are wreaking havoc on Federal services, seem like they're here to stay? Extended unemployment benefits are running out in western Massachusetts. Head Start programs are closing early in Rhode Island. Jobless California workers are forgoing $1.2 billion each week. Seniors in Maine are going without Meals on Wheels ? Praise it be our esteemed leaders! What bold legislative action have they undertaken to ease America's burden? Why, per chance, that part of the sequester? [Bill restoring FAA funding] Oh, right! Oh, right! Because it's the problem from the sequester that affects them. They don't care about Meals on Wheels unless it's rolling down an aisle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, gay marriage proponents love to compare their struggle to the civil rights movement. Thankfully, conservative stalwart and man who wishes Kenny G would turn down that rock music, Pat Buchanan, recently shot that comparison down, writing, 'When Martin Luther King called on the nation to live up to the meaning of its creed he heard an echo from a thousand pulpits. Treating black folks decently was consistent with what Christians had been taught.' But these gay activists will not get the same kind of support King got from conservative Christians. As Pat writes, 'If the gay rights agenda is imposed we could have priests and pastors preaching not acceptance but principled rejection, a public rejection of the new laws by millions and a refusal by many to respect or obey them. A new era of civil disobedience may be at hand.' ? Our struggle will not be easy, my straight brothers and sisters ? No, we need to take personal action. Just as the Little Rock Nine marched into that school, so too, must we march into Brian and Roger's wedding and chain ourselves to the champagne fountain. And when you RSVP, which of course you'll do because it will be a fun wedding, check the box for chicken, but when you arrive ask for the salmon. It will throw catering into chaos. Then, when they least expect it, sidle up to the DJ and request a one-hour block of Phish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

As part of a mandatory government spending cut, the FAA was forced to cut hours for air traffic controllers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the opening of the Bush library, former President Bush's approval rating has gone up. He's now at 47%. He's tied with President Obama. ... I read a story over the weekend that said George Bush was secretly smart. That's one secret the White House never managed to leak out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama held a press conference earlier today. He said he still wants to close the Guantanamo Bay prison facility, but he doesn't know how to do it. He should do what he always does. Declare it a small business and tax it out of existence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Senate hearing on drones, former Vice President Walter Mondale said the drone strikes by the United States are used by our adversaries to call us hypocrites. Can you believe that? Walter Mondale is still alive? Really? I'm stunned. I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'The New York Times' is reporting that the CIA has given Afghanistan's President Karzai and his government tens of millions of dollars in cash to buy influence. See, throwing a lot of money at something is not always the solution. Just ask the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk here in California of letting noncitizens serve on juries. The bad news - if you're ever on trial for underpaying your nanny, you could get the death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few weeks ago, the FBI arrested an Elvis impersonator in connection with those ricin-tainted letters. ... They let him go. They now report the FBI is searching for a Wayne Newton impersonator.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are new reports that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will not run for President in 2016 if Hillary Clinton does.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of San Diego has said that he wants Mitt Romney to lead San Diego's bid to bring the 2024 Olympics to his city. When asked why, the mayor said, 'Because I don't really want the Olympics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch the news as closely as I do, you know the sequester budget cuts are here. The unemployed have seen smaller benefit checks, some cancer patients have gone without treatment, and lines at New York's LaGuardia airport now start at Chicago's O'Hare. Tough medicine. But conservatives like me know that in a budget crisis, everything nonessential has to go - whether it's food for kids who aren't mine or some other stuff for people I don't know. But there are some things that government spends money on that are worth - stay with me - spending money - stay with me - on. And, as usual, those things are tanks. They are so important that we need them even when we don't need them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, the tanks are going to roll and it's all 'tanks' to Ohio's Senator Rob Portman and Congressman Jim Jordan. It's a brave stance for these fiscal conservatives. Congressman Jordan, who represents Lima, Ohio, where the tanks are manufactured, defended the cost saying, quote, 'The one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country.' The other area, you know ? his district. And if the Army doesn't really want them, that's fine. These two have voted to cut funding to all kinds of services, and the tanks can help fill the gaps. For instance, Meals on Wheels got hit by the sequester. Let's replace it with Breads on Treads. I mean, one of these tanks can barrage the elderly with sticky buns from three miles away. And we may not be able to pay for cancer patients' medicine anymore, but we can offer them one last bad-ass day of adventure. And it's not just the social services. I mean, in the military, the Blue Angels' budget has been slashed, but it will be just as exciting to watch the Gray Tankles. The best part is we won't have to shut down the tank plant in Lima, Ohio. And that will save jobs. Well, two of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Carolina Senator Richard Burr?voted no on gun-reform legislation. Last month, Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, it seems these days every time you turn on the news, there's another heart-breaking story about victims of gun violence targeting innocent members of Congress. It has to end. And I know I'm not going to win any awards for saying that. Unless the NRA gives out awards. They do? Oh, it's a seat in the Senate? Great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?The latest senseless victim of these victims is New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, one of the heroes who voted to block the gun bill that would have expanded background checks and made Americans wait 30 minutes after eating before firing a gun in a pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'm telling you, we cannot underestimate the danger posed by the victims of gun violence. They are sympathetic figures who are fanatically committed to having someone do something and their numbers are growing every day. That's why Senator Joe Manchin, who co-sponsored the original background-check bill, has vowed to reintroduce it, all on the flimsy excuse that over 90% of Americans want it, making it slightly more popular than nacho cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, with the increasing frequency and magnitude of mass shootings, the victims and their families are winning the emotional argument. But some brave and heartless individuals are willing to fight back against the tyranny of empathy. Like 'National Review' columnist Kevin D. Williamson, who said of Gabby Giffords, quote, 'It should be noted that being shot in the head by a lunatic does not give one any special grace to pronounce upon public policy questions.' Oh, it is noted. Experiencing massive head trauma does not give you special insight. For instance, judging by his column, there is something wrong with Kevin Williamson's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden had a little trouble today. Plane Air Force Two [is] apparently stuck in Arizona because of problems with its engine. Officials say they're trying to fix it as fast as they can. And then Obama was like, 'No rush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney gave the commencement address at Southern Virginia University and he encouraged graduates to get married young and have lots of kids. Then he was like, 'Oh, and give them all weird names. Have you met Tagg?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA has just ruled that girls as young as 15 can now obtain the contraceptive Plan B pill without a prescription, because before that, most teenagers' plan B was getting a show on MTV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Treasury Department says it has enough extra money to pay down some debt for the first time since 2007.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Google's new glasses will let users send tweets with their eyes. You can send tweets completely hands free, or as Anthony Weiner put it, 'Jackpot!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the US government apparently spent millions of dollars in cash to fund various dubious government projects in Afghanistan, including solar panels and wind farms that never really work. No, I'm sorry. That's what we did here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had it backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there is now a push in Congress from Republicans and Democrats to spend an extra $436 million on the Abrams tank, even though the Army says they don't want it. The Army says they don't want this tank. They don't need the tank. I mean, how pathetic is that? The only time Congress works together is when it's to waste our money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State Department released a list of the gifts that President Obama has received from foreign officials. ... Putin gave him vodka; Prince Charles gave him golf bags; and Kim Jong-Un re-gifted Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney gave a commencement speech where he advised graduates to start a family before they turned 30. He also advised them to pay for it by inheriting millions of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's economy has been on the upswing the last couple of years. It's unbelievable. They're getting investors from companies all over the world. In fact, Mexico is now home to 11 million undocumented Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama gave the commencement speech at Ohio State University. He said, 'I dare you to do better.' That's what he told the students. 'I dare you to do better.' To which the students yelled back, 'No, we dare you to do better.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the US Geological Survey, there are 7.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in North Dakota. And today, Dick Cheney said if we had known how much oil they had, we would have invaded North Dakota years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has changed his mind. He decided to support the morning after pill being available over the counter. ... President Obama finally saw an episode of 'Teen Mom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PETA is really upset at Chris Christie for killing a spider in front of a group of school children. ... Governor Christie said, 'If PETA's upset by that, they do not want to know what I had for lunch today.' Apparently Orb is missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's nephew, George P. Bush, is running for office in Texas. Yeah, he says the 'P' stands for 'Pretend you've never heard the name George W. Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company is coming out with a beer drone - a beer drone to deliver beer to attendees at music festivals. ... And in a related story, everyone's now fine with drones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama spoke at Ohio State's graduation and told their students that it's their responsibility to make the world a better place. Which got awkward, when they were like, 'Wait, isn't that literally your responsibility?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some experts are saying that the 2016 Democratic presidential primary could come down to Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Biden is calling her 'a worthy opponent,' and Hillary's calling him 'practice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden could be running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Even though the election is a few years off, we thought it would be helpful to show a side-by-side comparison to see some of their differences. Take a look. Hillary wants to bridge the gap between Democratic and Republican leaders. Biden wants to bridge the gap between Marvel and DC superheroes. Hillary has had to fight against a sexist political system. Biden has had to fight against the safety cap on his Flintstones vitamins. ... Hillary has already imagined what it would be like to sit in the President's chair. Biden has already spent hours sitting in it and spinning around. ... Hillary believes her greatest asset is her experience at dealing with complicated international issues. Biden just laughed at the word 'asset.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you had a great weekend. I did. I spent it at the big, annual NRA meeting in Houston, Texas. Not to be confused with the daily NRA meeting that is Houston, Texas. And this year's theme was accessories - like pink assault rifles and bra holsters. Now, fellows can brag about getting to Second Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing I heard repeatedly down there this weekend is that Obama is coming for our guns. Now, I'm not one to believe in far-out conspiracy theories, probably because the government implanted a chip in my brain that controls my thoughts. But, folks, I've had my eyes opened to some disturbing truths that raise troubling questions. Like, what did they know? When did they know it? And what am I talking about? Which brings me to my new segment exposing vast government conspiracies, 'Stephen Colbert's Bat[bleep] Serious.' Now, folks, I've wanted to do this segment for a long time. But I haven't. Why not? We'll look into that next time. But tonight's topic: Are they coming after our guns? No. They're coming after our bullets. ? Nation, follow me down the rabbit hole. If it even is a rabbit and not a groundhog in a costume. The Federal government's suspicious ammo hoarding was first noticed by vigilant online conspiracy forums before it was picked up by conservative radio hosts and then eventually made its way out to the farthest fringe elements of our society - Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Leading the congressional charge is Senator James Inhofe, if this is James Inhofe and not a groundhog in a costume. Senator Ground-hofe here recently introduced a bill that would ban Federal agencies from buying more ammunition if it currently possesses more than its monthly averages during the Bush Administration. Yes, not including the ammo that ended up in the faces of the friends of Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, a lot of news outlets, including Fox News, say that they have debunked the bullet conspiracy theory, but I say it's already started. Because out of fear of government hoarding, ammo sales have skyrocketed making it harder to find ammo, which can only mean that the government is hoarding it, which means we have to buy more ammo before the government gets it all, but there's none left because we bought it. Oh, my God. It's too late. The feds already have us outgunned. Well, they're not going to take me alive. ? Well, that's it for tonight's 'Bat[bleep] Serious.' Join me next time when I ask the question, 'Did Bigfoot help Lee Harvey Oswald build Stonehenge?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was speaking to a group of schoolchildren the other day, a spider crawled out near him on one of the kids' desks and Christie killed the spider. Now, this is true. PETA has lodged a complaint against him for killing the spider. ... You know, usually when Christie attacks something that has six legs or more, it's a turducken, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie also revealed he had lap band surgery back in February. There have been rumors he had a gastric bypass or he might have had his stomach stapled. No, he had the lap band. And President Obama wished him well, which is nice. In fact, Obama is thinking about having Joe Biden's mouth stapled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couple days ago, President Obama played golf. Went out with three or four Congressmen, Senators, they were playing golf, one of them said to him, 'Mr. President, what is your handicap?' Talking about golf. And he said, 'I'll tell you, my handicap, the Republicans.' That's what he said. One guy had a hole in one! You know what the odds are of a hole in one? 13,000-1. Give you an idea, those odds are just a little better than passing gun control laws. Just a little better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Did you hear about this? He had the stomach surgery so he won't be so big. ... But his family gave him a choice, they said, 'Look, you either have that surgery or get your own zip code.' ... And the governor is now saying that his decision has nothing to do with 2016, which, by the way, is his cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie revealed that he underwent a surgery that restricts the amount of food he can eat. As a result, 12 animals have been removed from the endangered species list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked if Hillary Clinton will run for president, Bill Clinton said, 'She's having a little fun being a private citizen.' Then he added, 'Not Bill Clinton-fun, but fun, nonetheless.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Texas man has fired the first ever gun created by a 3D printer. Which raises the question - don't you think a gun created by a printer would jam?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama and Joe Biden met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who is known as South Korea's Iron Lady. Or as Biden put it, 'Can you introduce me to Iron Man?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biden gave advice on how to avoid war with North Korea. Or, in other words, I think we're going to war with North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss ? that sounds like a pimp name. Well anyways, he's a Republican Senator who was playing golf with the President and actually shot a hole in one. ... Saxby immediately started bragging. He was like, 'How does that feel?' And Obama's like, 'I don't know, like winning two elections in a row?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is losing weight. ? Some say that he's running for president, that it's a sure sign. Because why else would a 50-year old man with young children and a loving family take steps to address obesity and extend his life. Why else? It is a classic presidential run tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am interrupting tonight's regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you breaking news. Repeat: Tonight's Colbert report will not be seen, because there has been a major development in the investigation into the tragic attack on our embassy in Benghazi, Libya. Since last September, Fox News has been pursuing this story doggedly to uncover how the Administration blew it, when they blew it, why they blew it, and how they will continue to have blown it. ? Well, buckle up, folks, because this story is about to take off like a rocket ship to planet Scandal Town. ? Folks, this is the best possible kind of political story. We have no idea what's in it, and it's going to be explosive. It's the Taco Bell of breaking news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Tuesday's SC1 special election) &quot;My sister lost. How could this happen? I was so sure Lulu (Colbert Busch) had won because CNN called it for Sanford. But the voters ? what can I say ? the voters of South Carolina have spoken. Mark Sanford beat my sister, and I believe that means Mark Sanford is now my sister. And on behalf of my entire family, I want to say we're deeply sorry about him. Now I know how Kevin Manson must have felt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love my sister. And I'm so proud of her. But I just don't get it. Where did Lulu go wrong? Did she not campaign hard enough? Did she not raise enough money? Did she hold too few debates against a cardboard Nancy Pelosi?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to tell you this scares me to my core. I'm shaking. This was the first political campaign where I knew and cared about the candidate before they got into politics. I saw first-hand how her opponents smeared her with outrageous accusations I knew to be untrue. And that has made me wonder if other campaigns have done this as well. I mean, is it possible that John McCain actually doesn't have an illegitimate black child? And does that mean Megan McCain is white? I don't know what to believe anymore. And could it be that I have lied about candidates I disagree with, like that time I said that Harry Reid is just a leather saddle bag brought to life by a Navajo shaman? I mean it feels true, but maybe it's not. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all, partisanship has made it almost impossible for anything to get done in Washington. Congress can't raise the debt ceiling. They can't pass a budget. And the House spent all last week debating whether they are deadlocked or gridlocked until they finally reached a stalemate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, some people out there blame this on rifts within the Republican Party. For instance, the GOP-controlled House took two days to pass legislation that extended the government's helium reserves, which Democrats would have allowed them to pass by unanimous voice vote. But you can't pass a helium bill by voice vote. It would be embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, of course other people say it's Obama's fault, like 'New York Times' columnist Maureen Dowd, who recently wrote, 'The job of the former community organizer and self-styled uniter is to somehow get Congress to do the stuff he wants them to do. It's called leadership.' Yes, the definition of leadership is getting people who despise you to work with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent Gallup poll on gun control found that 73% of Republicans would vote to expand background checks, but a second Gallup poll found that 50% of Republicans approved the Senate not passing background checks. That means 23% of Republicans are happy that the Senate voted against the background checks that those same 23% would have voted for. Well, I certainly hope they wrote their senators a nice thank you threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the President goes left, we go right. He zigs, we refuse to raise the debt limit and destroy the global economy. But don't get smug, Democrats, because in 2009, 72% of Democrats supported Obama's plan to close Guantanamo within a year. But after Obama backed off, only 32% of Democrats wanted to close it. That's what I call a flip-flop. Unless the President calls it that, in which case I call it integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina had a congressional election yesterday, and - you remember Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina? He got himself into some trouble, and he had to go away. Well, he's back, and he won the congressional seat?yesterday, and it's crazy because there's nothing like a guy who stands up for traditional values while he's&quot; having an affair with &quot;an Argentine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this guy, Mark Sanford, smart guy. Got his scandal out of the way before he went to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Secretary of State John Kerry went over to see Vladimir Putin over there in Russia - the evil Vladimir Putin and John Kerry, Secretary of State.&quot; (Noting that Putin kept Kerry waiting) &quot;Yes, three hours. He had a good excuse. Putin was on the phone with Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I'm talking about with Dennis Rodman? He's buddied up now with Kim Jong Un, the vicious, evil dictator of North Korea. ... And Dennis Rodman visited Kim Jong Un a couple months ago and apparently they're really, really close friends now. And earlier in the week, Dennis Rodman sent a message, like a Twitter message or a tweet-text message or something, to Kim Jong Un, and the message read, 'Kim Jong Un, do me a solid and release an American prisoner.' ... Who does this guy think he is, Charlie Sheen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news here in the tri-state area, Chris Christie, who was on our show - seems like a great guy to me, really working day and night helping New Jersey recover [from] Hurricane Sandy - wonderful man, but he weighed about 600 pounds. And so, finally he said to his family, he said, 'You know what? You deserve better than this, so for 2012, I'm really, really going to lose some weight.' 2012, by the way, was his cholesterol. ... So here's what he does...the very next day he goes to a place, secretly has a...procedure done on his stomach so he won't eat food anymore, and now he's telling everybody? It was a secret, but he's lost 40 pounds. Really? ... If you've lost 40 pounds and it's still a secret, then you must really have been pretty damn heavy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was being interviewed recently. He said that, despite all the speculation, Hillary hasn't said anything to him about running for president in 2016. Though, in fairness, she hasn't said anything to him since 1998.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning comeback, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, remember him? He's the guy who told his wife he was going for a hike, then went to Argentina to see his girlfriend. He was then exposed as an unethical, lying, cheating weasel. He has been elected to Congress, where he'll fit right in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New predictions claim that 42% of Americans will be obese by the year 2030. They say the only way to stop it is for government to step in. Oh, yeah, that will work. When it comes to trimming the fat and tightening your belt, who knows better than the US government? Yeah, they do a hell of a job. Don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie recently had lap band surgery, and some sad news, today the lap band snapped and killed five bystanders. Pundits speculate he got the lap band surgery because they felt his weight could be a potential issue on the national stage. Yes, the national stage would actually collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how about former Vice President Al Gore? According to 'Forbes' magazine, Al Gore is now worth more than $200 million. This is what Al Gore meant when he talked about going green.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says he's still adjusting after his surgery to reduce how much he can eat. He said, 'I now have six free hours a day I don't know what to do with.' A lot of time on his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snooki has come out and said she'd like to be Chris Christie's workout buddy. Yeah. Christie said, 'Thanks, but I already have a medicine ball.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Carolina, former Governor Mark Sanford won a congressional seat after dragging around and debating a cardboard cutout of Nancy Pelosi. Then someone explained that was Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss voted no on gun-reform legislation despite the fact that 91% of voters in his state, 91% of voters in his state, wanted background checks for gun buyers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as I'm sure you all know by now, disgraced former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has won back his old congressional seat.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was down in Texas on his Middle Class Jobs and Opportunities Tour. Now, don't confuse it with his first term - that was the Middle Class Jobs and Missed Opportunities Tour. ... And while...Obama was in Texas, he told people to remember the Alamo and forget about Benghazi.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually the Administration's now very concerned that the Benghazi hearings are gaining momentum. Like today at a press conference, even a non-Fox reporter asked about Benghazi, so - that never happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince Harry visiting the United States again. No, it's not that kind of visit this time. ... He stopped off at the Capitol, where he was greeted by Senator John McCain. McCain said, and I quote, he '? found Prince Harry to be a very attractive young man.' Senator McCain only met him for a few minutes, didn't really ask him any questions. You know, same as when he picked Sarah Palin as Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Minnesota, the Land of 10,000 Lakes, legalizing gay marriage. Now, that's good news. Unfortunately, there are no gays in Minnesota. And next, they're going legalize the Tony Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks know the show 'American Idol?' They have four judges on the show, and we've had many of them on our program, and periodically through the run of the show, they have made changes to the judging staff. Guess what? All four current judges fired. They're fired. So, they have to hire new judges. And I said, 'Well, who says Obama's not creating jobs?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about a nice hand for Governor Chris Christie from New Jersey. Dropped 40 pounds. Yup, dropped 40 pounds. His sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has been going around the country to rally support for his economic plan. And yesterday, he said that a lot of sectors of our economy are doing better. ... When pressed for examples, Obama said, 'Uh - the 'Iron Man' sequel sector.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was gonna start off tonight with an Obama joke. But I don't want to get audited by the IRS, so forget that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS has now admitted that they targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny. That's why Mitt Romney wanted to be President so bad, huh? Keep the IRS off his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time moves so quickly, you know? Sources say that soon, the Obamas will have to start looking for a place to live after they leave the White House. And they think he's planning to go back to the Chicago area. They're looking for a house with two stories. ... Which is ten stories fewer than Benghazi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colorado is going to become the first state to regulate and tax recreational marijuana. They're starting at a 15% excise tax and a 10% sales - that's 25%. You know, it's bad enough the cost of living is high. Now, the cost of getting high is high. Well, actually, some people are concerned that if they tax it that high, people will go to drug dealers instead. They'll buy it from drug dealers instead, because it's cheaper. Which is depressing, isn't it? I mean, your government is greedier than the drug cartels?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, the West Wing of the White House was evacuated when an overheated transformer set off a smoke alarm. Or as Obama put it, 'Oh, yeah. Definitely check out that transformer. Kind of smells like Marlboro Lights. Crazy transformer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to be with you here tonight on my birthday! ... And, folks, when I woke up this morning, there was another fantastic gift underneath my birthday tree,&quot; a &quot;beautiful box of crippling scandal for the Obama Administration. ? But acts of terror, terrorist attack, is that really the scandal here? No. That's just semantics. This is also about the words people used. Let me set the stage, folks. This attack [Benghazi] came two months before the election. And Obama could not have an Al Qaeda attack on his watch when he's the one who personally strangled Bin Laden with one of his shoe laces - I believe that's what he claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, this is a new low for the IRS. What's next? Making GE pay taxes? Folks, there is only one way to describe a scandal this hot. ? It's chilling. Which also describes the champagne I've been waiting to break out for just this scandal. Folks, this proves that everything I've ever said about Obama is true. So it's official. He's a secret Muslim, shape-shifting alien from Kenya who is coming for our guns, and Bo is a member of the Illuminati.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heat wave, just continuing here in California. They are warning it is going to be a long, hot summer. And they're telling everyone to cover up. And believe me, you don't have to tell the Obama White House twice. They know about covering up. Not a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS has admitted they were targeting conservative groups. President Obama called...it 'outrageous,' and said he would immediately send his Benghazi investigators to look into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love what IRS commissioner Steve Miller said today about this whole targeting conservative groups thing. He said, 'Mistakes were made, but they were no way made with a political or partisan motivation.' 'Mistakes were made.' Try that during your next IRS audit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Aquarium in Washington, DC is closing its doors. Yeah. It's going to become a Red Lobster. ... The marine life will be sent elsewhere. Except the bottom feeders. They'll stay in DC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Texas are now warning people about a giant African land snail that's been found in that state. They say it's an invasive species, and it's already in Texas. I mean, how bad are our border guards? They can't catch snails?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is now accusing President Obama of a massive cover-up in Benghazi. ... John McCain, until a week ago, was under the impression that Benghazi was the stuff he rubs on his shoulders after working in the yard all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President held a press conference Monday, and the reporters were on him like a pack of wild dogs. He did pretty well, because, you know, he had been listening to their conversations. So, he knew exactly what was going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just revealed that the Department of Justice secretly recorded the phone calls of AP journalists for two months. Don't worry, Obama promised reporters that the incident will be immediately investigated - by the Department of Justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the daughter of House Speaker John Boehner got married in Florida. ... A wedding in Florida. So, Boehner could get a tan while crying. Or as he calls that, 'heaven.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can Congress reach a compromise on immigration reform? Or is passing legislation just a job Americans don't want to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, if you watch this show then you know that for years now journalists like me have been unable to get anything to stick to Teflon Obama. Well, no more, folks. Because every day this week brings a new scandal for his Administration. And I'm so disappointed that the week has only seven days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the meantime, this Thursday the House will hold an historic vote. House Speaker John Boehner announced the House of Representatives will vote once again next week to repeal Obamacare. For the 37th time. Thirty-seven, of course, is a prime number. Meaning it can be divided only by vicious partisanship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am telling you, folks, the donkey crowd just doesn't get it. Every Obamacare repeal is unique, because Republicans never play this issue the same way twice. And I know, because I've got every Obamacare repeal vote on bootleg. I trade tapes with all the other fans. We call ourselves 'Deadheads,' because without health insurance, a lot of people will die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And folks, the only thing I don't like is when the GOP gets all self-indulgent and tries to play their new stuff like immigration reform, which has begun its climb through Congress in a disturbing reminder that Hispanics can vote. And make no mistake, folks, the only reason the Republicans are doing this is because of the 2012 election. I don't know if you remember that one. Sadly, I do, despite drinking a smoothie of my entire medicine cabinet. You think a cocktail of Rolaids, Listerine and Gold Bond Powder would erase something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is having a rough week. He's currently being questioned on the Benghazi attack, the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Department of Justice seizing phone records from reporters of the Associated Press. A lot of people are saying that Obama could go down as our worst black president in more than 100 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a matter of like six weeks, three big scandals, and it looks like President Obama and all his buddies in the White House may go to prison. ... Finally, some good news for the Romney campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People always say this to me, they say, 'Hey, Letterman,' they say. 'Why don't you make jokes about Obama?' All right, I'll tell you why. ... I don't make jokes about him, because I don't want the FBI tapping my phone. That's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the three scandals, we have the IRS investigating people they don't like. Well, you know, you kind of gotta give them that, right? Then you have the FBI tapping phones. And then Benghazi. And they see?Benghazi as a powder keg; and this scandal, they believe, may go as high as Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have scandals like that, it really gets in the way of not getting things done. ... If they don't fix these crises pretty soon, honest to God, it could bring gridlock to a screeching halt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson voted no on gun reform legislation, in spite of the fact 81% of voters in his state wanted background checks. Ron Johnson said, no dice. Senator Johnson, he has received $1.2 million in contributions from pro-gun lobby groups. And as you can see (referring to a Rob Jonson photo) he spent most of that money on flag pins and hairspray.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these measures from the IRS and Justice were taken at the behest of the White House, that is Nixonian. At best, if you believe the Administration only found out about this stuff through news reports, it's still bad. It's just that the President's inner Magoo is being revealed. It's Magoovian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of these scandals could add up to very bad repercussions for the Obama Administration. And many?Republicans are entitled to their moment of righteousness, but guess what? History didn't start Friday. And Obama Administration transgressions don't wipe away yours, which are many and grievous. So, enjoy watching your friends have their fun, but twiddle-Dick (Dick Cheney) and twiddle-Rum (Donald Rumsfeld) don't get to join the party. It's like this. ... That's Mike Tyson. He doesn't get to make fun of someone's tattoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, President Obama is not having a good week. With three scandals shaking the White House, they're saying that this is one of the worst weeks of Obama's presidency. Obama's like, 'How could things get worse?' And Joe Biden was like, 'You rang?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Obama gave a commencement speech at Ohio State University. And on Monday, Joe Biden spoke at the University of Pennsylvania. And not surprisingly, their speeches were pretty different. Here, I'll show you what I mean. During his speech, Obama said, 'We've seen courage and compassion, a sense of civic duty and a recognition that we are not a collection of strangers.' And in Biden's speech, he said, 'You should never take candy from a stranger, unless it's Milk Duds. Those things are the bomb-diggity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another one. Obama said, 'While things are still hard for a lot of people, we have every reason to believe that your future is bright.' Biden said, 'My favorite thing about the future is Dippin' Dots.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last one, here. Obama said, 'Incredible advances in information and technology have the potential to change the way we do almost everything.' Biden said, 'I heard about these scientists in Norway who are working on giving squirrels tiny cell phones to help them keep in touch, or I might have dreamt that. Either way, cool, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard about this. The national aquarium in Washington, DC, is going to close. But don't worry. If you're in DC and you still want to smell something fishy, stop by the White House. There's something going on there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you know this week marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate hearings? Now, for those of you too young to remember, back then, the Administration had an enemies list. They were spying on reporters. They used the IRS to harass groups they didn't like. Thank God those days are gone forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a rough week for Obama. A lot of critics are comparing President Obama to President Richard Nixon, which is unfair. Nixon's unemployment rate was only five percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a huge story. You know this whole IRS thing? Apparently targeting conservative groups like the tea party? You know it's bad when President Obama says, 'Hey, why don't we talk about Benghazi? Anybody have questions about Benghazi?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Benghazi thing ? that's not gonna go away anytime soon either. The White House has gone from 'change you can believe in' to 'changing the story until you believe it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden speaking out in 'Rolling Stone' magazine. Finally, that guy is talking. He's so quiet. It's about time we heard what he has on his mind. In a new interview that just came out, Joe Biden says he spends four or five hours every day with President Obama. Yeah. In response, Obama said, Hiring that Obama impersonator was the best decision I've ever made.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough news for the Democratic Party. I don't know if you've heard about this, but since President Obama took office, the Democratic Party has lost nine governorships, 56 members of Congress and two Senate seats. Now, in his defense, Obama said, 'I did promise change.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Obama held a joint press conference with the Prime Minister of Turkey. Why Turkey, I'm not sure. I think those are the only sandwiches his wife lets him eat. The press didn't really care about the Prime Minister of Turkey. Reporters were focused on the numerous firestorms surrounding the White House right now. They drilled the President on Benghazi, the IRS, the subpoenaed phone records. They want to know why Randy Jackson is leaving 'American Idol.' And I think the stress is starting to get to Obama. At one point, he started screaming, 'I did not have sexual relations with Benghazi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, while President Obama is dealing with all of those controversies, this is what Vice President Biden is up to. A seven-year-old boy from Milwaukee, a kid by the name of Myles Nelson, wrote a letter to the Vice President. He has an interesting solution to our problem about gun violence. Miles wrote, 'Dear Vice President Biden, I have a great idea to make our country safer, better and the best. I think guns should shoot out chocolate bullets, so no one will get killed and no one will be sad. Sincerely, Miles.' On one hand, it's great this seven-year-old is concerned enough about gun safety he would write a letter to the Vice President. On the other hand, he's clearly stoned when he came up with this idea, right? And that's disturbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe it or not, the Vice President wrote Myles back. He said, 'Dear Myles, I'm sorry it took me so long to respond to your letter. I really like your idea. If we had guns that shot chocolate, not only would our country be safer, it would be happier. Happy people love chocolate. You are a good boy. Joe Biden.' You are a good boy? Do you think he thinks he was writing a letter to a dog? The saddest part is that is the first letter Biden received since he took office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen, kid ? if you really want a politician to get behind guns with chocolate bullets, the guy you should be writing to is Governor Christie. He will get this done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was outside for a little bit. It seemed hot. I was sweating like President Obama at a press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President, I'm telling you, a lot of trouble,&quot; with &quot;three different scandals going on. Today, the White House released 99 pages of emails on trouble in Benghazi?and one shirtless tweet from Anthony Weiner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?Senator Rob Portman. He voted no on gun reform legislation despite the fact that 83% of the voters in his state, let me repeat that, 83%...of the voters in his state wanted background checks for gun buyers. ... Rob Portman took a look at the data and said, 'No dice'. ... He's our 'Stooge of the Night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally. the IRS are in trouble! ...They have a new boss after it came out they unfairly targeted tea party groups. ... The President says the new IRS chief is not only good with numbers, but he has more integrity than the last guy. That's right, it's Bernie Madoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I hope you know, for Obama watchdogs like me, the last week of scandals has been like Christmas morning. ... Now, of course, Obama has been in full damage control trying to wiggle out of this one, just like he wiggled out of serving in Vietnam. Sorry, Mr. President, you can't escape this time by claiming to be eight years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, despite the Senate's recent defeat of universal background checks, the gun control debate rages on. Will America be a place where anyone, anywhere, can get a gun regardless of mental health or criminal record, or will we face the nightmare of not that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;?it seems like only yesterday that Barack Hussein?Obama began his second term as president with high hopes. But now, just four months later, he finds himself mired in an inescapable downward slog, where the only congressional action he can count on is punitive in nature. He has entered into a three-and-a-half year race of [bleep]. His only hope: the media?with the attention span of a concussed goldfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess this has not been a good week for President Obama.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama spoke at a college commencement, and he told them, as an African-American, quote, 'I could have been in prison. Could have been unemployed.' ... To which the Republican Party replied, 'Working on both.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Obama, he's apparently been saying that he wants to go 'Bulworth' in his second term, referring to the movie where a politician becomes brutally honest with his beliefs. He's already starting to say what's on his mind. Take a look at some of his recent tweets. Here's the first one. 'Today's jobs report is a reminder we can't afford self-inflicted wounds on the economy. Time to end the sequester with a balanced approach.' That's honest. Take a look at this next one. 'I was the one that suggested Michelle get bangs, yet I'm getting none of the credit. #thingsthatmakeyougohmm.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[On White House officials' knowledge of the IRS scandal] &quot;I know the cardinal rule is you don't get involved, but the problem here is the gap between involved in and aware of. It's like your kids want to make dinner for you. You don't have to be involved, but you should be aware that they're doing it. Or you get stuck explaining why your house burned down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry. It's becoming very clear that nobody really knows enough about these three scandal/issues to make any definitive judgment on them yet. But if it's a scandal you want, it's the scandal we have. In our recurring series about returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and the paperwork quagmire that await them, the Obama Administration made a promise in April of 2009 that they would create a seamless, computerized veterans health record system. Costs be damned! Critics said it couldn't be done. Four years and $1 billion later, it turns out, yeah, they were right, it couldn't be done. At least not by the Administration. In fact, it so couldn't be done there's still a backlog of claims for 900,000 veterans and paper disability records still undigitized and piled up so high the floor of one VA field office [that it] is going to collapse. Perhaps injuring people, who luckily, would at least have instant access to the proper forms they would need to file the crushed-pelvis claims and most likely have the time to fill them out because of how long it will take to dig them out of the rubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watch the news like I do, it seems like lately President Obama cannot swing a dead cat without hitting some sort of scandal. Which reminds me, what's he doing with all these dead cats? The challenge is, folks, which one to cover. So tonight, I am proud to introduce for the first time on the 'Colbert Report' the Obama Scandal Booth. ? Now, inside this booth are slips of paper, each with the name of a White House scandal: IRS, AP, Benghazi, immortal scorpion soldiers. Oh, it's coming out. And just moments from now, ladies and gentlemen, I will enter the booth and, like my colleagues, grasp wildly at any accusation that floats past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, Obama dumped acting IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, and I say it's about time. My sources tell me he's a joker, a smoker and a midnight toker. And often uses the alias Maurice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the tax-exempt groups singled out by the IRS are all social welfare organizations known as 501 (c) (4)s. Warning: The c-4 designation grew in value in 2010; right after the Supreme Court said corporations could spend unlimited cash on elections, c-4 applications more than doubled. C-4s are specifically forbidden to make politics their primary activity, but one advantage: they don't have to reveal their donors. A c-4 is like a super PAC that doesn't have to reveal its donors, which means they could be anyone from one of the Koch brothers all the way to the other Koch brother. And it is all perfectly legal, as long as politics isn't the group's primary activity - meaning your 501 (c) (4) can spend 49% of its efforts producing ads calling Barack Obama a socialist as long as it spends the other 51% doing something good for the community, like educating our children that Barack Obama is a socialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has admitted that President Obama's Chief of Staff had advanced warning the IRS was targeting conservative groups, but never told the President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These scandals at the White House just keep getting worse. It turns out now that President Obama's chief of staff knew about the scandal at the IRS three weeks before the President found out. Obama was like, 'Anything else you guys aren't telling me?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Obama's team knew about the IRS scandal, but kept him in the dark about it, or as Obama put it, 'Guys, when I said no spoilers, I was just talking about 'Game of Thrones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Congressman Jeff Duncan of South Carolina proposed a bill to forbid the US Census Bureau from conducting any survey except for a population count. Hear that, Census Bureau? Population count only. You have no right to my personal information. That belongs to Facebook! Jeff Duncan knows this is really a private privacy issue, explaining now the Census Bureau can ask citizens very invasive questions. ? Every few years they show up on our front porch asking for personal information. It's like a drunk ex-boyfriend. 'Suzanne, who's the new guy you're dating? What's the highest level of education he's completed, or is he Pacific Islander or other?' Folks, the government says census information is necessary for distributing government services, but the real plans for this information are anybody's guess. Or everybody's guess. Because according to reports published in the highly prestigious 'The Internet,' census data could very well be used to make a database of gun owners for confiscation, or direct UN troops where to kick in your door, or for something even more sinister, like tracking the corn harvest. Terrifying. It's like that horror movie 'Aggregate Yield of the Children of the Corn.' Besides, we don't need to count corn. I'm pretty sure at this point Monsanto has genetically engineered corn so much it can count itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I've got a confession to make. I'm no fan of Barack Obama. There, I said it. Somebody had to. But I am a fan of how he's handled the war on terror by following the exact same policies laid out by President Bush, who followed the exact same policies laid out by President Cheney, particularly his flying deathbot program, which some have criticized because it's been used to kill Americans overseas. But it's very limited in its scope, in that only an informed, high-level government official can order your death. That means the President or the Secretary of State - definitely no lower than the Postmaster General, which I assume means no more killing on Saturdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's all perfectly legal thanks to a 2001 congressional resolution called 'The Authorization for Use of Military Force' or AUMF. So-called, because it is what gives Obama's unchecked killing authority that special oomph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right here?this is the actual resolution, a svelte 60 words of eternal war-justifying deliciousness. Here we go. 'Be it resolved that the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred September 11, 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.' Folks, this is the most beautifully sweeping, knee-jerk declaration of vengeful fury since FDR said after Pearl Harbor, 'This is a date that will live in infamy. Hey, Tojo, I don't need to stand up to put my boot up your a**.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, this unlimited power to wage war wherever is the result of a careful, deliberative process, because after the September 11 attacks, Congress took an entire seven days to pass it. That's longer than it took God to make heaven and Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Obama's Thursday counterterrorism speech) &quot;The President wants to repeal the source of his power. That's like Ryan Gosling repealing his abs. Or Matthew McConaughey repealing his abs, or me repealing my power to name people with abs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to a Congressmember's comments on Obama's counterterrorism speech) &quot;Oh, great! Let's put Congress in charge of the war on terror. 'Hey, we have Al Qaeda number one in our sights? Do we hit him with a drone?' Three months of subcommittee hearings later, he's still on the loose, but Congress has named the Ayman al-Zawahiri post office. Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, I say the AUMF is too restrictive, because the resolution says you've got to link the terrorists you're killing to 9/11. So far, that has not been a problem, thanks to a high-level CIA technique known as 'Six Degrees of Guys Who Don't Eat Bacon.' For instance, here is how we justified?drone strikes in Yemen: Yemen, lemon, lemon lime, seven and seven, 7/11, 9/11. Perfectly legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine just released a picture of 17-year-old President Obama with his prom date. Did you see this? They would've published a picture of Joe Biden with his prom date, but his mom didn't want to be photographed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner. ... Well, he announced he is running for mayor of New York City. But he's having some problems. A lot of Democrats are distancing themselves from him. They think he doesn't represent the party. ... Doesn't represent the party? Every day, the White House gets caught with their pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not looking good for President Obama. Today, his teleprompter took the Fifth. That's bad sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they've changed their slogan from, 'Yes, we can' to 'No, I can't remember. I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest scandal in Washington, of course, is raising questions on the IRS. You know, I have a question. Why is it called the Internal Revenue Service? How is having your money confiscated a service?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time' magazine found a picture of President Obama at his high school prom, back in 1979. Show the picture. I love this picture. ... The theme of the prom was 'Hope and change out of that dress into something more comfortable,' I believe. See, that was back in 1979. Let me tell you how long ago that was. Back then, Obama had to ask a girl for her phone number. He couldn't illegally obtain it through the Justice Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's coming out that in high school, President Obama signed a girl's yearbook by calling her 'sweet and foxy.' ... Of course, now he calls her Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. He didn't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This latest California wildfire is getting pretty scary. ... But Governor Jerry Brown, God bless him, he's got it under control.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says he's renewing his efforts to close Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay? How about closing the IRS? ... In fact, how about shipping the IRS to Guantanamo Bay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems with the IRS. A new report has found that they spent $50 million on employee conferences and retreats in just two years. They would have investigated sooner, but it turns out, you know, they don't belong to any conservative groups, so nobody really knows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two members of Congress have sent letters to the owner of the Washington Redskins asking them to change the name of the team because it's offensive. You really want to make it less offensive? Take out the word 'Washington.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know actor Steven Seagal? He is now in Russia, meeting with Vladimir Putin. Is this what American foreign policy has come down to now? Dennis Rodman's in North Korea, Steven Seagal is in Russia. What is next? Are we air-dropping Gary Busey into Syria? Maybe Snooki goes to Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party suffered a real setback this past week when one of their leading vote-getters decided to call it quits. But enough about Michele Bachmann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've probably heard Michele Bachmann has decided not to run for re-election in 2014. Well, with Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann both gone, Republican leaders have no idea who's gonna drive their party off a cliff in the next election. This is going to be a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see, we got scandals going on and the IRS - now, the IRS apparently spent a lot of our tax dollars on lavish vacations and parties. Bunch of accountants going crazy. I don't have a problem with that. That's fine with me. There's a little box on your return there. You check the box if you want to spend a dollar so idiots can go dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week President Obama is going to be engaged in high-level talks with the president of China. ... Yes, President Obama's message to China is going to be, 'I swear we'll have the money for you by Tuesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his trip to Brazil on Friday, Joe Biden said that he was having such a good time that he didn't want to go home. And that was just while he was riding on the baggage carousel at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Republicans want President Obama to fire Attorney General Eric Holder after he seemed to contradict himself under oath. When asked if he was worried, Holder said, 'Yes. I mean, no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One beleaguered government bureau, the IRS, spent the week further mired in a scandal that stems from accusations that its agents particularly targeted right-wing groups for scrutiny. Oh, no! Poor babies. The IRS facing scrutiny. People getting all up in their business, checking their books just because one small area of their business raised a couple of red flags. Now, everybody at the IRS has to stop their lives and prove their innocence. Excellent. Or perhaps we can put that in terms the IRS might understand themselves. It's our new segment, 'Where's Your Receipts, [bleep]hole?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sucks to get audited, doesn't it? Suddenly, actions that seem harmless can be painted in a nefarious light. Well, why don't we get started? ? Having the President to tell you to use the power of the IRS to destroy his political enemies on the right should really only take about one meeting, two tops. The first meeting will be like, 'Hey, why don't you target my political enemies?' Then, the next 156 you're like, 'Did you take care of that thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can't a government agency sit around the table picking names of seniors out of a hat to see who needs to die so that it can save enough money to give elementary school children their birth control, without everyone getting all 'What's going on in there?' Yeah, welcome to Audit World, IRS. By the way, Kevin Costner's second worst movie. It is a time on earth. Man lives in a city of forms. It's a world drowning in paperwork. See, that's the problem with auditing IRS. You may have perfectly reasonable explanations for every action that you took. That doesn't mean we don't need you to go back home and dig through another couple of shoe boxes until we get one document that we really need to see before we can be okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more problems for the IRS. Good. Isn't that just the feel-good story of the year? It seems the agency wasted $50 million over a two-year period on conferences and retreats for employees. It was revealed today, they even spent $11,000 on a happiness expert. You know, I got an idea how to make them happier. How about stopping making everybody else's life miserable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems an IRS executive named Lois Lerner - you probably saw her testifying - has refused to quit, and she will collect her full pay and benefits while she is on administrative leave. The IRS asked her to resign. She has refused to go. See, where in the real world does that ever happen? You get fired. And you tell your boss, 'I'm gonna stay, and I want my money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that IRS, huh? Now listen to this. The IRS - and we know what they do - they weasel you and they screw you and they take your money. And that's the price we pay for the great life we have here in the United States. We have to put up with the weasely IRS cheating and screwing us out of our hard-earned money. Guess what they have been doing with our tax dollars? They've been throwing themselves lavish parties. Well, on the other hand, what good is it being a bunch of power-hungry, jack-booted drones if you can't enjoy yourselves - if you can't every now and then pat yourself on the back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, the IRS is working now on regaining trust - trust! Regaining trust! Nobody ever trusted the IRS! We don't care, they're weasels. Nobody trusted them. Regaining trust. Ha!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Michele Bachmann? Who was from Minnesota, running for President? She has announced that she will not seek reelection. She says she wants to spend more time now listening to the voices in her head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that Al Qaeda actually has a complaints department. It's true. Seems crazy, but we were actually able to get our hands on some of those complaint cards. Here's the first one, here: 'The price limits for corporate dinners should be increased to three goats; I've got deals I need to close.' And this one, here: 'I'm declaring a jihad on the person who keeps stealing my lunch from the break room fridge.' And here's the last one: 'Not to be that guy, but whatever happened to guacamole Friday?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get to some serious questions on the international scene. People asking if the United States should become involved in the war in Syria. Slow down, America. Remember, our troops are still in Afghanistan and we still haven't figured out for sure who won The Iraq War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq, you awarded all your oil contracts to China. Iraq, I mean come on, man. We launched a sustained shock-and-awe bombing campaign on your country. We reduced your already stressed infrastructure to rubble and unleashed sectarian conflict that even now costs your country hundreds of lives per month. And this is how you repay us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China thinks, 'Oh, we spent $2 billion, rebuilding Iraqi infrastructure.' Big [bleep] deal! When we were in Iraq, we spent $2 billion just looking for the other $9 billion we lost. Apparently, we shipped it to Iraq in a container that said ' $9 billion' and someone ran off with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

But even with their top obstructionists, things were bound to fall through the cracks. An elementary school gets named. A bridge gets fixed up. Expanded healthcare coverage gets passed. But since that slip-up, the House has voted to repeal or defund Obamacare 37 times. Not because they're stubborn - they have no short-term memories. It's covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner?recently announced that he is running for mayor of New York City. And now he's looking for interns to work in his campaign. We actually got a hold of some of his interview questions, and it seems like he's mostly concerned about one thing. Take a look: 'Do you use Twitter? Do you know how to remove things from Twitter? Can you remove something right now, if I were to show you something I accidentally put on Twitter, from Twitter? Do you know how to make it so I can't take pictures on my phone? ... You answer those questions, you've got a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama has called on Congress to pass a media shield law which would allow reporters to do their job without fear of government prosecution. Yeah, we have that. It's called the First Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CNN, former Senator John Edwards now planning to open a new law firm this fall. John Edwards going back to work as an attorney. I guess, he figured he's lying so much already he might as well start getting paid for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A huge honor, a huge honor - this Friday the President of China will be right here in California. He says the purpose of his visit is to strengthen Chinese ties with the Mexican people. So, that's exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story in Washington today, an English newspaper called 'The Guardian' is reporting that the National Security Agency...here in the United States obtained a secret court order that forces Verizon to hand over phone records for millions of their customers who made calls between the months of April and July. They know who called and when, if you're a Verizon customer, which I was totally against this, until I got an anonymous call reminding me it was my dad's birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Obama Administration has not confirmed the court order does exist. But a senior official said that it would only be used to collect data that could protect America from terrorism. And so Michelle Obama can keep tabs on how many times we call Pizza Hut. So, in case you're wondering, the answer is, yes, they can hear you now. Kind of scary, right? Don't think of it as the NSA spying on you. Try to think of them as part of your family plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, and I've never said this before about a politician, especially a mayor of New York City. I think the guy running this city, Mayor Bloomberg, I think this guy is a genius. He has turned this town into a wonderland. You know what I'm talking about? You know the potholes all over New York City? Some of them are enormous. There's one on 8th Avenue that actually has a gift shop at the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big heads of state meeting tomorrow in California. Chinese President Xi Jinping?meeting with President Obama tomorrow. And then Saturday he meets with Dennis Rodman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the Verizon phone records news) &quot;It has been a tough week for Obama. This comes on the heels of the IRS scandal. Before that was Benghazi. Even the crack-head mayor of Toronto's like, 'Rough week, eh?' ? Next we'll find out Obama was somehow behind last week's 'Game of Thrones' wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress have both come out in defense of collecting this data. And as every good American knows, when Democrats and Republicans agree on something in Congress it is time to be very, very worried, indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress actually gave the White House authority to spy on phones under President Bush. But experts say cell phone snooping actually goes as far back as the Clinton Administration. But it wasn't organized back then. It was just Bill Clinton calling up women, 'What are you wearing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, the National Security Agency is spying on our phone calls, and unlike during the Bush Administration, this time it's the Obama Administration. ... This guy, he is always trying to outdo his predecessor. 'Oh, he poured water on their face? I'm going to blow 'em up. Did I win?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, according to the UK's 'Guardian,' the newspaper, Verizon's business services division was ordered by the FBI to deliver millions of customers' 'telephony metadata.' Now, that's a lot of jargon, so let me break it down for you. Metadata means information about a call's length, location, and participants. Telephony is what a two-year-old calls a telephone. And believe me, Obama knows all about the calls between Betsy and Puppy Wuppy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, I'm going to be straight with you. I'm conflicted here, folks. On the one hand, this proves Obama is a tyrannical despot who ignores all the rules. On the other hand, I kind of like tyrannical despots who break all the rules. Shows spunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then again, I do think the Obama Administration has a point when they call this program 'a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States,' and not just because anyone who has dealt with Verizon's customer service wants to kill someone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another scandal at the White House. It turns out there's a new?report out that the government has been secretly collecting the phone records of Verizon customers since April. ... I knew something was up when I was, like, 'You hang up first.' And then my wife is, like 'No, you hang up first.' And then Obama was like, 'How about you just hang up at the same time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Security Agency has been collecting the phone records of Verizon since April, which explains Verizon's new ad campaign: 'They can hear you now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report shows the Obama Administration has been collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon under a top-secret court order. Here's the sad part. Turns out 90% of phone calls Americans make are to order a pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of China is coming to the United States tomorrow. He is going to meet with President Obama. To make him feel at home, they are going to meet at a Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's come out that the government has been secretly collecting telephone records of millions of Verizon customers. Yeah, or as Verizon is calling it, 'The friends and family and Obama plan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio will vote against his own immigration bill. In fact, he's now gone so far to the right, he's introducing a bill to deport himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to recent sexual misconduct in the military, Senator John McCain is suggesting women avoid serving altogether. Yeah, McCain added, 'And if they really want to play it safe, they might also want to stop working and voting. Just a suggestion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Snoop is back in the news. Not Snoop Dogg, Snoop Obama. Yeah, Snoop Obama. A big change at the White House, today. They closed the gift shop and opened a Verizon store.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this has become a huge controversy, after it was revealed that the National Security Agency seized millions of Verizon phone records. And of course this has caused a panic among the civil libertarians, constitutional scholars and cheating husbands everywhere. How ironic is that? We wanted a President that listens to all Americans. Now we have one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama clarified the situation today. He said no one is listening to your phone calls. The President said it's not what the program is all about. You know, like the IRS is not about targeting certain political groups. That's not what it's about!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean what's going on? The White House is listening to our phone records, checking our computers, monitoring our emails. When did the government suddenly become our psycho ex-girlfriend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'll tell you - if Obama wants to put this snooping thing to good use, how about spying on the IRS next time they throw a $4 million party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying the IRS paid an artist $17,000 to paint portraits of Abraham Lincoln to help inspire the IRS agents. You know, if they want to see a picture of Lincoln for inspiration, take out a $5 bill and save the taxpayers $16,995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the hearings have been unbelievable this week. Congressional investigators say the IRS basically threw a $4 million party for themselves. But in fairness, who else is going to throw a party for the IRS? ... Now, a going away party - I think we'd all chip in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, in the wake of this whole IRS scandal, there's now talk of abolishing our 74,000-page tax code and replacing it with a flat tax. See, with a flat tax you could fit your entire return on a postcard and just mail it in. Unless you're Mitt Romney. Then you mail in a blank postcard that says 'Greetings from the Cayman Islands,' and you send that in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're predicting that the US debt could double in 15 years, unless Congress acts. Unless Congress acts. You know what that means? The US debt is going to double in 15 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was visiting a middle school yesterday, and while he was there, he said every school in the US should have high-speed Internet. And then it got awkward when one kid said, 'What, so you could read our emails faster?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, we had Russell Crowe on the other night. He played Superman's father. And it's a great story. When Superman's dad realizes that his son is gifted with x-ray vision and super hearing, he puts him in a rocket and sends him towards earth. Because he knows, with those powers, he can get a job with the Obama Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, 'The Guardian' newspaper in England reported that a 29-year-old former technical assistant to the CIA named Edward Snowden leaked the story that the Federal government was collecting phone records from Verizon customers. Yeah. Snowden says you're being watched. To which NBC executives said, 'Finally.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said no one is listening to your phone calls. He said no one in the government is listening to your phone calls. And you know, I believe the President. Have you ever called a government agency? The person on the other end is never listening!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, now a lot of people are asking how this Snowden guy could download all this classified information and give it to a British newspaper without the NSA knowing about it. I think I know the answer. If you don't want the NSA spying on you, get a job working at the NSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, a group of web developers say they have developed an app that protects cell-phone users from having their calls and texts tracked. In fact, reporters want to schedule an interview with these developers, but they were mysteriously killed in a drone strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and the President of China met over the weekend in Palm Springs. It was a critically important meeting, because Obama is the leader of the most powerful country in the world, and the Chinese president holds the mortgage on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the story is the NSA has been listening in on telephone calls and spying on us. ? I want them to know everything about me. Today, I sent them a list of my sizes. Let's go. Here, take that! It's people with cell phones, and you hear these people, and maybe we have some in the audience, walking down the street screaming into their cell phone. You can hear them in all five boroughs. Those are the ones upset with people listening to their phone calls. Come on, really!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know your phone is being tapped when you're having a conversation and you hear the Attorney General breathing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the guy, the whistleblower, is all over TV. You see the guy? His name is Edward Snowden. He's very pleased with himself. Good for him. He says he doesn't want to live in a society where the society monitors its people. And then he fled to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my problem. I sometimes feel desperately alone, and the idea that somebody is spying on me and keeping track of everything I do - makes me feel good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some political news, this weekend President Obama held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It went well. Although it got awkward when Obama asked China to stop spying on America. And Jinping was like, 'You first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard about this last week - it was revealed that the National Security Agency spied on Americans' phone records and Internet history for years. And yesterday, the source of the leak, former CIA employee Edward Snowden - sounds like a 'Game of Thrones' character - Edward Snowden came forward. He said that he's hiding out in Hong Kong. Marking the first time anyone has ever said, 'I don't want to be punished by the government so I'm going to China.' To China? To avoid government persecution? It's like going to Ireland to avoid getting drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver [hosting &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for the summer]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, it turns out the government is monitoring vastly more information than even George Orwell wet the bed over, which brings us to our new segment. 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid,' is brought to you by tin foil. Why not wear it as a hat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to a bespectacled whistleblower, we now know that the government has been actively collecting an unprecedented amount of information on a small select group of us who either make phone calls or use the Internet. I'm going to say I bet the Amish are feeling pretty [bleep] smug right now. Or they would be feeling that way, if they had any idea that this story was happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you're misunderstanding the perceived problem here, Mr. President. No one is saying that you broke any laws. We're just saying it's a little bit weird that you didn't have to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Behold the face of evil. His name is Edward Snowden, and he's an employee of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, named, of course, after our drunkest founding father. Now, Snowden has fled to a Hong Kong hotel room where the minibar has been stocked with 'Not Poison Brand-Actual Beer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'll tell you, I might be the only one saying this, but I think I know what's really going on here. 'The Guardian' says that Snowden had a very comfortable life that included a salary of roughly $200,000 and a girlfriend with whom he shared a home in Hawaii. Nation, I think this could be the most passive-aggressive break-up in history. 'Honey, of course I'm into you. Yes, I want children. But first, I just have to leak a little information about the NSA and hide out in Asia for the rest of my life. This isn't about us. I'll be back as soon as I'm sure I won't be murdered by the Hong Kong triads.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but things are pretty messed up in the Middle East. Whether it's Syria, Iran, Libya Egypt, Iraq, or Syria again. Apparently, new violence broke out while I was listing those other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Tim Tebow has signed with the New England Patriots. ... Apparently, Tebow sat down and told Bill Belichick about his friend, Jesus. And Belichick told Tim about his friend, Satan, and they came to an agreement. ... Oh, nobody knew about this. This was a top secret deal. Nobody had any idea. The only people who knew were Bill Belichick, Tim Tebow and, of course, the NSA because they were, you know, listening in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the good news - Tim Tebow got a job with the Patriots. The bad news - now that he's associated with the word 'Patriot,' he's being audited by the IRS.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody else have this problem? I've got Verizon, and I just found out I've gotten way more people on my friends and family plan than I thought I had. There's hundreds of people involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are really up in arms about this NSA spying thing. You know, if the government really wants to follow our every move, do what everybody else does. Stalk us on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand the scope of this? They're monitoring 3 billion phone calls a day. Not to mention tweets, emails and texts. How do they do that? ... I can't keep up with my DVR, okay? ... I'm still on season two of 'Mad Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy who blew the whistle on this whole scandal is a former NSA security worker named Edward Snowden. In an interview, Snowden said he did what he did because 'I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.' Why can't we get the Kardashians to realize this, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snowden said he did this because he mistakenly believed in President Obama's promises. And now, the government wants to extradite him. The Justice Department wants to charge him. And Fox News wants to give him his own show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about this guy. It seems Edward Snowden is a high school dropout. He was making $122,000 a year. He lived in Hawaii. He was engaged to a beautiful former ballerina. And he gave it all up. So, not only is he a whistle-blower, he's also a moron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always love when politicians say things like this. President Obama said today he welcomes a national debate over our surveillance policies. He said that's a debate we wouldn't have had five years ago. Five years ago? It's a debate we wouldn't have had two weeks ago, if they all hadn't gotten caught. That's why we're having the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now, another potential scandal growing. It seems CBS News reporting may have uncovered documents that the State Department may have covered up that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail - not her - the guys in the security detail - may have engaged with prostitutes while on official business. Boy, it's bad time for President Obama, isn't it? I mean, even stories that involve a happy ending don't have a happy ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the State Department, listen to this. And the United States ambassador to Belgium, a guy named Howard Gutman, has allegedly, now, been inviting call girls up to the embassy. Yup. I think I speak for everyone who's ever been to Belgium when I say, 'So what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw it last night, but let me just apologize. We had a bad show last night. I will tell you how bad the show was last night - halfway through, the White House stopped listening in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll, the majority of Americans are OK with the Obama Administration listening in on our phone calls. Guys approve, because they feel it increases security. And women approve of Obama's policy, because finally a man is listening to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More information coming out about the whistleblower, the guy who started this scandal, Edward Snowden. His girlfriend apparently is a pole dancer. I guess that settles the debate about whether or not he's a hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Speaker John Boehner called Eric Snowden a traitor. But only because he leaked the name of his tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marco Rubio announced a new bill that would require immigrants to learn English to become citizens. Many Americans already say it's the goodest news they have heard all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is big. Hillary Clinton finally joined Twitter yesterday. She racked up more than 200,000 followers in only five hours. Yep. There were [tweets] like 'Hillary in 2016' and 'Washington needs Hillary.' 'Hillary for the White House.' That's not her followers, but those were her tweets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton sent her first tweet yesterday, or as one guy put it, [as Bill Clinton ] 'How do you block people on this thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw this week marks the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act. Men were like, 'Can you believe it's been 50 years of equal pay?' And women were like, 'No.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, we continue our coverage of the NSA scandal with our ongoing segment, 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid'. 'Good News, You're Not Paranoid' is brought to you by blankets. Cower under them for the illusion of safety. Blankets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, we've learned that the NSA program is technically legal, probably useful, and yet has the potential to do great harm. They're like bath salts. Good to relax in, less good to shove into your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's what really hurts about this story. It makes us pick between liberty and convenience. I love my privacy, but I also love to buy movie tickets on the toilet. Don't make me choose. Don't make me choose. It's too hard. I want both. I want both so bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guns are one thing, but phone calls are too dangerous to go unchecked. Think about it. Really think about it. Some maniac could be calling about going on a shooting spree. You know what this means? You know what this actually means? At 11:09 p.m., on June 11, the Second Amendment has won the Bill of Rights. It has defeated all the other amendments. Which, of course, it did - when you think about it - it's the only amendment with a [bleep] gun. It actually seems pretty clear. If you don't want the government tracking your phone, there is only one solution. Gun phones. What could possibly go wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NSA surveillance program called PRISM, haven't heard of it? It's heard of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, let's get straight to the story everyone's talking about. The NSA knows what everyone's talking about. And according to stunning new articles first published by friend of the show and professional blabbermouth Glenn Greenwald in the UK's 'The Guardian' the newspaper, the NSA is also engaging in cybersnooping. ? Now, this betrayal of our national security comes courtesy of former CIA technical assistance and nerd trying to look like a cool guy trying to look like a nerd Edward Snowden. Snowden leaked a top secret PowerPoint presentation that detailed how the government gathers massive amounts of information on everything but graphic design.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This secret program's name, PRISM, is an acronym for Planning Tool for Resource Integration Synchronization and Management. Incidentally, for revealing PRISM, Snowden may soon be in PRISON, for Probably Regretting Identifying Self on National TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's popular now? George W. Bush. ... According to recent polls, George W. Bush is more popular than not popular. ... It's because a couple of months ago, George W. Bush opened up his new George W. Bush presidential library and water park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts believe the reason George W. Bush is more popular now,,,is put up to a rare medical disorder known as 'forgetting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is some sad news. Scarlett Johansson is denying reports that she'll play Hillary Clinton in an upcoming movie. ? Nobody is more disappointed than Bill Clinton. He was hoping to play himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we begin tonight with the ever-growing list of scandals that has befallen this great nation. There was the IRS targeting conservative groups, the DOJ spying on journalists, the NSA creeping on everyone, and, recently, God's controversial decision to ruin the New England Patriots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the NSA leak story) &quot;This government spy scandal is huge. Due to the government spy scandal, sales of the classic George Orwell book '1984' have skyrocketed. So, the fallout is worse than we thought - it's making Americans read. That's frightening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immigration, also a big story. Senator Marco Rubio has proposed a measure requiring that all immigrants must know English. Opposing the bill are immigrant rights groups, civil rights advocates, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hispanic Senator Ted Cruz, who is fighting the immigration bill, described himself as Obamaphobic. You know you have Obamaphobia, if you'll deport immigrants even though your last name is Cruz.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this guy Edward Snowden? Do you know anything about this guy? This guy shows up in a hotel in Hong Kong and he says, 'Send up a videotape crew.' Then he announces to the world that he's leaked confidential National Security Agency memos and documents. He's compromised the security of the free world, and now he's gone. He checks out of the hotel at Hong Kong. He's gone. Where is this guy? He could be a hero. ... Where is Edward Snowden? Gosh, if only there were a way to keep track of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the difference. When people's privacy is violated, it's illegal surveillance. I think we can all agree on that. When your privacy is violated, illegal surveillance. When people violate their own privacy, that's Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of scary, you guys. There was this guy, a crazy guy. He was arrested for jumping over the White House fence and trying to spray paint a political message. ... If that guy really wanted to get a message to the President, he should have just written it in an email to literally anyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the White House's surveillance program has been exposed, some of President Obama's celebrity supporters seem to be turning on him. ... Actually, one celebrity who isn't happy with the President, is actor John Cusack. ... He went on Twitter to criticize the President over recent scandals. Of course, it's going to be awkward when Obama tries to win him back and he's like: 'In your eyes, the light, the heat. Your eyes are complete?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. It continues to be this 29-year-old Edward Snowden guy. The man behind the leaking of the story of the NSA spy scandal. A lot of speculation about this guy. One of them now is, that Snowden is hiding in Hong Kong and could be working for China. Hey, let's get real, okay? Aren't we all pretty much working for China?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they say Snowden also leaked the fact that the NSA has access to top Internet websites like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. So the lesson here: If you don't want the government watching you, go on Myspace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, some experts believe that this privacy scandal will hurt the NSA. Do you think it'll hurt it? What, are you crazy? You know how many people wanna join now? Especially when I heard a guy who blew the whistle was a high-school dropout, making almost $200,000 a year with a pole-dancer girlfriend, and he's living in Hawaii? People are lined up to get this job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a Gallup poll out today, President Obama's approval rating has dropped to 45%. Only 45% of Americans now approve of the job he's doing. Luckily for Obama, he has impeachment insurance. It's called Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate is getting closer and closer to passing a sweeping immigration bill. In fact, given how wide-sweeping this immigration bill is, if it passes, you'll press one for Spanish and two for English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm excited this Sunday's Father's Day, because I'm a dad. ... I don't know what I'm getting yet. But I have a feeling the government knows.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edward Snowden, he's the 29-year-old guy behind this NSA spy scandal. He said in a new interview that he is not in hiding. Which would have carried a lot more weight if he hadn't made the announcement from an undisclosed secret location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin said there should be a full investigation of both the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat. And then, somebody told her, 'No, it's the NSA. Not the NBA.' So she got a little confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is a good idea. Instead of having the government looking into terrorists, why don't we hire the paparazzi? Think about this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is traveling to Africa later this month, and people are upset&quot; because &quot;the trip is expected to cost taxpayers more than $60 million. ... Mostly for security, hotel accommodations - and Biden wants a giraffe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said that she will spend the next few years focusing on economic issues. When asked what she planned on doing after that, Clinton was like, 'Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ever since the government's spying scandal was exposed, sales of the novel '1984,' have jumped 6,000% on Amazon. ... '1984' shows how scary it would be if a society tracked everything you did. And if you want to read it, you just buy it on a website that tracks everything you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Putin takes look at it, puts it in his pocket, good-bye! ? So, now it turns out that the owner would like his Super Bowl ring back. He even offered to trade Tim Tebow for the ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that the President's approval rating dropped eight points in the last month. Based on how he's done so far, we can actually see what Obama's future ratings will be and the reasons why they may go up or down. It's pretty incredible. Let's take a look. Next week, his approval ratings will go up three points. Let's see why. Obama makes it illegal for your friends to post photos of their babies on Facebook. That makes sense. In July, his ratings will drop five points. Let's see why. Obama hires Miss Utah as his speechwriter. ... And finally in August, his approval rating will rise 12 points. Let's see why. Obama appoints Ryan Gosling as Secretary of Handsome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has just named an executive at HBO as the new ambassador to Spain. You can tell he's an HBO exec, because when asked how he would improve relations with Spain, he was like, 'Uh, sex and dragons?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, well, well. Look what the Fox dragged in. Sarah Palin has been hired back by Fox News, and she only left five months ago. She's now effectively quit quitting. ? This is brings us to our new incredibly important segment. 'Wait a Second. We Can Just Ignore Her.' We can all do that. That is a power we have. Because, yes, we could spend the whole show juxtaposing video clips to demonstrate how Sarah Palin's strongly-felt convictions are nothing more than self-contradictory nonsense. Or, we can just ignore her. We can respond to her obvious trolling with a series of insulting jokes, and maybe together enjoy a brief moment of catharsis, or we can just [bleep] ignore her. I promise, America, it will feel so good. It will be like we give our brains an enema together. I'm not saying it will be easy. I mean, just look at her. She's a temptress. Oh, Sarah, if only it was as easy for us to quit you as it is for you to quit everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about this big government surveillance scandal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Congress in a three-way tie for least popular branch of government. However, they may be about to accomplish - and I know it sounds improbable - something, specifically, immigration reform, which suddenly has support even from Republicans. [As Lindsey Graham] 'And I, Lindsey Graham, say to you the Hispanic community, we choose to help you not because we want to but because mathematically we feel we have to.' ? So, Democrats are on board, but Republicans may take a little more convincing.

It paid its hard-earned political capital to a gang of not entirely reliable Toyotas to cross the legislative desert, only to navigate the perilous waters of debate hoping it can evade the dreaded filibuster patrol. But after all that, it's safe and there will be nothing stopping immigration reform from starting its brand new life in America. ? Oh, yeah. That's right. The House of Representatives. A thousand-foot high border fence built out of ignorance and spite.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Germany's actually always been good to President Obama. Back in 2008, before he was even president, 200,000 Germans turned up to hear him speak. A measurement known in Germany as half a Hasselhoff concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama's approval rating has dropped eight points over the past month, down to 45%, his lowest in more than a year-and-a-half.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, some critics are now arguing that as fast and widespread as this whole NSA spying program is, it's been ineffective at retrieving useful information.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the FBI admitted they do use drones on US soil for domestic surveillance. Well, the FBI Chief, Robert Mueller, told Congress he does sometimes use drones. But he said the good news is these drones are made in America by Americans to spy on Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Obama gave a big speech on climate change. He believes global warming is getting worse, because apparently he's sweating a lot more during his second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a radio interview, Pat Buchanan predicted that the inflow of Hispanics from the immigration bill will break the US into two countries with different cultures and different languages.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, everyone wants to know where he is. Now they're saying he's been living in the Moscow airport for two days. Not because he's a fugitive, but because he's flying United.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, basically the key part of the Voting Rights Act they [SCOTUS] removed was the one that applied strict scrutiny to states with a previous history of racial discrimination, those states, of course, being White-sylvania, Pale-afornia, and Mississippi. We're good, we're good then. Because things have changed. We have got iPads, Twitter, everyone is allergic to bread now, and racially things have got better in the South. It's true, primarily because of things like, oh, I don't know, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Do you remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, not only didn't it [the Farm Bill] cut enough spending, it also cut too much spending. It's like the bill was Goldilocks and the first bear says, 'I think your food stamp cuts are too low.' And the second bear says, 'I think your food stamp cuts are too high.' And instead of there being a moderate bear, the first two bears tear Goldilocks limb from limb and eat her. That's basically what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, I've been paying pretty close attention to the Supreme Court, which just today overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which required the Jim Crow states to get Federal permission before changing any of their voting laws. Thankfully, Chief Justice John Roberts, Old Blue Eyes, knows that the South doesn't need to be babysat anymore, saying, quote, 'Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.' Yes, for some reason since the Voting Rights Act was passed, things have changed dramatically. Therefore, we can get rid of it now. It's just like those outdated labor laws that prohibit children from threading bobbins on a loom. A kid hasn't been sucked into one of those machines in years. Let's stop playing nanny here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court handed down the decision on same-sex marriage today. Until this morning, marriage was defined as a contract between one man, one woman and the producers of 'The Bachelor,' but that is no longer the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a five-to-four vote, the court struck down a major provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied benefits to married gay couples. So now, every adult American over the age of 18 must spend at least two years in a same-sex marriage. Go to GayDate.org to meet your potential mates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court also considered Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage here in California. The court ruled that Prop. 8 supporters didn't have the right to repeal the reversal last year, which means next month, same-sex marriage will once again be legal in this state. The only catch is gays will be required to use straight wedding planners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elsewhere in Washington, there's another scandal brewing within the IRS. An internal watch group claimed some IRS workers used agency credit cards to buy a wide variety of seemingly inappropriate things. One IRS employee reportedly charged more than $2,500 worth of diet pills, romance novels and steaks to the IRS. I don't know who that person is, but sounds like they might have a sadder life than Bruce Jenner, even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cards from the agency were also used to buy kazoos, bath toys, a popcorn machine, stuffed animals and Nerf footballs. Is the IRS running an underground Chucky Cheese and we don't know about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Edward Snowden guy? He had a job in Hawaii and he was stealing secrets, and then he gave them to a guy and he published the secrets, and he said, 'I'm leaving Hawaii, I'll go to Hong Kong.' Gets tired of the food, and he says, 'You know what, I'm going to Moscow,' and nobody's heard from him since. We think he's still in Moscow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional. And once someone explains this to me, I'm sure I'll be thrilled about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next issue for the Supreme Court is defense of the Kardashian marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Defense of Marriage Act is dead. ... Traditional marriage is now as defenseless as a freshman frat pledge about to go through the spanking machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I for one cannot believe the court threw out DOMA. It was passed in 1996 to guarantee that traditional marriage was between one man and one woman for the sacred purpose of getting Bill Clinton re-elected. Listen, folks, to their so-called judicial reasoning: 'DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of liberty of persons that is protected under the Fifth Amendment.' Oh, please. I find it hard to believe that there are amendments after the Second. Sounds made up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, folks, you know what this means? If DOMA is unconstitutional, that means the Constitution is gay. Of course, I mean, no real shocker. It was written by a bunch of dudes in wigs and tights in the City of Brotherly Love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about striking down DOMA is it doesn't affect any state's right to ban or to allow same-sex marriage. ... Here's how it works. You're married in New York. You're not married in Alabama. What gives? I'm as confused as a freshman frat pledge who really enjoyed that spanking machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act decision) &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as a son of the South, from one of the states covered by the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, I want to thank the Supreme Court for finally setting my people free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, in his decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice Roberts sagely noted something many of us had apparently missed about discrimination, saying, quote, 'nearly 50 years later things have changed dramatically.' True. For instance, there used to be a Voting Rights Act. But we don't need it now, because apparently racism is over. Now I can do anything I want and no one can call it racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act. ... In fact, Bill Clinton hailed the court decision today, even though he signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law. But in fairness to Clinton, he didn't totally understand the law. When he signed the bill, he thought the Defense of Marriage Act was defending marriage as if it were really just an act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the NSA leaker, Edward Snowden, is reportedly held up in Moscow's international airport. See, technically, he's not in Russia, because he's in an international area. Yeah. Kind of like being in L.A. Technically, you're not really in America. But it's kind of like being in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama personally called and talked to the two lesbians who helped legalize gay marriage in California. Yeah. It was awkward at first, because the women had to put Bill Clinton on hold. Apparently he calls them constantly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The whole point of the Supreme Court is to keep us in check. Sometimes, we as a nation make bad decisions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is, whether or not we get our hands on Edward Snowden any time soon has no bearing on the fact that he is currently screwed. He's in a foreign airport, waiting on a flight that may or may not even exist. As ironic punishments go, that is almost Twilight Zone-level. So, enjoy your meals of tariff-free vodka and Toblerones, Mr. Snowden, because you have checked into the Russian equivalent of the 'Hotel California.' Oh, you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Supreme Court opened the door for same-sex marriage to resume in California. Apparently, the judges are really swayed by that Liberace movie. They said, 'Oh God. Matt Damon and Michael Douglas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, because the Obama Administration and the Justice Department refused to defend it in court. So, it was up to the House of Representatives to defend it. Well, you could see why they lost, come on. A bunch of congressmen defending marriage? Huh? That's like the makers of Mad Dog 20/20 defending Alcoholics Anonymous. It's not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is currently on a week-long trip to Africa, where he'll promote freedom, democracy and economic opportunity. I guess he figured it hasn't worked out here, so we'll try it somewhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer - remember him? He announced he is running for New York City controller, and one of his opponents is the madam who supplied him with hookers. She is running against him. There's a tough choice for the voters, huh? I mean, one is involved in the most degrading profession of all time, and the other ran a...house [of prostitution].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal prosecutors say an immigration officer in Santa Ana, California...has been indicted on charges that she took 200 egg rolls as a bribe from an immigrant seeking citizenship and a green card. She took 200 egg rolls. In fact, she would have gotten away with this crime, but she got greedy and made the guy go back for the little soy sauce packets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, I'm surprised about Eliot Spitzer running for city comptroller. Because...this guy couldn't even comp-trol himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next presidential election is still like three years away. They're already starting. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were in Africa last week. They were there on a humanitarian visit. And this to me is the worst part about being president. It's not deciding whether to send troops to war or the daily scrutiny or the schedule. Worst part of being president, I think, is being forced to dance with villagers. Imagine if Lincoln had to do this? He wouldn't be on money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Edward Snowden, the super spy Edward Snowden? And he's working for the NSA and he says 'You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to download some stuff and sneak it around.' He's in Hawaii. Pretty good gig, Hawaii staring at a computer all day. Then he says, 'I'm tired of Hawaii; I'm going to Hong Kong.' Then he goes to Hong Kong and he gets tired of the food. So he says, 'I know what I'll do; I'll go to Russia and then I'll go to somewhere else. So he's been in Russia now for about a month living at the airport right there at the Marriott gulag. And so finally Venezuela said, 'Okay, you can come to Venezuela.' But he also got some more great news today. Look at this, Edward Snowden. Cinnabon customer of the month at the Moscow airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out the Pakistan police pulled this guy over for speeding, pulled Osama bin Laden over for speeding. Pulled him over and wrote the guy a ticket.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know anything about the local political scene in New York City but the politics are crazy. We have Eliot Spitzer former governor wants to be comptroller and we have Anthony Weiner, former congressman wants to be mayor. And it's gotten crazy and it looks to me like Eliot Spitzer is going to be the new comptroller of New York City. How many of you feel better knowing that he will be comp-trolling things? I just hope he can comp-troll himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Political experts are saying that Joe Biden needs to start doing more fundraising if he wants to run for President in 2016. A lot of people are saying they'd definitely donate to a Biden campaign. Most of them are Republicans, but still, they would definitely want to see him run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I heard that President Obama is getting a new limousine that will have advanced night vision capability. Yeah. The technology even has a cool name, it's called a headlight. We've been doing this for years, driving at night. Is that a big deal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some local news, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, who resigned five years ago after a prostitution scandal announced that he is running for New York City comptroller. Which is weird coming from a guy who had a hard time comp-trolling himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justin Bieber got into a lot of trouble because a video surfaced of Justin Bieber saying 'F Bill Clinton.' ? So, after the video surfaced, today Justin Bieber called to apologize to Bill Clinton. That's the latest. No word on when Bieber plans to call everybody who has heard his music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's approval rating is down to 44 percent. You can tell Obama's getting desperate, because today he gave a speech entitled 'Hey, Guys, The Twinkie's Coming Back, Next Week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night we showed a video, Justin Bieber in the kitchen of a restaurant in New York, peeing into a mop bucket and yelling 'F Bill Clinton.' It got a lot of attention. He actually called Bill Clinton to apologize. ? He tweeted about their conversation. He said, '@BillClinton, thank you for taking time to talk, hash tag.' You know it is sincere when there is a hash tag. Bieber reportedly offered to help President Clinton with his charity. Seems like they're on good terms, although at the end of the call it did get a little awkward, when Clinton asked for Selena Gomez's phone number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, TMZ posted this video of Justin Bieber. I guess he's urinating in a bucket. Yeah, and then he and his buddies are yelling that we're the wild kids. And then he shoots spray cleaner on a photo of Bill Clinton and he says 'F Bill Clinton.' And then he runs away like a wild kid would do. Into the wild, yes. It was not good. Anyways, well, last night Bieber actually called up Bill Clinton and apologized to him. Which I thought was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

In one text Jay-Z was like, 'What's it like being the most powerful person in the world?' And Obama was like, 'I don't know, ask Beyonce.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

He's got...the 4,000 signatures that he needs to qualify for the city comptroller race by hiring people on Craigslist to help him.

Not only that, but he never completed high school. Never finished high school, working for a contractor that works for the NSA, in Hawaii, with a stripper girlfriend. I mean, kids, think about finishing up school. Maybe not. When he's not busy with his girlfriend, he's downloading secrets and selling them around the world or something. I don't know. Then he goes to Hong Kong, and then he goes to Russia. Ultimately he wants asylum in Venezuela. That's all I know, but he also wants to be able to have summer asylum in the Hamptons.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So nearly half of all executive nominee filibusters ever have been to block Obama appointees. I've got to say, when they told us that this was going to be a historic presidency, I don't think this was really what everyone had in mind. Now, there are two reasons for this. One, Congress' innate rudeness. Two, under current rules all you need to do to filibuster is say, 'I'm going to filibuster.' You don't have to stand there for 15 hours, hold your pee, read the phone book. It's like a golfer standing at a tee and turning to his caddie and saying, 'I plan to hit a hole in one so why don't you just put me down for one. If you need me, I'll be in the bar high-fiving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about Edward Snowden? ... Now he's living at the Moscow airport. Anybody ever spent any time at the Moscow airport? You guys been there? I mean, it's crazy. He's been there for about a month. He's scorned. Edward Snowden, scorned. No home to call his own. No safe harbor.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, this Edward Snowden's been at the airport close to two months. And here's how he stays in shape. He goes jogging every day on the baggage carousel. Now that's a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can the House be expected to get anything done when many of the bills they vote on don't even repeal Obamacare? For instance, take the immigration reform bill. It is going nowhere in the House of Representatives because it is full of problems. Sure, it massively increases security on the Mexican border, but as Virginia representative and Nordstrom make-up counter victim, Bob Goodlatte points out, the bill 'overlooked the need for border agents in the interior of our country.' Yes, yes, thank you. Our interior borders are defenseless?When will we build the border wall with Florida? We cannot let those maniacs into our country. It is legal to shoot each other down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, just last week, the House of Representatives proved that they are not do-nothings by done didding something. They passed the farm bill. Now, that might not sound like much. Traditionally the farm bill is a routine piece of legislation which provides government subsidies for farmers while also setting aside money for food stamps. It's a win-win. Help for the folks who grow the corn, and help for folks who live on nothing but corn syrup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to the House's passing of a scaled-down farm bill) &quot;Yes, farm programs cannot wait. We need to grow the food that people can no longer afford to buy. See, Republicans showed they were willing to compromise by eliminating the part of the bill they refused to compromise on. It's just like a cardiologist who is having problems with a patient's heart. Instead of getting bogged down in complicated procedures, he simply removes the heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry, folks. Do not worry. House Republicans are absolutely going to pass funding for food stamps at some point. And when they don't, if people are still hungry, we'll just combine the food stamp program with the immigration program and let poor people eat Mexicans. The best part is?they are a healthy snack because they pick their own vegetables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elliot Spitzer is running for office again, and I've got to say, that is a bold move for man still living down the hideous, embarrassing, career-killing incident where he and a...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just came out that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?guess how much she gets paid to give one speech? $200,000, yeah, for one speech. Or as Men's Warehouse put it, cha-ching. A lot of pant suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Clintons, this is really cool.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, now she is running for the Senate in Wyoming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I've always been suspicious of the minimum wage. I've said it before. Minimum is a misnomer. $7.25? I can think of wages a lot lower. $3.28, $1.19, a pat on the back and a handful of mints. There are literally dozens of other things you could give them. A barn owl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when it comes to opposing the minimum wage, I'm in good company with guys who own companies. For example, billionaire industrialist and my future face twin, Charles Koch, in an interview with 'The Wichita Eagle,' said he wants to eliminate the minimum wage, because it creates a culture of dependency and keeps people with limited capital from starting their own business. He is right. Having to pay your employees really hurts small business. I mean, look at our nation's forefathers. Many arrived with nothing but the blouse on their back, but thanks to no minimum wage, they started a booming cotton industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study, lying gets easier over time. People get better at lying the more they do it. See, this is why we have term limits.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of lying, Anthony Weiner...is at it again. He admitted today in a press conference to having more online sexting episodes, well after he resigned from Congress. I love this. This time, Anthony Weiner used the name Carlos Danger. He was sexting women under the name Carlos Danger. See, this is Weiner's way of getting more Latino support. ? And you know something? As a comedian, I am pleading with the voters of New York, please elect this man. Please!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain is leading a group of lawmakers who want to permanently replace the dollar bill with a coin. You know, we already have a coin that replaces the dollar bill. It's called the nickel, okay? 'Cause that's what a dollar bill is worth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the TSA said beginning later this year, people can pay an $85 fee to allow you to go through the airport lines fast with minimal check-in. So, it's pretty much your choice: let the TSA reach into your wallet or reach down the front of your pants. Which one can you afford?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner, he was a Congressman here in New York. And it turned out when Congress was in recess, he would spend time photographing his reproductive organs. And then he would shoot those around to voters. So, then he resigned, and now he wants to be on the ticket for mayor. So, he's running for mayor now, and he says, 'All of this is behind me, and don't worry about it.' Well, today or yesterday, it turns out he may have been involved in some online activity under the name Carlos Danger. I-- I don't have a joke here. I just thought you'd like to know. ? Weiner apologized for this new scandal, I guess. And he apologized for the next one, and for the one after that, and then the one after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The royal baby was officially welcomed with a 62-gun salute. Because if there's one thing babies love, it's the sound of repeated artillery fire. Experts are predicting that the royal baby could pump $380 million into the British economy. $380 million. So, the question is, how do we get this kid to move to Detroit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has issued a statement about the royal baby. Even he's talking about it. ... He told him to hang on to the birth certificate. Those things come in handy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner is in trouble again. After his initial sex scandal, Anthony Wiener sent out more, apparently more, explicit pictures online under the alias Carlos Danger. At a press conference, he said. 'This will never happen again or my name isn't Carlos Danger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin the show, I want everyone to turn off their cell phones. Has nothing to do with our program. We just want to protect you from Anthony Weiner. He may try to send you a text.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner has been caught in yet another sexting scandal. You know, at the beginning of his campaign, he said that other texts and photos were likely to come out. Well, they have. Finally, a politician who keeps his promises. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner said yesterday he wants closure. You want closure, start with your zipper. Close your zipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration admitted this week that under Obamacare you might not be able to keep your doctor. First, the President guaranteed you would be able to keep your doctor. Now, they're saying you might be able to keep your doctor. In fact, today, the President was forced to change his slogan from 'Yes We Can' to 'Perhaps We Could Try. We can't promise anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in preparation for his next presidential run, Texas Governor Rick Perry announced that he is going to Israel. You know, I am not sure he is ready. When they asked about the West Bank, he said he keeps all his money in Wells Fargo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you right now, be prepared, the show tonight may run a little longer than usual, and I'll tell you why. We have about 300 Anthony Weiner jokes to get through. Let me just say this: You know that your campaign is not going well when you open a press conference by saying, 'I told you there would be more lewd photos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner is saying he hopes people will give him a second chance, and I'm all in favor of that; but by my counting, I believe this will be his third chance. Anthony Weiner says some of the accusations are true and some of the accusations are not true. And you know what that means. That means, of course, that they're all true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we begin with an event as shocking as it was depressingly predictable. You may remember that last week we covered former Congressman Anthony Weiner and the fact that he wasn't just running for mayor of New York City, but leading in the polls. ? He did it again? Why did he even need to do that? Who did he think had possibly not seen his photo from last time? Did he think that a woman might have been in a coma during the first go-round? So, two years ago this photo caused a scandal that cost him his political career. ? Now, America is collectively experiencing deja-ewwwwww.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He calls himself Carlos Danger. Anthony Weiner's alter ego is a Bolivian action hero slash porn star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Oliver:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hold on. Let me get this straight. You're spinning this by saying, 'See, I was right all along. I made a promise that there was more sleaze out there and I'm man of my word. Weiner, 2013.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, New York, New York, the city that never sleeps, just got one more thing to keep it up at night, because yesterday, the thinkable happened. ? These are serious times. This city has serious problems. And I do not want Anthony Weiner as my mayor. I want Carlos Danger. Carlos Danger. A man of whatever the opposite of mystery is. Just think about it, folks. A year after being hounded from office in national, nay, global disgrace for recreational crotch photography, does he stop? No, he presses on. That's the kind of single-minded dedication you need as mayor of New York City, because as Mayor, Carlos Danger will face impossible challenges every day. ? He's not scared of anything, because Carlos Danger's middle name is also Danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how two years ago when [then-New York Rep. Anthony] Weiner resigned, he said more embarrassing pictures may come out in the future. Do you know how he knew that? 'Cause he went home after that and sent them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After admitting to sending pictures of himself to a woman a year after he quit Congress to supposedly seek treatment, he now says it's all in the rear-view mirror. Well, that's something you don't want to see, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Weiner admitted to still sending out photos of his privates, Eliot Spitzer pointed out on Wednesday that he has not been with a prostitute since 2008. Eliot Spitzer now claiming the moral high ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Donald Trump heard that Anthony Weiner was using the name Carlos Danger, Donald Trump demanded to see Carlos Danger's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know you're struggling if you have to open your press conference with 'Well, I told you there was going to be more of this stuff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm conflicted about Anthony Weiner. On one hand, after the pain he caused his family, I think he should drop out of the race. On the other hand, his staying makes my job even easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man behind the NSA leaking scandal, Edward Snowden, still living at the Moscow airport. He's been there since June 23rd. He's been in that airport longer than 'The Lone Ranger' was in movie theaters, you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech about the economy, President Obama said we've all been distracted by phony scandals. And it's time we started getting distracted by the phony recovery. Yeah, that's what I say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are comparing Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer. I mean, they're both running for offices in New York, but you really can't compare them. I mean, Anthony Weiner sent people pictures of his genitals. Eliot Spitzer created jobs, high-paying jobs. Okay, they're just for an hour at a time, but they were high-paying jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York papers and many constituents are now calling for Anthony Weiner to pull out of the race. On the bright side, if he can't be mayor of New York, he's certainly qualified to be mayor of San Diego.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are now a total of seven women accusing San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment. But you know, it's nice to be a politician getting into a sex scandal the old-fashioned way: in person, by groping and touching. Not, you know, not these impersonal text messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Weiner's &quot;campaign manager in the race for mayor just quit, because of Weiner's newest scandal. It's tough finding a replacement. Every time he emails someone, they're like 'I'm not opening that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new sexting scandal was too much, so his campaign manager called it quits. And Weiner was like, 'What kind of candidate quits because of something like that?' And then voters said, 'Ideally, you. You should quit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton made a trip back to DC today, and actually went back to the White House to have lunch with President Obama, and, you know, measure the drapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard Great Britain is planning to add a picture of Jane Austen to their currency. Americans are like, 'I wonder when a woman will be on our currency?' Then Hillary was like, 'Soon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you're ready, because you have to lock your lungs and batten down your colon, because Obamacare is coming. The individual mandate takes effect on New Year's Day, which means when the Times Square ball drops, it will immediately be checked for lumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare is being implemented despite the best efforts of House Republicans, who have voted to symbolically repeal it 39 times. I don't know why it's not working. Maybe they need to load more emptiness into their gestures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the key to implementing Obamacare is the so-called individual mandate, because to keep premium costs down, officials say they must register 2.7 million healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35 in order to counteract the costs of ensuring seniors and people with health problems. Don't fall for it, young people. You don't need insurance. You're going to be young and healthy forever. ? Now fortunately, the godfather of the Tea Party movement, FreedomWorks, recently announced a 'Burn Your Obamacare Card' campaign. That's right, young ones. Protest this government overreach by lighting your insurance card on fire. But be careful, because if you burn yourself, you don't have health insurance. There's only one small problem with this burn-your-Obamacare-card plan. There are no such things as Obamacare cards. But FreedomWorks isn't letting a little thing like not existing get in its way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'New York Post,' the Clintons are really angry about being compared to the Weiners, and rightly so. You know, Bill Clinton took his sexual conduct seriously. Anthony Weiner, he just phones it in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, our lawmakers' popularity keeps sinking faster than a research facility at the North Pole. In the latest phone survey about Congress, it ranked below having your dinner interrupted by a phone survey about Congress. But these numbers have nothing to do with the job that the lawmakers are doing, because they are not doing it. Halfway through 2013, just 15 bills passed by Congress had become law. They almost passed a 16th bill, but Obama refused to sign HR-2904, the 'This Is Not Another Repeal of Obamacare, We Swear But Don't Look Inside It, Just Sign It' Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In politics, plus-size New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul are in a bit of battle right now. For those who don't know, Rand Paul is RuPaul's straight-edge, conservative brother, something like that. Apparently, Governor Christie criticized Rand Paul for pork-barrel spending, so Rand fired back. He said this is the 'king of bacon' talking about bacon. The king of bacon, is that supposed to be an insult? I would kneel before the king of bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it is notable, because Governor Christie is a very large man, and he called him the 'king of bacon.' He had that surgery, though. So far, he's lost about 50 pounds. I hope he gets down to 160 pounds. I would love to see Governor Christie holding an enormous pair of pants above his head like Jared from Subway. Wouldn't that be inspiring?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I tell you, whatever is going on in New Jersey is peanuts compared to what is going on with Anthony Weiner in New York. Today's news was, one of his former interns shared a great story with 'The New York Daily News'. She claims at one point, this is not sexual, he called all 20 interns into his office. He told them, 'Tell me your names, and I'll be able to go around the room and remember all of your names.' And then he started to go around the room and couldn't remember any of their names. He knew their screen names. But he did not know their?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are saying maybe Anthony Weiner should get out of the race. Maybe he should go run for mayor of Orange County.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I, for one, always try to keep a level head, but even I am enraged by this Bradley Manning trial. First of all, that he had a trial. Those prisoners in Gitmo must be dying to know how he wrangled that sweet deal. You may remember Bradley Manning as the Wiki-leaker who released the infamous collateral murder video, or perhaps for being the least athletic Manning brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, since his arrest three years ago, Manning has been held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, forced to sleep naked without pillows and sheets on his bed. But I say he deserves it. For Pete's sake, the guy revealed that the United States tortures, partly through his document leak, but mostly by how we tortured him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manning was found not guilty of the most serious charge: Aiding the enemy. And even more shocking, he was also found not guilty of shooting Trayvon Martin. Evidently, no one is guilty of that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Obama gave a major speech about the economy at an Amazon distribution center. I think he chose Amazon because they're going to start equipping congressmen with a 'buy now' button.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to a photo of President Obama's lunch with Hillary Clinton) &quot;I don't need news from the cable crowd, because I can analyze the entire 2016 campaign strategy through this lunch. First of all, Hillary's campaign, it is on to the on. And obviously, they ate outdoors to woo the environmentalists. Had the jambalaya to court Gulf Coast-Democrats. President's rolled-up sleeves say, 'I support the right to bare arms.' But the lack of beverages says that under Hillary, there will be no waterboarding, tap or sparkling. And the grilled chicken? It was on sale at Safeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's talk a little bit about Governor Chris Christie over in New Jersey. ... I love that guy. But now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is criticizing Christie for the pork-barrel spending in his state. He even called Governor Christie the 'king of bacon.' Christie would have been offended, but in fairness, that is what it says on his apron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So actually, here's what Rand Paul said. He said, 'In terms of pork-barrel spending, Christie is the king of bacon.' Low blow. Well, in response, Christie fired back. He said 'That kind of name calling is beneath the office you hold, sir. But just to clarify, would I be the king of real juicy pork bacon or that gross generic turkey bacon?' To which Paul replied, 'What? I don't know, man. Bacon, bacon. Look, your fiscal values are not in line with the Republican Party.' To which Christie said, 'Are you kidding, I'm as Republican as they come. But hey, back to that king of bacon thing. Do you think I wear a crown of bacon or sit on a throne of bacon? Or would I just be all like eating bacon all the time?' To which Paul said, 'Dude, it was just a metaphor. Let it go. My point is your state's spending is out of control.' To which Christie says, 'I'll tell you what's out of control - how much you got me thinking about bacon. You do whatever you want with the Republican Party. I'm about to start a bacon party in my tum-tum.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more people calling for Anthony Weiner to step aside. But, in a new ad campaign, Weiner says, 'Quit isn't the way we roll in New York City.' Well, it's better than his old slogan: 'When in doubt, whip it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

But did you know that our tax system is somehow not universally beloved? ? While we haven't reformed the tax code since 1986, we've certainly added lots of new provisions and loopholes to it. It's like, imagine you have the same refrigerator for the last 27 years. You haven't cleaned it in all of that time. But you keep putting food in there.

And the hiring process should be easy, since there's already plenty of guys on the subway ready to give pat-downs. ? But folks, this massive expansion comes after reports that TSA misconduct increased 26% over the last three years. Well, that makes sense, because you have to spread misconduct over a broader sample size. Just like if you ever cheat on your girlfriend, you have to get a bunch more girlfriends so you're more faithful per capita. This expansion of the TSA beyond airports is known as VIPR. There's no 'e' in that word, because it was detained for appearing twice in the word 'Yemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

I guess the attorney general got suspicious it wasn't a real college when Donald took the senior class on a field trip to try and find President Obama's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain got caught in an embarrassing moment yesterday. A photographer from the Washington Post caught him playing poker on his phone during the first public hearing on the potential US military action in Syria. Caught playing poker on his phone.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While some believe it's inappropriate to be playing a video game while the committee is deciding whether or not to kill people and potentially start a war, I say the man is John McCain. The man is 114 years old. We should be impressed he's even wearing pants, never mind he's using a cellphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like we're getting ready to teach Syria a lesson, and President Obama is now saying that he never used the term 'red line.' Remember when he was talking about if we find out that they used chemical weapons in Syria that that would be crossing a red line, and if they cross that red line, by God, we had to go in there and get them? ... Well, now the President is saying he never used the term 'red line.' He's saying that the world used the term 'red line.' So it's taken him five years, but finally the guy has learned how to bull(bleep).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain. ... They're having a big Senate discussion on whether or not we're going to teach Syria a lesson and?well, during the talk, the discussion, he's playing online poker on his computer. Online poker on his computer during a Senate session on whether we're going to Syria or not. I was stunned! You're telling me John McCain knows how to use a computer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been warning you for years that Barack Obama is a weak leader, and he has proven me right once again. ... The man could not lead us on healthcare reform. He could not lead us on the budget talks. And now, he can not lead us into war, specifically, with Syria, where dictator and high school freshman trying to grow a mustache Bashar al-Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people. Now, as the world's policeman, America has a moral imperative to blow some (bleep) up. But thanks to Obama's limp leadership, that idea is going over like a turd falafel. Only 29% of Americans want us to attack Syria. Now, on the plus side, that means 29% of Americans know there is a place called Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss George W. Bush. ... That man knew how to sell a war. Obama has hard evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and he can't even get England to go along with it. Meanwhile, President Bush got an international coalition with nothing more than Colin Powell's reputation and half a test tube of Crystal Light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, President Obama, you could learn a thing or two about salesmanship from this good man. Stop asking our permission and start telling us our peril, like this: 'My fellow Americans, Bashar al-Assad has used poison gas on his own people. If we do not respond, sources say next he will hit Epcot, thereby taking out Paris, London, and China, and it flows over to Disney - that's all of our robotic presidents. Furthermore, we have satellite photos of him punching your mother and sodomizing a baseball. And he has purchased uranium from Hitler's ghost. It is our moral obligation to stop this madman, and if Britain won't help us, I say (bleep) 'em. From now on, English muffins will be called liberty toast, because America, this land is my land and your land, and America does not back down on the face of tyranny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain was playing poker during a hearing. The worst part is that he didn't even know he was playing poker. He was just trying to text his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All week, President Obama has been saying he'll seek congressional approval for the strike, but he insists he doesn't really need it. And when asked by the media if he was sending mixed messages, the President said yes and no. Well, despite what the critics say, President Obama says the lack of response to Syria so far does not threaten his credibility. And you know something, he's right. The economy, Benghazi, the spying scandal - that threatens his credibility. But this other stuff, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is criticizing McCain for playing poker on his iPhone. But you know something? Compared to what these other politicians are doing on their iPhones, that's not so bad, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anthony Weiner. This guy just doesn't give up. He got in a big confrontation with a voter in New York City today. Yeah, Weiner said to this guy, 'You have no right to judge me.' Really? I don't think Anthony Weiner understands how voting works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain is under fire for being caught playing poker on his smart phone during a Senate hearing on Syria. ... Even worse, it was strip poker. That was the worst part. We saw much more of him than we want to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Siskiyou County is more rural than other parts of California. They feel like their needs and interests are not being represented properly, so they want to form their own state.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But all eyes are on Obama, because of Syria. He wants to use military strikes. Even his allies don't agree with him. Britain wants to use economic embargoes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama canceled a fundraising trip to California next week because of the Syrian situation. That's when you know it's serious, okay, when President Obama cancels a fundraiser. Oh, my God. We're in code red!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Tuesday, President Obama's planning to address the nation. Instead of calling for his plan to attack Syria a war, he's calling it a 'limited military intervention,' which sounds better than 'potential endless quagmire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State John Kerry said that Arab countries have offered to pay the entire cost of unseating Syria's president. They will pay for the whole thing. This is how global politics work. We invade Syria to get money from Saudi Arabia that they got from us for putting their oil in our Japanese cars so we could pay back China all the money we owe them. You follow me? You follow? You see how that works?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry also said during the Senate hearings that we are not the world's policemen. Really? How come we eat most of the world's doughnuts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain was caught playing poker on his iPhone during hearings about Syria last week. You got to admit--wasn't it nice to see a senator at least gambling with his own money for a change?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new report released yesterday showed that illegal drug use among the elderly is surging. Everything from marijuana to meth. Can you imagine? And you can tell the ones that are on meth. They're the ones playing 30 bingo cards at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for old people. Old people are in the news today because apparently old people are on drugs. And not sad street drugs. Marijuana. According to a new study, people over 60 are the fastest growing group of pot smokers. Experts say old people have been spotted syncing up 'Dark Side of the Moon' with 'Matlock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States has issued a travel warning not to travel to Syria, unless, of course, you're a cruise missile. Then, I guess it's okay.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going to address the nation on Syria tomorrow night. Which means here on NBC, 'America's Got Talent' will be delayed by 'America's Got Problems.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he will make the best case he can about a military strike against Syria. And if Congress says no, then he will ask Syria for permission to bomb Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his weekly radio address, President Obama said US military involvement in Syria would have a definite time limit. Really? A definite time limit? Are you buying that? ... We still have troops in Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said any attack on Syria will be 'unbelievably small.' Well, that should put the fear of God into them. Huh? 'Listen to me, we get approval, we will attack you so tiny, you won't even know what happened.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sixty percent of Americans polled said that they don't want a war in Syria. So, you know what that means? We're going to be at war in Syria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with the 'Today' show this morning, Anthony Weiner, he said he's convinced that he'll be the next mayor of New York City, even though only 7% of voters support him. Even Kathie Lee [Gifford] and Hoda [Kotb] were like, 'That guy must be drunk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Iowa are facing criticism over a new law that lets blind people own guns. So far, it's actually received support from two major groups, the NRA and deer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You needlessly invade one country based on false evidence, suddenly you're bad at war. We've had a very solid war career, very solid, between 40 to 60% justified. But all anybody wants to talk about is the most recent one of the wrong ones. It's like we're the Bill Buckner of superpowers now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President spoke earlier tonight about Syria. You know, the polls show many Americans are ill-informed about Syria. In fact, nine-out-of-ten people surveyed thought Syria is the female voice in their iPhones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has given Syria one week to hand over its chemical weapons. And if they don't, he'll give them another week. So that's kind of where we are right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's foreign policy taking a beating, especially abroad. They're not as excited about him as they used to be. In fact, people in Kenya are saying, 'We're positive he wasn't born here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last month, 312,000 Americans stopped looking for work, causing the unemployment rate to fall to 7.3%. Today, President Obama called it a step in the right direction and encouraged more Americans to stop looking for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you aware of the fact it is Election Day here in New York City? ... Very important election.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Great news - China just bought San Diego</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where's Forest Whitaker with my coffee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. We do not yet know who created these super-intelligent squirrels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. I've deployed three warships: The Roker, The Bieber and the Weiner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I won't sugarcoat things; we're screwed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By now you've seen and evaluated my underpants photo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dead silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Syria agreed to a tentative plan to hand over all its chemical weapons to Russia. ... Vladimir Putin said, 'And those weapons better not be gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a primary for the mayor of New York city. ... But get this - the city had to use old lever voting machines from the '60s, because the electronic machines were too hard to program. ? That's right. New York City used old lever-voting machines from the 1960s, which got weird when the officials checked the results and said the winner is Richard Nixon. The newer machines were not properly programmed, or as Florida put it, 'Never stops us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama had two separate lunches with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, to press them on the need for action in Syria. Two lunches, or as Chris Christie put it, 'Maybe I do want to be President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upshot is that America will not attack Syria for gassing its citizens if they give up their chemicals weapons. It is like if you decapitate a co-worker, so they are taking away your ax. But you get to keep your job and your hatchet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York, last night, former Congressman Anthony Weiner was the first candidate to concede in his bid to become the Democratic candidate for mayor. Not sure who won the election - all I know is Anthony Weiner lost. He got less than five percent of the vote and came in fifth. That is a shame. There's got to be something else he can run for. I have 3,000 more Weiner jokes. Maybe I can get him on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday we had an election here in New York City. Guess what? Anthony Weiner is not going to be mayor of New York City. You think you're disappointed, for God's sake. ... It was interesting - he gave his concession speech, then he gave everyone the finger. Honest to God. You've got to be careful, because that's the kind of thing people will remember.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Yorkers are going to miss Anthony Weiner. ... Because it's always nice having someone around who makes you feel morally superior, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Anthony Weiner [was asked], 'What are you going to do now?' He said, 'I'm going to take some time off, couple of weeks, probably spend a couple weeks, maybe a month, spend some time with my cell phone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are following the news, you know that this is an exciting time in New York City politics. Just yesterday, voters turned out to nominate replacements for outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Someone's got to fill this man's shoes, which is why I cast my vote for an American girl doll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if you remember, last week on this very show, I endorsed Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota, because after two kittens stranded on the tracks forced the subway line to stop service for several hours, Lhota was the only candidate with the courage to come out as pro-crushing kittens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lhota now moves on to the general election, where he's likely facing Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio, a man so liberal, he won the gay vote against a lesbian. Folks, de Blasio?must be stopped. This mad man wants to raise taxes on those making more than half a million dollars a year, costing guys like me about $973. $973? I'll have to stop buying my yearly pair of Gucci python loafers. How will I know it's spring? Even worse, de Blasio tricked voters by running this heartwarming ad featuring his biracial family, a cynical strategy that Bloomberg rightly called 'racist.' Yes, what is more racist than falling in love with a black woman and fathering a child just so you can claim you're against stop and frisk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there's an even bigger biracial problem in this country - Barack Obama. Last night, our so-called Commander in Chief attacked our Tuesday night lineup to talk about Syria. We had to miss 'America's Got Talent,' just to watch 'America's Got Serious Reservations About This.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say if Obama really wanted to sell us Syria, he should have taken a page from the people selling us Siri, because pushing the iPhone and a war are a lot alike. You just say that the new one is smaller, faster, and cheaper, and people will buy it, even though they've already got one and they're still paying off the previous model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, there it is. Crisis averted. Now, Congress suspends its vote on a military strike, the UN secures Assad's chemicals stockpiles, and the Syrian people can go back to being killed with conventional weapons. Everybody wins. Of course, that's just my analysis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to de Blasio's family) &quot;There is his wife, Shirley McCray, which, until she met her husband, was a devout lesbian, which we know from her 1979 article. This is why de Blasio can win. The Democrats love him because he is an old-fashioned conservative. And this is why Republicans love him - because he can turn gay people straight. What's better than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see this? Anthony Weiner's former sexting partner Sydney Leathers - she actually showed up at his official primary party, which was also attended by Weiner's wife. Weiner was like, 'What is she doing here? She's going to ruin my chances with Sydney Leathers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama spoke to the nation about Syria. And hopefully, Americans who are confused about the President's plan feel better now knowing that he's confused, too. Well, it was confusing, wasn't it? First, President Obama laid out his reasoning for a strike against Syria. And then he gave the rebuttal. Here's the really weird part. After all that, he introduced Apple's new iPhone 5s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the speech last night, President Obama asked for support from his friends on the left and his friends on the right. Apparently, he thinks he has a lot more friends than he really does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, he called on Congress to delay voting on any military action in Syria. He's asking for the time being, Congress do nothing. Well, that shouldn't be too hard for them, huh? That's the one thing they're good at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Pentagon, Syria has 1,000 metric tons of deadly chemicals. That is enough to make over 10 million Twinkies, do you realize?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has insisted that any military strike on Syria will be unbelievably small. Not as small as the support for a strike on Syria. ... No, Kerry claims a military strike will send a message to Iran. And today, Syria said, 'If you want to send a message to Iran, bomb Iran. Bomb that guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weiner's sexting partner, Sydney Leathers, remember the woman he was sexting? She crashed his concession speech. She was there last night. Here's the embarrassing part - she got more votes for mayor than he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times today published an unusual op-ed piece. It was unusual, because it was written by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is taking his case on Syria directly to the American people. I like that he thinks we read the New York Times op-ed section. Unless he had it published in the crossword puzzle section, 99% of us will never even see it. But in the article, he warns against what he calls American exceptionalism. On Tuesday, you know, President Obama called Americans exceptional. He said we're different from other countries. But Putin disagrees with that. He wrote, 'It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.' Sound like a fun dad, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin said that when Americans claim to be exceptional it offends other countries around the world. This from the man who regularly arrests his political opponents and persecutes people based on sexual orientation and who put a girl group in a labor camp for singing songs he didn't like. So it's not that we think we're better than everyone else, we just think we're better than you, specifically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know this or not, but it's quite a week for me, because Eliot Spitzer lost his race for comptroller. Anthony Weiner lost his race for New York City mayor. ? So that means I am back to being New York City's biggest embarrassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a great day for American politicians. They are all a bit embarrassed. I'm like, what? What could they possibly be embarrassed about? Well, they are embarrassed because Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote a scolding op-ed piece in the New York Times. I think he is adorable. He thinks people still read the New York Times. He should have tweeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you haven't seen the New York Times piece, Putin said America should stay out of Syria. And then he said Khloe should dump Lamar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are outraged that Vladimir Putin wrote for one of our newspapers. But Putin is no stranger to American journalism. A couple of years ago, he wrote a letter to Penthouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as promised let's talk about that Putin guy. ? How dare the New York Times print the propaganda of a homicidal KGB klepto. ... I assume he's filling in for Maureen Dowd this week while she's on vacation with polonium poisoning. Because news flash, New York Times: He murders journalists. We don't do that in America. We just let you starve to death in your dying industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thinking are you exceptional is not extremely dangerous. It's exceptionally dangerous. Folks, I was on the fence before this, but now it's clear we've got to bomb Syria. I mean, massive air strikes. And just to stick it to Putin, I say we use lesbian pilots flying the Enola Gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to Obama's speech on Syria) &quot;The President on Tuesday night interrupted the prime time schedules of every major television network to walk down 'I Killed bin Laden Lane' and make the case for American intervention in Syria. Because going ahead and making the speech even after the Russians made that offer, and the Syrians accepted it, was the best thing to do. Not because they had put a deposit down on that time before momentum swung to a more peaceful resolution and apparently they can't get their money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian President Vladimir Putin actually wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times, where he said it's dangerous for Americans to see themselves as exceptional. Then he said...'Except for that Timberlake, that guy is freaking amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Vladimir Putin, you know, the Russian president. ... He wrote an op-ed piece for the New York Times.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government officials in Syria have finally admitted, yes, they do have weapons of mass destruction. Today, former President George Bush said, 'That's where they were! I was so close! I was so - I knew they were around there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syrian President Assad says he is turning over his chemical weapons, because Russia asked him to, not because of the US threatening to bomb him. Oh, yeah, yeah. And Osama bin Laden? He's at the bottom of the ocean right now, because he enjoys scuba diving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it was also revealed today that the CIA has begun delivering weapons to the rebels in Syria. Now, before you get outraged, the rebels have promised not to use those weapons against us until after they topple Assad. So, phew. So, we got a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, even if we do get rid of Assad, we still have much bigger problems. What the hell do we do with Anthony Weiner? You know how much free time he's going to have now? Well, at his concession speech, former New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner said he had the best message, but he was an imperfect messenger. Oh, shut up. It wasn't that he was an imperfect messenger. It was that people were afraid to open his messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may not remember, but I do. Five years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy triggering the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bet you all had forgotten. But I even got you a cake. ... It's actually a bunch of cake - some fresh, some spoiled, bundled into a larger cake derivative, all right. Now, fair warning: there might be some poop in there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, it feels like only yesterday that banks were taking unethical risks with everyone's money, because they were also doing it yesterday. But America is defined by its resilience. No matter what mistakes we make, we pick ourselves up, we dust ourselves off, and come together with the courage to deny that we ever made a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, America's economy is back. The Dow is reaching record highs. The housing market is rebounding. The auto industry exists. And even young people are finding good jobs in construction. And folks, this is good for everyone. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats. Also, buy a boat or you'll drown. Because 95% of income gains since the recovery have gone to the top 1%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't fret, not-rich people. You will get your share, because our economy is like a pyramid. We rich are at the peak, and soon the money will start trickling down to you people, so be patient. And if you are good, you can be buried with me in my pyramid. So, if you are a middle-class American wondering where all the money in this recovery went, don't worry, it's in good hands. Living with me now. By the way, the money says, 'Hi!' It wants you to know that it's happy now, and it wants you to be happy too. But you have to move on because it's not coming back. In fact, it's gone to a farm upstate - in that I used it to buy a large farm upstate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And 399 of them were bankers that got us into the recession five years ago. What are the odds of that? ... You know...this week marks the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which of course sparked the recession. Think about how bad things were back then. We had unemployment...over 7%. The debt was out of control. There were wars breaking out all over the globe. Thank God that's all behind us now, huh? Whoo.

I'm afraid all that money is my cross to bear. It's a cross made of solid gold. Very nice, actually.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an opinion piece that was published in the New York Times. It was a letter directed at the American people, and in response, Sen. John McCain just wrote his own op-ed that was published on a Russian news website. The piece was titled 'Russians Deserve Better Than Putin,' and he really called Putin out. He exposed him for the thug that he is. He did. You have to give him credit for it. In fact, he dissed the Russian president so hard, there's speculation he may have collaborated with Kendrick Lamar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, there was some confusion when it came to publishing the letter. McCain intended it to be published in 'Pravda,' which is one of Russia's oldest and respected newspapers. But instead, it was published on the website Pravda.ru, which has no affiliation with the newspaper at all, and it appears that the letter went through some kind of government filter before it was posted, which, I guess, isn't surprising for a country that still doesn't have freedom of the press. But what was surprising was the tone of the translation. It almost seemed friendly, which was not how it was intended. This is how it was translated, 'Vladimir Putin is very sexy man and very strong like bear or bull. If I were lady, I would sex him. I am not lady. Therefore, I envious his muscles and strong eyes, but not in gay way. Putin is hero!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals just made an interesting decision about Facebook. They said that liking something on Facebook is considered free speech and is, therefore, protected under the First Amendment. The case went to court because a former deputy sheriff in Virginia claimed he was fired for liking the Facebook page of the candidate running against his boss for sheriff. Which, the real takeaway is, do not Facebook friend your boss under any circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Republicans and Democrats can't get together, there's a strong possibility of a Federal government shutdown. You know what the legal definition of that is?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama met with the President of Nigeria, who advised President Obama to eliminate America's debt by sending out fraudulent emails. Just keep sending out fraudulent emails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now making a case for raising the debt limit. He said that raising the debt limit does not increase debt. And, you know, I got to defer to the President on this one, because when it comes to increasing the debt, Obama knows what he's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Texas Senator Ted Cruz began a filibuster on the Senate floor. He's trying to stop Obamacare and he vowed to keep speaking until he is no longer able to stand. And the good news - if he collapses from exhaustion, he'll be covered under Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the voice of reason, Sarah Palin, has entered the fray. She's now giving her support to Ted Cruz's filibuster. I think she's a little confused. She said she's been a big fan of Ted Cruz ever since she saw 'Top Gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a big antelope hunt this past weekend, former Vice President Dick Cheney's gun apparently malfunctioned. Gun didn't fire, couldn't get off a shot. Didn't stop Cheney - he actually grabbed the antelope and then water-boarded him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so exciting when they open the UN. They have a special theme this year - 'Enchantment Under the Sea.' Very nice. ? We have world leaders from all over the world - dictators, presidents, kings, queens, that kind of thing, for the UN opening up. And when they come here, they have what they call diplomatic immunity. They can do whatever they want. They can break any kind of laws. I saw a dictator today walking up Broadway carrying a 16-ounce soda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Home Depot just announced that that it will cut health insurance for its part-time workers, because of Obamacare. Home Depot's CEO said he had a hard time breaking the news to employees. You know, because it took him three hours to find one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - that's my man. He's a great guy. Well, anyways, he's running a new Spanish-language commercial for his re-election campaign. Which seems like a stretch, because, like, the only Spanish phrase he knows is 'Yo quiero Taco Bell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian president Vladimir Putin just revealed he may run for a fourth term in 2018. Yep. In fact, he already came up with a few campaign posters. Let's take a look at this first one. It says, 'I will put middle class families first (on the bus to Siberia).' You've got to read the parentheses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about Dick Cheney over the weekend? ? He entered a shooting contest. And it turns out his gun malfunctioned and didn't fire. It wasn't good. In fact, he ended up having to just throw some ammo in his friend's face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, next Tuesday, October 1st?is the day that Obama's healthcare is open for sign up. I like my healthcare like I like my women, universal and with a waiting list for nonessential procedures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess if you really, sincerely believe this (Obamacare) is a terrible program that Americans will hate, I have to respect your principled stand, Ted Cruz. ? You are protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that, once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without. You only win if the program fails. Obamacare is your 'Springtime for Hitler.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you what happens midnight, October 1: The United States government...shuts down. At midnight, yeah. And right now in Times Square, they're getting ready to drop the ball. People say they're closing down the government, they get scared. I'll give you an example: Diana Nyad swam back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal government will shut down and only essential employees will remain. The Presidential chief of staff will remain when the government shuts down. Economic advisers will stay in place when the government shuts down. And White House butler Forrest Whitaker. Those are the three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that senator from Texas, Ted Cruz? ? He gets ahold of the microphone, the floor of the Senate, and he starts talking, and people are thinking, 'Oh, well, it's Ted, let him go for a while.' Twenty one hours...ladies and gentlemen. He's yakking for 21 hours. I'm telling you, that government shutdown certainly looks pretty good now, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-one hours. I don't think I've talked for 21 hours in my entire life. And at one point he takes out?'Green Eggs and Ham.' You know the kiddie book? He's reading 'Green Eggs and Ham,' and the whole thing was Obamacare. And the message he was sending there, I think, is Obamacare will only cover visits to Dr. Seuss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I don't know if you've been watching the news, but what an historic night, destined to be down in the annals of importance. After an equally historic yester-last night, when one devoted crusader - or should I say one Devo-Ted-Cruz-ator - talked about the need to defund Obamacare for 21 hours and 19 minutes and did what many thought was impossible - make the Senate even less productive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This courageous man is fighting to defund Obamacare by filibustering a bill that defunds Obamacare. And what makes it truly courageous, the bill was his idea. And it's not really a filibuster. Cruz knew in advance he'd have to yield the floor by noon today. I believe the room was booked for Danny Goldstein's bar mitzvah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying Obamacare is perfect. It's not. It was designed by Congress. Nothing designed by Congress is perfect. You ask them to design a puppy, you'd get something with no face, two [bleep] and a semiautomatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his protest, Cruz actually read from the book 'Green Eggs and Ham' by Dr. Seuss. Democrats were like, 'When will this end?' While Chris Christie was like, 'When do we get those eggs and ham?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, despite all of the controversy, President Obama says he's still moving forward with the healthcare law. In fact, the White House announced that residents of Florida will have 102 different insurance options when Obamacare rolls out. ... Because if there's one thing we know people in Florida love, it is a confusing number of options. That's going to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Republicans and Democrats are trying to agree on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. You know, if the government does shutdown, one of the first services that will stop will be processing of passports and visas. You know what that means? Some foreigners may try to enter this country illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, 'Breaking Bad' has its final episode on Sunday. As you know?it's the story of this chemistry teacher. He teaches chemistry in high school. And he has cancer and starts making meth to help cover his medical bills and provide for his family. Or as Republicans call that, a legitimate alternative to Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his effort to try and stop Obamacare, Texas Senator Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours and 19 minutes nonstop. Nonstop. Impressive, but still eight hours short of the record held when somebody asked Joe Biden, 'Hey, what's new?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Twenty-one hours of listening to Ted Cruz. How awful is that? Still not as bad as 21 hours of a Carnival cruise, but still bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know crazy Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He spoke for 21 hours on the floor of the Senate. Just talking and talking and talking until he could barely stand. And coincidentally, after 21 hours nobody could barely stand him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House John Boehner says Americans don't want healthcare. ...Well, there you go. Conclusive evidence, too much time in the tanning bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was in the news this week because he gave this interview and he said that his daughter Chelsea would actually be a better president than Hillary. You can tell Hillary's mad. Because tonight she kicked him off the couch and made him sleep in their bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well in a letter to John Boehner, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the government will run out of money in just three weeks. You know, I'm no financial whiz, but we're $16 trillion in debt. Doesn't that mean we already ran out of money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The post office is now asking for a three-cent increase to 49 cents for first-class mail. They say it's needed because fewer and fewer people are using the post office and they're losing money. See, that's government thinking. Only the government would think, 'Hey, I know how to attract more customers. Let's raise the price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama now making his case for raising the debt limit. He said raising the debt limit does not increase debt. You know, like raising the speed limit does not increase speed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Sen. Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours straight on the Senate floor against Obamacare. And believe me, it got pretty boring. In fact, politicians were comparing it to a 15-minute speech by John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, since we tape earlier, we don't know if there was any kind of last-minute deal before the government shutdown. But, both sides are blaming each other. The Republicans are pointing their fingers at Democrats. Democrats are pointing their fingers at the Republicans. And Americans are pointing the middle finger at both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole thing comes down to who will blink first. Well, we know it won't be Nancy Pelosi. We know that for sure. Because she hasn't blinked since the last shutdown 17 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, since 1976, there have been 17 government shutdowns. The longest was during the four years that Jimmy Carter was President. That was the longest one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what else is going on. Sen. Ted Cruz's 21-hour talk-a-thon has skyrocketed him into the presidential race. As far as conservatives go, he leads the field. Well, there were questions if he could run, because he was born in Canada. See, that sums up the American dream right there. When a Latino born in Canada can come to America and, by attacking the money we borrowed from China, can become a front-runner of a party who believes the President was born in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has broken his silence. Mitt Romney said it's time to stop Obamacare, because it's a bad law that will hurt the country. Well, he should know. He invented it. So, there you have it right there. No, that's what Romney said. He said we must stop Obamacare, now. And then, the kid behind the counter at McDonald's said, 'Do you want the large drink or not?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's shutting down. Is it tomorrow night? About 24 hours from now they're shutting down. Do you care the government's shutting down? I thought they were shut down. And Americans don't care. ? The last time Americans cared about anything was when they shut down the Twinkie factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some national parks will be shut down, some museums, some national monuments will be shut down. For example, down in Washington, they're going to close the Smithsonian. So, if you have tickets, forget it. You're not getting in. They're going to close the Smithsonian. They're going to close the Air and Space Museum. You're not getting into there. They're closing the Hillary Clinton Pants Suit Museum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those just joining the story in progress, our government is going to shut down in 57 of your earth minutes. Because the House Republicans are refusing to fund the government, unless the rest of Congress delays implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare - also known as the 'End of America as We Know It For Reasons No One is Able to Clearly Explain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best part about the finale of 'Breaking Gov' is that the bad guys are all getting eliminated - the National Park Service, the Center for Disease Control, NASA, which is slated to furlough 97% of its employees immediately. And the government hadn't even shut down yet, but the reviews are already in. Michele Bachmann raves: 'We're very excited. It's exactly what we wanted and we got it.' And California Rep. Devon Nunez says conservative Republicans are 'all giddy about it.' Of course they're giddy. They will still get paid in the event of a shutdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watched the news at all today, you know that we are on the verge of a government shutdown. It is bad, because we need to keep the government working so they can continue to not do things on our behalf. What's happening is a group of very motivated House Republicans...are refusing to let a budget pass unless provisions are included to defund Obamacare. ? President Obama gave a speech suggesting this is a hostage situation, but the Republicans said they are not holding America hostage and if he would bother to read their ransom note that would be perfectly clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government shutdown has happened before. The last one was in 1996, but the debate on this one is particularly heated, because people have such strong opinions about Obamacare. The polls show that Americans don't like Obamacare, but they like what's in it. It's like the opposite of a McNugget.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we got the government shutdown, but Obamacare has started. You know what that means? You can now complain to your doctor about the government making you sick. How many are worried about the government shutdown? How many more are worried about it starting back up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. I am glad the government has shut down. Think about it. For the first time in years, it's safe to talk on the phone and send emails without anybody listening in. This is fantastic! You can talk to whoever you want!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ironically, during the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of nonessential employees, government employees, will be laid off because of - well, because of our non-intelligent employees in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do have a lot of nonessential employees. Think about this. Like the Treasury Secretary. Why is he there? We don't have any money in the Treasury. He's got nothing to do. The room is empty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States government, the most powerful country, shut down, not in business. Put the out-of-business sign in the White House, nothing happening here. We are like a Carnival Cruise on land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government just shut down. After Congress failed to reach an agreement on the new spending bill, the Federal government has officially shut down, so roads won't get fixed, public employees won't be able to help you, and getting a Federal loan for a house will be very difficult. But there will also be a lot of differences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of Congress were drinking last night while debating the government shutdown. Which explains that one part where they said, 'The floor recognizes the representative from Margaritaville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, folks, thank you for being here. Thank you for braving the marauding gangs and packs of wild dogs that now rule the night in America! Because as of midnight last night, the government of the United States officially closed for business. Finally, a chance to use our famous nation-building skills right at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, folks, the Federal government may be shuttered, but the Colbert Nation is alive and well. And I am proud and prepared to fill the power vacuum as your Lord of the Afterscape! Bow before me! Bring me tributes of sheep and unsoiled daughters! I also accept Visa! I will seize all government functions. Who needs the FDA? Just send me your drugs. I'll test them for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest, I didn't notice the government was shut down today. But the 800,000 government employees who had their hours cut or jobs taken away definitely did. But the good news is Congress is still getting paid. I want the names of the idiots who elected these people - oh, wait, it was us? Never mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something the Huffington Post reported, that while the Congressmen were allegedly trying to work out a deal last night, some of them were drinking. ? You'd think a bunch of drunk guys can get along. When I am drunk, I will agree to anything. I will help you move, tell you I love you, father a child with you. You name it. I guess that's not the same effect when you are in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crucial agencies like the US Border Patrol are still on the job. That's a good thing. The last thing we need is an influx of Canadians, with their politeness and a government that's open every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying now that before the government shutdown, congressmen went out and got drunk. Went out and got drunk, celebrating that they had shut down the government. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the kind of thing that could hurt, could damage their 10 percent approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have what they call now the Obamacare, and when you sign up for the Obamacare, you get different programs. You get the bronze program, you get the silver program, you get the gold program or the platinum. Now, people say to me, 'Dave, what is the difference?' Here's all I know: If you sign up for the platinum, you actually get to drive the ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But?it's another bad day for the American government. It's still shut down tighter than Bruce Jenner's forehead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Statue of Liberty is closed. No government means nobody's allowed near that beautiful gift from France. The French were like 'mehhh.' Then they heard about the Statue of Liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I don't think people are paying enough attention to fact that the National Zoo is closed. The panda cam has been dark for 48 hours. Who knows what craziness those pandas are up to now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, there was a report today that the CIA has stopped paying some of its spies. That's not good. What kind of democracy doesn't pay people for betraying their friends?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans are hoping Democrats will eventually give in. I'm not so sure. If you're waiting for Nancy Pelosi to blink, it may be a while. You know what I'm saying? I don't know if it's technically possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I may have over the past few days leading up to and through the government shutdown thrown around some rather derisive terms to describe those in Congress who have decided to not fund the government because of a past law they don't like went into effect. I might have mentioned the word idiot, dunderheads, morons. ... I guess my point is, I'd like to apologize because I realize I may have been way too easy on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government shut down. It just shut down. Now, we're in day two, now, of this whole mess and no one knows when the government will be back up and running. So, if you ever wanted to cut the tag off of your mattress, do it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because the government doesn't have any money, NASA had to close a Twitter account that warns the public about asteroids. So, if you're someone who constantly checks Twitter to see if an asteroid's coming, would an asteroid really make your life any worse?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several Washington reporters tweeted that multiple congressmen were visibly drunk in the moments right before the shutdown. It was pretty obvious. Just take a look at some of the bills they passed at the last minute. First, they passed the No Taco Left Behind Act. That's a good one. Next, there is a resolution making the official time in Washington 5:00 somewhere. Here's another one. It's a motion making Gatorade and cold pizza part of the food pyramid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more craziness in Washington, yesterday. Joe Biden was spotted holding a document with the word 'Classified' on it in front of a bunch of White House reporters. It's a real photo. ... 'Classified'. Right there. Yeah. Nothing says Joe Biden like the codeword for your classified document actually being called codeword. That's a real photo. Codeword, codeword. That's right, Joe Biden was waving around a classified document in front of reporters, but false alarm. It turns out it was just a bunch of cheat codes for Grand Theft Auto V.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Stockholm say hundreds of jellyfish have shut down a nuclear reactor. Hey, that's nothing. In our country, a bunch of spineless jellyfish have shut down the entire government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is shut down. Even Al Qaeda couldn't do that. Do you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, all nonessential employees were sent home, like president Obama's economic team. They all got sent home. Well, to all you nonessential employees that have been forced out of your job. Hey, I work for NBC, I know how you feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent poll of AOL users, 51 percent of respondents blame the Republicans for the shut down, while 49 percent blame the Democrats. Isn't that amazing? There are still people using AOL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the shutdown, even the Smithsonian Institute is closed. And as a result, tourists who come to Washington and want to see historical relics are now being sent to John McCain's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you can see the effects of the shutdown all over town, it's terrible. President Obama now down to just one teleprompter. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so bad, the animals at the National Zoo are being auctioned off to HomeTown Buffet. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so bad, Iran will be forced to negotiate with Dennis Rodman. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hurting everybody. In fact, Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry are being forced to use the same botox needle. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so bad, a lot of government workers are watching reruns of 'Breaking Bad' just to get the meth recipes. That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so bad, John Boehner can't afford tanning cream any more. He's just rubbing his face with Cheetos dust. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so bad, Harry Reid has been forced to change his own embalming fluid. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad you are here on day three of the government shutdown. During a speech in Maryland today, President Obama blamed the shutdown on House Speaker John Boehner and then John Boehner blamed it on the a-a-a-alcohol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see, we are really at a standstill, here. The shutdown is costing us $300 million a day. That is a full 'Ironman' sequel per day. We could be up to 'Ironman 7' by tomorrow, but we're not because of this.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they call nonessential government services have been put on hold. Flight safety inspectors have been furloughed. National monuments closed. Even the Grand Canyon, it's closed. They filled it with spackle too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Marlin Stutzman, which is not a name I made up - that is a real person. He is one of the Congressmen who's responsible for the shutdown. Marlin dug his heels in, and he said, 'We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.' That's what he said. Quite a rallying cry, by the way. 'What do we want? I have no idea! When do we want it? Couldn't possibly tell you.' Maybe if he didn't want to be disrespected, he shouldn't have run for Congress in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is taking advantage of the government shutdown, and it was announced earlier today that he has furloughed his mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks got signed up on the Obamacare? Got it right with you? Are you okay? Good. Here's what you got. You sign up, you have four plans, four ways to win and win big. You've got the bronze plan. You have the silver plan. You have the gold plan. You have the platinum plan. Now, let me break this down for you a little bit. If you go with the platinum plan, you get two choices. You get the morphine, if you need it. Or the morphine con queso.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three days. Three days. The National Zoo has been shut down for almost 90 hours. Inside the walls, adorable panda bears have risen up and formed their own society. And guess what? Even they were able to pass a budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now nation, it is day three of the government shutdown and it is a critical moment in our nation's history. And not just because yogurts left by furloughed Federal workers are passing their expiration date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to White House meetings on government shutdown) &quot;That's right, the only thing they've actually agreed on was that they made no progress. But that agreement is itself progress. So, the only thing they agreed on was wrong, and now we are back to square one. Now folks, Republicans don't want to shut the government down. They want to end this stalemate and get back to the important work of crippling the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the two parties are at a stalemate, but luckily the GOP has one of the stalest mates of all, Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman. He told the Washington Examiner, 'We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this, and I don't even know what that is.' There you have it, Mr. President. A clear signal of what Obama needs to offer: something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just tell Republicans if they agree to end this impasse they can get whatever is in this secret mystery box. I mean, what could it be? The complete dismantling of Obamacare, the Keystone XL pipeline, or is it a lovely dinette set courtesy of Broyhill?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama had an hour-long meeting with Republicans and Democrats, and they still were unable to end the situation. So, don't worry, while the shutdown is putting people out of work and costing people taxpayers millions of dollars, lawmakers did spend a whole hour trying to fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Disney World said it would help its employees sign up for Obamacare. Yeah. Disney World - they're going to help. So, finally Sneezy can get some Claritin, Sleepy can get some adderall, and Grumpy can get some Prozac. They need it, those dwarfs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how much you guys know about Obamacare, but the way it's supposed to work is that people can choose between several different price plans: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. But if none of those work for you, President Obama actually introduced a few other plans that are even cheaper. Like, here's a few of them right here, and the coverage you can expect from these. First, we have the cubic zirconium plan. Instead of a detailed mole check, your dermatologist gives you a bottle of sunscreen and offers to 'do' your back. ? Next, is the cement plan. It makes it legal for you to take someone else's medication if they feel like they're done with it. 'I think I'm healthy now. Want these pills? Take it.' After that, there's the wood plan. With that one, the doctor just looks at you and goes, 'eh, probably nothing.' Next, we have the what-evs plan. That's where a cashier at Walgreens guesses what's wrong with you. ? And lastly, there's the cardboard plan. It's just a card with WebMD.com on the front. That'll tell you what's wrong. Some good options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is day three of the shutdown, and right now 33 percent of the government is doing absolutely nothing. Which is not bad, considering before the shutdown 80 percent wasn't doing anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Obamacare does cover carpal tunnel syndrome. The result of pressing a computer trying to get through to stupid Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, regarding the problems of starting up Obamacare? President Obama...he made this analogy. He said, 'Hey, Apple had some glitches with the iPhone, but then they fixed them.' Technically the President is correct. But you got to remember, Apple has geniuses working there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, the shutdown is hurting everybody. Today, Michelle Obama told fat kids, 'You're on your own. Eat a damn Happy Meal. I don't care.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Referring to government shutdown) &quot;President Obama has switched to miniature golf. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Boehner today in the news? Boehner said he stayed by the phone all weekend waiting for the President, but he never called. What do you mean stayed by the phone? What is this, 1965?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the first Monday in October, which means the Supreme Court's new term began today. And they're expected to take up several divisive issues. Well, that's good, huh? I was afraid the country is becoming too unified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden accidentally showed the cover of a classified document to the press during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The file had 'classified' on it. And they got to see it. See, I never understood that. Why do you put 'classified' or 'top secret' on a file? You don't want people to read it, write 'Joe Biden speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bureau of Printing and Engraving and stuff that puts out money, put out new $100 bills. ??? The new $100 bill is different. First of all, it's only worth $10.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole mess with the shutdown isn't making anyone happy. A new survey found that 9% of Americans have considered giving up their US citizenship because of the constant arguing in Washington. ... Today, even Obama was like, 'Are you sure I wasn't born in Kenya? I never saw a birth certificate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you believe that? Nine percent of Americans would give up their citizenship because of all the fighting in DC. You know things are bad when people are getting caught at the Mexican border, and they're being sent back to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, we put our own survey about the shutdown. The answers were pretty surprising. ... First question was: What is the best solution to the congressional fighting? Ten percent said Democrats should negotiate with Republicans. Thirty-five percent said Republicans should give in and fund Obamacare. And finally, 55% said settle it 'Hunger Games' style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have just received breaking news about the government shutdown. Government, still shut down. In fact, midnight tonight is the shutdown's one-week anniversary, and I plan on marking the occasion by popping a bottle of bubbly. Not champagne, milk. Food inspectors have been furloughed and for some reason my milk is bubbling now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was day nine of the government shutdown. President Obama invited all 232 House Republicans to the White House to discuss the situation. But the Republicans only sent an 18-member delegation, which meant Michelle Obama got stuck with more than 200 brown rice-tofurkey burgers. You know the gluten-free seaweed buns do not keep. So that went badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's autumn, ladies and gentlemen, and because of the government shutdown, the leaves will not be changing color this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Day nine of the government shutdown. Are you like me? Are you beginning to miss the days when we were ruled by a mad English king?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say now that it's the Republicans that have caused the shutdown, or as they're also known, the Washington Whiteskins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what people are talking about. Of course, it's the debt ceiling. Again, we're talking about this, and things aren't going well. In fact, during a press conference yesterday, President Obama said that Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling, because there aren't any other, quote, 'rabbits in our hat.' Plus, they're still tired from their last trick where they made thousands of jobs disappear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, President Obama also called on John Boehner to stop coming up with excuses and hold a vote on ending the government shutdown. Boehner said he would schedule a vote, but he's washing his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just so much bickering with these guys. Even the ones on the same side. Just today, Senator Harry Reid said that he wanted to keep Joe Biden out of the debt-ceiling negotiations, because Biden gives up too much to Republicans. When asked how he got rid of Biden, Reid said, 'I just pretended to throw a tennis ball. That was easy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Census Bureau, since 2007, illegal immigration is decreasing. Less and less people are coming here. Here's how bad it's gotten. Women in Beverly Hills, now, a lot of them, forced to raise their own children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This came out today, American adults scored below the national average on math, reading, and problem-solving skills. Do we need a test to know that we're not good at problem solving? Can't we look at these morons in Washington and the shutdown to figure that out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security has a new slogan: 'If you see something, remember what it is and call us when we get back to the office.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, they said today, the government shutdown will not interfere with NASA's next mission to Mars. Isn't that ironic? We can go to Mars. We can't go to the Statue of Liberty, but we can go to Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shutdown is so bad, Harry Reid today was forced to take a part-time job as an extra on 'The Walking Dead.' That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was Day 10 of the government shutdown. At what point do we politely ask Canada to govern us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Republicans offered to raise the debt ceiling for six weeks, but they refused to end the shutdown, which was a nonstarter for President Obama. So, we're at a standstill once again. I will tell you this though: When President Obama and John Boehner finally do settle this, the makeup sex is going to be amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the debt ceiling isn't raised by Thursday, the country won't legally be allowed to borrow any more money and will be down to only $30 billion in cash, which China carries that much cash around in their pants. China even issued a warning today. We owe them more than a trillion dollars, like $1.3 trillion, and if we default on that, they've threatened to cut off our supply of cheap, plastic crap made by kids, which would be disastrous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exclusive gym where congressmen go to work out has remained open during all of this, although they were quick to point out the gym is not fully operational, because towel service is no longer available due to the shutdown. So, everyone is suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new chairman of the Fed is Janet Yellen. ... Janet Yellen is a banking genius. ... You know those pens?you go into a bank?she invented the chain that holds them. Next time you try to steal a pen, think of Janet Yellen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, now the next step is Congress will hold hearings to see if she's qualified. And I thought well, when are we going to hold hearings to see if Congress is qualified?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only 'progress' in Washington today is a website called DrunkDialCongress.org. It's true. It connects Americans who've been drinking - I think the technical term is drinking Americans - to the voicemail of a random congressman. I know. I'm as angry as anyone, but is this a good idea? Is it? Encouraging impaired morons who think the shutdown's some kind of joke to take calls from drunk people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner had a closed-door meeting to discuss the government shutdown. No word on how it went, although I did think it was super weird when they put a sock on the doorknob. Actually, people who listened in on this closed door meeting with John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, they thought they heard a woman crying and then being comforted by Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the approval rating of Congress has hit a record low of just five percent. There's a lot of pressing questions. Mainly, who's in that five percent that still approves of Congress? ? Actually, when they asked the five percent why they still approve of Congress, they were like, 'Oh, I'm sorry, we thought you said congas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, Congress has never been less popular. In fact, this new poll found that Americans have a better opinion of zombies than members of Congress, which is weird, because they're not that different from each other. I mean, take a look. First, we have zombies - they have creepy discolored skin, while Congress has John Boehner. Very orange-like skin. Here, zombies do a lot of moaning, whereas Congress does a lot of postponing. And last, zombies would destroy civilization as we know it. Congress, give it a few more days. There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys know I love going out to eat, but I don't know about this. I heard about this new restaurant here in New York that doesn't let customers talk to each other during their meals. Yeah. When they heard that, Obama and Republicans were like, 'Table for 200, please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the other day when California's health insurance exchange said that over five million people went to their website the first day of Obamacare? Turns out they were off by 4.4 million. Only 645,000 hits it got. Turns out those are from the same guy trying to log on over and over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You got to be careful with the Obamacare - a lot of scams associated with it. ... For example, guys, if you're at the airport, and the TSA agent grabs you and tells you to cough, that is not Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the TSA, they are now easing their policy on people carrying medical marijuana through security checkpoints in the airport. This will be a huge benefit to the 14 million people in L.A. who suffer from glaucoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel Prize for chemistry was announced this week. It was awarded to Sen. Ted Cruz for mixing up that batch of Kool-Aid that the Republicans seem to be drinking on Capitol Hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As for negotiating with the President, John Boehner said, 'I don't want to put anything on the table, and I don't want to take anything off the table.' Of course not. Like most congressmen, they like to do business under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Georgia Republican Congressman Phil Gingrey, I think that's his name. He said it's time for his party to have a 'Braveheart' moment for the American people. Really, a 'Braveheart' moment? This whole government shutdown feels like another Mel Gibson movie: 'Ransom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has an approval rating of five percent. Is that still technically an approval rating? Isn't that really a 95% disapproval rating?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economists now say if the government spending exceeds the debt ceiling, consumers won't be able to get credit cards with a favorable rate anymore. Oh, yeah. That will take some getting used to, huh? I mean, for so long the credit companies have been spoiling us with those fabulous 30% interest rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a bill allowing children in California to have more than two legal parents. Ironically, most kids in California have two illegal parents. So kind of a switch from that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Today was day 14 of the government shutdown. I am starting to forget what it is like to have a government. There is a guy with big ears and a suit that talked about hope. That is all gone. Just when you think that Congress could not do anything less, they manage to. At this point the government is like a house on Halloween that turns out the lights and leaves a bowl of candy on the front porch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

If the government ever does default, if we do just completely go belly-up, the festivities - and I think that's the right word - the festivities when the government goes belly-up will be hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the government defaults we will lose our ability to borrow money. Forget that, we will not be able to borrow money, and also we will lose our membership in Sam's Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember George W. Bush? We didn't know about this, but he had heart surgery?and they had to clear up a blockage with heart surgery. Maybe we should try that on the Tea Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently George W. Bush's heart trouble was much worse than anyone imagined and so were his two terms in office, as it turns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress finally got off their [expletive] and reopened the government. ? Congress says there's a deal in place, but remember - they're Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think we should do? ? If any member of the legislature, a congressman or senator, has served in this particular session, I say we vote them out. ... All of them. Democrats, Republicans, you clearly don't know what you're doing. I'm saying we let Leno do it. Leno is not going to have much to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's deal caught everyone in Congress by surprise, except Nancy Pelosi. She always looks like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, some underlying issues still remain. Republicans oppose tax increases. Democrats oppose benefit cuts. And John McCain opposes kids on his lawn, because he's old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that now is not the time to point fingers. Well let me know when it is. I've got one for him and the rest of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all in a good mood. That's the important thing. And we should be in a good mood, ladies and gentlemen. As of what, Andy, like two, three hours ago, looks like Congress has finally made a deal to reopen the government. Now, if you want to know how this affects you, tomorrow the Washington Zoo panda cam is coming back online! That's what we're going to notice. Yeah, those pandas got fat!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has said the day after the budget deal is made, he's going to concentrate on immigration. He says?he will start by deporting Ted Cruz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there had been a debt default tomorrow, a top credit agency said it would have downgraded America's triple-A rating. Downgraded it. Yeah, even worse, the Treasury Department had been flooded with offers to try the Discover Card. And they were thinking of doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Televangelist Pat Robertson shocked Republicans by telling them to accept defeat. Robertson said it's time to get back to reality, blaming hurricanes on gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John McCain said the shutdown was, quote, 'one of the most shameful things he's seen as a senator.' Yeah, that's from a guy who saw Lincoln get shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
