<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Floyd Landis...winning the tour de France. How about that? This is now the eighth time in a row an America has gone through France and into Paris, which is pretty good. Eight times. Even the Germans only did it twice.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot in Washington, people were sweating like President Bush trying to spell Hezbollah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Condoleezza Rice went into President Bush's office and said, 'I'm off to Lebanon.' And President Bush said, 'Vacation?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he understands the situation. Like today, he was asked about the movement of the Lebanese, and he said he just wishes Rosie O'Donnell well when she goes to 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said today that if he were president, the current conflict in the Middle East would not be happening. Then his wife Theresa said, 'Yes I know, dear, just take out the trash.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il married his secretary. Again, a problem on their wedding night. Just trouble launching that missile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made an interesting statement. She said technology is getting so intrusive, she fears that some have a computer chip implanted in their brains. She said she is against that idea. Hover, she said she wouldn't mind having a Lojack installed in Bill's ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Senator Bob Dole. Bob Dole turned 83 on Saturday. Happy birthday to Bob. Want to wish him the best. Bob said today -- he said today, every year is a little harder for him, thanks to Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Friday, 'American Idol' winner Taylor Hicks will go to the White House to meet with President Bush. That's pretty cool. Isn't it? Imagine awkward Southern guy who nobody thought could win anything sitting down, with the American idol, Taylor Hicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Senator Joe Lieberman. Clinton got the crowd so worked up that they had trouble sleeping through the Lieberman speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend congratulations Kim Jong-Il got married. North Korean dictator. Congratulations to his new bride Marcy Schneiderman-Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-Il's honeymoon is going well, last night he successfully test fired a short range missile.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see the weather map on the back of USA Today? I have never seen this before. All the states are red. All the states are red. It's like Karl Rove's dream come true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Al Gore, if you're watching, we give up! You won! You were right! Al, make it stop!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you realize if Al Gore is right, and the polar ice caps do melt, the entire state of Florida would be under water, and he could finally win a presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heat wave in Europe, just as bad. In fact, some countries in Europe may have to declare a state of emergency. In fact, I understand the US government is prepared to airlift more than 60 tons of deodorant into France if necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Beirut today. Not on official business -- just cooler there. She just wanted to cool off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry said over the weekend if he were president, the current conflict in the Middle East wouldn't be happening because he would be more involved in the Middle East. More involved? Hey, Bush invaded the place! How could he get more involved than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Humanitarian aid from the US has begun to arrive in Lebanon. The US government sent 10,000 medical kits, 20,000 blankets, $30 million cash. And today the people in New Orleans said, 'They did what?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how it works these days. Troubled areas of the world like the Middle East, they get American humanitarian aid. Untroubled areas like India -- well, they just get American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran today called for a boycott of all US-made goods. Well, we got them there. Hey, Iran, we don't make anything in the US anymore!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein had to be taken to the hospital after being on a hunger strike for 17 days. 17 days, which sounds impressive until you realize Nicole Richie hasn't eaten in 18 months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gas continuing to go up. To give you an idea of how expensive gas is, Keith Olbermann has be carpooling with Bill O'Reilly all week.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a ballot initiative here in California that would increase the cigarette tax 300%. This would make California the first state where the sex is actually cheaper than the cigarette you have afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman who practices voodoo was fined $1,000 for carrying a human head on an airplane flight from Haiti to Florida. Tell me if I understand this right. You're caught with a human head on the plane, you get fined $1000. You get caught with nail clippers on the plane, you go to jail, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Friday, American Idol winner Taylor Hicks will go to the White House and meet the President of the United States. Say what you want about Bush he knows how to delegate. 'Condoleezza, you go to Beirut. I'm gonna be meeting with the American Idol on Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so hot here in New York City, today the terror alert has been raised to gazpacho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so hot today, Hillary Clinton was at the beach in a one-piece pant suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Kim Jong Il, got married over the weekend, recently married. I'm sure he and Ellen Barkin will be very happy, so congratulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Bill Clinton is &quot;campaigning for Senator Joe Lieberman. This was great. They go to the function, and Clinton whips the crowd into a frenzy, whips the crowd into a frenzy, and then Lieberman comes out and whips them into a coma.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Kennedy announced today, because of global warming, he'll no longer be doing any flaming Jell-o shots.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This doesn't even seem possible. I am not making this up. A Tomahawk cruise missile fell off a truck in the Bronx this week. You see that? Fell off the truck. What rapper is that going to?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what that means? There are now more weapons of mass destruction in the Bronx than there are in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush trying to bring about a cease-fire in the Mid East. He sent a gift to the president of Lebanon and his wife. But again, I don't think he understands the situation. See what he sent them? Hizbollah and Herbollah towels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know Ann Coulter. She was on CNBC, today. And this is what she said. She said Bill Clinton is gay. She said Bill Clinton is gay. Please. Just because she's the only woman on the planet he wouldn't have sex with, doesn't make him gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AT&amp;T says in the second quarter their profits increased by 81%. 81%. So apparently, the government is paying them to listen to our phone calls.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so hot down in Washington, DC, George Bush was giving back rubs to Eskimos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, ladies and gentlemen, Condoleezza Rice has been unable, unable to negotiate a cease-fire between Christie Brinkley and her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, and he spent the first hour trying to pronounce Nouri al-Malaki.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Saddam Hussein? I'm beginning to think the guy is whacky. He now says that if he's found guilty he would like to be shot. Sounds look a job for Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's day five, day five of Kim Jung-Il's marriage, the crazy North Korean dictator married. A couple of nights ago he tried to consummate his marriage, and his wife became physically ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four days after his victory in the Tour de France, Floyd Landis has tested positive for high levels of testosterone, which is pretty unbelievable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has sent a bill to President Bush that will set up a national database of convicted sex offenders on the Internet. Don't we have this already? It's called MySpace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in St. Paul, Minnesota, have caught the 81-year-old father of US Senator Norm Coleman having sex in the parking lot of a pizza parlor with a 38-year-old woman. God bless him! 81 years old!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police asked him why he didn't wait until he got home. He said, 'At my age, I can't take a chance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the CNBC show, &quot;The Big Idea With Donny Deutsch,' Ann Coulter said Bill Clinton is gay. That's what I think she said. You know, it's hard to understand her with that Adam's apple bobbing up and down all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what she said, Bill Clinton is gay. And today, Clinton told Hillary, 'That's what I've been trying to tell you. Those women are all liars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, that North Korea launched a long-range popsicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is one of those new frightening, awful videos from al Qaeda, and, apparently, they think that it's recent because in the video, they criticize America, they criticize Israel, and they criticize Christie Brinkley's husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein says now if he's found guilty he prefers to be shot rather than hanged. But here in the United States, there is a third option. You can move to Florida and play golf.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tour de France winner Floyd Landis has tested positive for high levels of testosterone. ... No, Landis said that his first results were a false positive. Sounds like a John Kerry answer, doesn't it? False positive. Yes and no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he's already taken a second test, and if he passes that one he'll be fine. If he fails that one, then of course, he'll have to play major league baseball.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever you win in a sport, they automatically accuse you of having banned substances in your bloodstream. You know what that means? The only pure sport left now is bowling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Hezbollah is said to be hiding in the Iranian embassy in Lebanon. President Bush said today he once spent the night there. And then his staff told him, 'No, Mr. President, those were Embassy Suites.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the most ridiculous story of the week, this week Ann Coulter said that Bill Clinton was gay. I've got to admit, he hides it pretty well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is ridiculous. Ann Coulter thinks Bill Clinton is gay. But she also thinks George Bush is smart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in St. Paul, Minnesota caught the 81-year-old father of US Senator Norm Coleman having sex in the parking lot of a pizza parlor with a 38-year-old woman. Senator Coleman is a Republican, but apparently his father is a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened in Washington? President Bush hosted the 'American Idol' finalists in the Oval Office. Well, sure, there's not really anything else going on. What's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bush is very, very busy. Tomorrow he meets with the 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's fascinating, this Taylor Hicks, you know who I'm talking about? He's the big 'American Idol' winner and he won by four million votes more than President Bush won his election. This is true. Coincidentally, so did Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, President Bush held a press conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. And then he met with the American idol Taylor Hicks. Those are our two last remaining allies, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spent hours talking about a possible solution to the Mideast crisis until staffers had to pull him aside and say, 'Hey, that's Taylor Hicks. Prime Minister Blair is still outside.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives has voted to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour, or as Wal-Mart called it, the end of the world as we know it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in St. Paul, Minnesota, I mentioned this the other night, caught the 81-year-old father of US Senator Norm Coleman having sex in the parking lot of a pizza parlor with a 38-year-old woman. 81 years old. They caught him because someone called the police to say that an 81-year-old man was having sex in a car with a young girl. Turned out it was him. He was bragging. He just wanted everyone to know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Miami are celebrating tonight because Fidel Castro has temporarily stepped down. He's had to undergo surgery. So he's transferred his presidential power to his brother, Jeb Castro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Castro's brother's name is Raul. As soon as his brother, Raul, found out he was taking over, he turned his raft around, went back to Havana.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Castro took over in 1959. He's the longest-reigning dictator in power, currently. Well, if you don't count Martha Stewart, yeah. He would be the longest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Castro, he's going to be 80 years old. He's talking about retiring. You know what that means? He could wind up in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newspapers in Israel are now starting to question their government's actions in Lebanon. The critics say Israeli leaders underestimated the strength of the enemy, didn't have a well-thought out military plan, and may have gotten them bogged down in a quagmire fighting a guerrilla war in a foreign country. Well, thank God our leaders would never let anything like that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Iran has ordered his government to ban foreign words for cultural usage. They only want Iranian words. You can't use any foreign words. For example, pizza is not called pizza in Iran. It's called elastic loaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other foreign words Iran is banning are peace, negotiation, and nuclear disarmament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an odd story -- a candidate for the president of the Congo has called a press conference to deny that he is a cannibal and said he has never eaten any pygmy. That's what he said. Finally, a candidate who cares about the little people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Nobel prize-winning scientist has come up with what he says is a plan to save the world from global warming. This is interesting. He wants to fill giant balloons with sulfur and then release the gas by shooting ammunition at the balloons. That sound like a good idea? I mean, if bullets and toxic gas prevent global warming, LA would be the healthiest city in the world. Wouldn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers at Columbia University found that overweight women are constantly bombarded with negative messages. Except for messages left by Bill Clinton. Those are positive. But the others are pretty negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 81-year-old father of US Senator Norm Coleman was arrested for having sex in the parking lot of a pizza parlor with a 38-year-old woman. Today, the judge asked him how he pled. He said extremely happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has checked into the hospital, and control of the country has been turned over to his brother, yeah. ... In a related story, control of Castro's beard has been turned over to ZZ Top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a lab report found that Tour de France winner Floyd Landis had too much testosterone in his body during the race. Yeah, in Landis' defense -- everyone seems like they're full of testosterone when they're surrounded by Frenchmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see the other night President Bush almost tripped and fell down the steps of Air Force One? Did you see that trip? Yeah, looked like Lindsay Lohan on her way to work. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations today to Anna Nicole Smith. She just became Mrs. Fidel Castro. So how about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the elderly Fidel Castro recovering from surgery in Cuba. It was pretty serious. I understand he was rushed to the hospital on Donkey One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a message delivered on Cuban television today said that Fidel Castro's condition is listed as stable, which in communist countries means, 'He'll be dead by Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know it's ridiculous. Castro, he still appears in public with the green military fatigues like he's a soldier. What is he? 80? That's like Clinton going out in public wearing his wedding ring. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, that in the event that Castro does die, he has a plan in place to show the Cuban people that there's a better way than the plan they're currently living under. Hey, forget Cuba. How about showing us that plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech in Florida, President Bush praised all the contributions that Cubans have made to America. Catching, hitting, outfielding, shortstop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had his annual medical exam this week. A doctor said the President remains in excellent health and is fit for duty. In fact, so fit, today, the National Guard today called and said, 'So how about serving your time now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the doctor said his heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol level are all pretty good. The only bad number, his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they said the President is in excellent health from the neck down. Other than that...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after the President received a clean bill of health, Floyd Landis offered Bush 100 bucks for his urine sample.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times is now reporting that&quot; Floyd Landis &quot;had fake testosterone in his body. See, I don't know if this is true, but let this be a lesson for all athletes out there. Only buy your performance-enhancing drugs from reputable drug dealers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Undercover investigators told Congress today -- and this was a test -- that they were able to cross the US/Mexican border using fake IDs. They all had fake IDs. They got in. Isn't that amazing? Since when do you need an ID to cross the border to Mexico?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Condoleezza Rice has been extremely busy this week. Shuttling back and forth between Israel and Mel Gibson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does not look good for Mel. A lot of people very upset over his anti-Semitic remarks. In fact, even Louis Farrakhan said, 'I can't believe what he said about the Jews. I can't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuban dictator Fidel Castro is still in the hospital with a serious medical condition. Yeah, Castro says that a half century of communist rule seems like a good idea, right up until the part where he was rushed to the hospital in '55 Oldsmobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, violence in the Middle East continued with Israel bombing Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon. Yeah. Then today, Israel launched an attack on Mel Gibson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this week, angry political protesters have been shutting down traffic in Mexico City. Yeah. As a result, thousands of Mexicans were unable to get to their jobs in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had his annual physical this week. Doctors say the President is in excellent shape. The country's gone to hell, but the President...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report shows that President Bush has no history of disease, including sexually transmitted diseases. No sexually transmitted diseases. Believe me, President Bush was relieved to hear that. He was always worried he might have caught something from Clinton's old office chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One kind of funny moment during the colonoscopy. The doctor said, 'I don't have an exit plan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is in the report, the doctors did report that President Bush is actually shrinking. That happens as you get older. They measured him, he's a quarter of an inch smaller than he was last year. And Bob Dole told him, 'Try some viagra. That ought to work.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Cuba, doctors today said Fidel Castro is recovering and they said he is in better shape than the next guy, assuming that's Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Castro's condition has been listed as stable, but homeless looking condition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah was seen on Lebanese TV today criticizing Israel. And afterwards he apologized and entered a rehab facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House has approved a minimum wage hike. When it comes to doing the minimum for their wage, Congress knows what it's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Floyd Landis, the Tour de France winner, was supposed to be on our show last week, then he cancelled. He was supposed to be on tonight, he canceled again. Again! Come on, Floyd, show some testosterone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has been out of sight for so long, there's a rumor that he's dead. Yeah, people are saying that Castro is either dead or has a show on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean leader Kim Jong Il sent a message to Fidel Castro, wishing him a speedy recovery. Yeah, the card said, 'Hey, crazy beard, feel better soon. Love, giant sunglasses.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said the President has no history of heart disease or stroke. Apparently, he just talks like that all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush flew out to his Prairie Chapel ranch in Crawford, Texas, to begin his 11-day vacation. It's not really a ranch. There's no cows or horses. It's more like an estate, but ranch sounds better. So like when you call Iraq a democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally President Bush would take six weeks off. This time he's only taking 11 days, because the White House says he has too many things to do. Like he's out campaigning. You know, for other Republicans, raising money. Today, all the Republicans up for re-election said, 'Uh -- take the six weeks. We're okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Senator Hillary Clinton went after Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Really went after him. Said he had a bad track record. And she asked him why she should trust him. You get the feeling maybe she's been burned by a guy before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate voted against -- against -- raising the minimum wage yesterday. And Wal-Mart employees are furious. They said we never would have come to this country illegally if we knew we were going to be treated this way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush made a speech about immigration at the border between Texas and Mexico. That's good. Yeah. There was an awkward moment when an illegal immigrant interrupted Bush and said, 'Can you give me directions to Dallas?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then after the speech, President Bush traveled to his ranch in Texas for a ten day vacation. The President says now is the perfect time for him to take a vacation while everything in the world is running so smoothly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you here. Thank you very much. What a crowd! You sound like the oil company executives after they shut down the Alaska pipeline. Ah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British Petroleum Alaska pipeline, which sends out over 400,000 barrels a day, has been shut down because of corrosion and a small oil spill. Yeah. And I thought this was nice. Out of respect for the already hard-hit American consumer, gas station owners waited a full minute before climbing the ladder to raise the prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, gas is so expensive now, earlier today in Crawford, Texas, President Bush was seen carpooling with Cindy Sheehan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush currently on vacation in Texas. Ooh, take a break. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he said he's gonna try and do absolutely nothing for the next ten days. No, no. His advisers think this is the best way to bring his approval rating up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House officials said today President Bush took three books with him to Texas. Three! That pretty much empties the entire Bush library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush said, while he's on vacation, he's reading two books about his hero, Abraham Lincoln. That's his hero. And this has got his staff a little worried. See, they know how much President Bush idolizes Lincoln, and the feeling is it's going to be very upsetting for him when he gets to the part of the book where Lincoln gets shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Lincoln was the first Republican president. He was later shot by actor John Wilkes Booth. Thus, the beginning of the feud between actors and Republican presidents continuing to this day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times reported this story. Front page of the New York Times. On a trip to Estonia, Senator McCain and Hillary Clinton got into a vodka-drinking contest. No, no, see, that shows you how two sides can get together. When a McCain and a Clinton can both end up acting like a Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hillary asked him if he wanted to go out for a cold one, Senator McCain said, 'Oh, no thanks. I'm married.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the news is not good from Cuba. There are reports of a major medical crisis regarding Fidel Castro. Yeah, looks like he's getting better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to make sure they don't have any problems like last year, FEMA announced today they are closing for hurricane season.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, when President Bush is down there on his ranch, he likes to spend his time clearing brush and choppin' wood. Because you know, no matter how much legislation you pass to cut down trees, there's nothing like destroying them with your own hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, no news out of Cuba about Fidel Castro's condition. Well, they're releasing news. They're saying they've -- but nobody's seen him. Nobody's seen him since his operation. Some people are speculating he might be brain dead, which -- imagine that, a country with a president who's brain dead? Thank God that could never happen here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush denied that Iraq is close to a civil war, saying, 'Civil war? What civil war?' Coincidentally, that's the same thing Bush used to say in his American history class.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors in Utah were able to successfully separate those conjoined twins. That was a terrific story. However, sadly, in Connecticut, they weren't able to separate Joe Lieberman from President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Joe Lieberman lost his own party's nomination yesterday. He was beat by newcomer Ned Lamont, or you might know him as 'Who? What?'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to Joe Lieberman's credit, he was just as dull in defeat as he would have been in victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were stunned. I mean, he could have been vice president. Well, he was vice president of the United States for a short time. But given how bad Lieberman got beat, even Mel Gibson felt sorry for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people think Joe Lieberman lost because of the kiss that President Bush gave him at the State of the Union Address. You see that picture? So let be a little lesson for all you Democratic senators out there. If you want to keep your job, don't make out with President Bush in public, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Mexico, they had big, big protests over their election, too. Some Mexicans are so angry -- listen to this -- they are vowing to actually stay in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran announced today they have cloned a sheep. They plan to use the sheep to pull the wool over the UN's eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that people marching the streets of Baghdad shows that democracy is working and the Iraqis will be our allies in the war on terrorism. You know, as soon they're done chanting, 'Death to America!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has ruled out sending troops to Lebanon. You know what that means. No oil there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you now, that Alaskan pipeline had to be shut down earlier this week because all the pipes have corroded. They're all corroding. Officials said the pipeline has been operating for 30 years, but it's only meant to last for 25 years. Well, who could have foreseen that coming, huh?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If only the oil companies had some profits, they could have fixed this thing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just thank goodness we are not dependent on domestic oil. We can count on our friends in the Middle East to come in when we need them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal today, the United States may ease entry rules for some people leaving Cuba, like doctors. Doctors can leave now with no problem. Gee, I wonder why the Bush Administration wants to doctors to leave Cuba right now, almost like they were working on somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beautiful actress Lindsay Lohan says she wants to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton and entertain the troops. Okay, Lindsay I can see, but how is Hillary gonna entertain the troops? Boy, there's one lap dance you don't want to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said that Hillary is trying to work it out so they can go, but it seems too dangerous. In fact, that's what Bill said to them. Bill Clinton said, 'It is too dangerous. Lindsay, you stay here. Hillary, you go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a study at the Ohio State University cancer center, a little fat once in a while is good for you. To which Bill said to Hillary, 'See?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While on vacation, President Bush -- I guess this was in the paper today -- reportedly is reading a book about Abraham Lincoln. Or as President Bush calls him, 'The guy from the pennies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lindsay Lohan announced that she wants to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton to entertain the troops. Yeah. When the troops heard this, they asked, 'Why does the hot girl always have to bring a dumpy friend?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration is preparing to ease immigration rules for Cubans who want to live in the United States. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Which explains why Mexicans have started sneaking into Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a happy crowd. You obviously didn't come from the airport, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know US and British authorities foiled a terrorist plot. Plan to blow up planes mid-air. Unbelievable. How frightening is that? That makes flying almost as dangerous as Amtrak now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the good old days when the only bomb you had to worry about on the plane was the Rob Schneider movie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, British authorities said they were able to detect the terrorist plot using a surveillance program that the New York Times hadn't gotten around to exposing yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, they're not letting anyone on planes anymore with liquids or beverages of any kind. No beverages of any kind. That's why the huge delays. The pilots are hanging around the gates chugging their beers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Back in London, you can't even bring toothpaste on the plane, which I guess if you're English is not that big of a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No hair gel. Can't bring hair gel. How's Al Sharpton going to fly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush is on his summer vacation. Whew, take a break. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, creepy moment for President Bush today at his Texas ranch. Did you hear about this? He was in some bushes, clearing away brush, suddenly came face-to-face with George Michael with a truck driver...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, let's see. President Bush got a ten-day vacation, Congress is on a month-long vacation and Joe Lieberman is on a permanent vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Joe Lieberman lost his own party's endorsement. And, you know, I think Lieberman's in denial. He's not taking it well. Like today, he blamed the primary loss on his naturally high level of testosterone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this election was seen as a rejection of President Bush's strategy in Iraq. See, that's when you know your policies are unpopular when you get the other guy in the other party kicked out of office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Joe Lieberman's father used to own a liquor store? In fact, that's how he met the Kennedys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why Iran cloned the sheep? Do you know why they did this? You know, they don't have the sophisticated missile technology, so they needed something that could deliver a nuclear device.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS reporter Mike Wallace has scored an exclusive interview with the president of Iran. I don't think Mike Wallace is old, but the last time he interviewed the leader of Iran it was Ali Baba, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American Bar Association has approved a resolution condemning -- condemning -- President Bush's practice of writing exemptions to legislation to be signed in to law. Sometimes presidents will sign a law and then goes, 'Doesn't apply to me.' See, they criticized Bush. You ever notice that? The bar association never criticizes Cheney, because they know Cheney shoots lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man has been arrested for trying to smuggle three illegal aliens in to California from Mexico sewn in the upholstery of his car. ... Officials became suspicious when they noticed the two backseat cushions arguing with each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Dixie Chicks had to cancel 14 shows in their tour because of slow ticket sales. Yeah, and there's some concern they're losing the fan base. How ironic is that? They have something in common with President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the current issue of Elle magazine, Lindsay Lohan says she wants to go along with Hillary Clinton to Iraq to help entertain the troops. Actually, that'd be a pretty good team. I mean, after Lindsay gets the troops heated up, they bring in Hillary to cool them back down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the terrorist plot, airport officials are now confiscating, this is true, all shampoos and hair gels. You go to the airport, they're gonna take away your shampoo and your hair gel. Yeah. In other words, Ryan Seacrest is grounded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of heightened security concerns, many flights -- many flights from Britain to the United States were canceled today. Yeah, passengers were furious until they learned that the in-flight movie was 'Basic Instinct 2.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, of course -- he's responding to the crisis by -- he's on vacation. That's his plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush is &quot;urging his staff to join the 100 degree club, but running three miles in 100 degree heat. That's what he's telling people to do. Yeah. Yeah, experts say it's proof that the president can come up with a bad idea at any level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, scientists in Iran announced that they have successfully cloned a sheep. Yeah. Apparently, it's all part of their plan to fire sheep at Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration is preparing to ease immigration rules for Cubans who want to live in the United States. Which is kind of nice. ... The rule changes are being supported by Cuban-American lobby groups and by Major League Baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm driving to work, I see the huge line outside our studio today. I get excited. And I realized, it's not for our show. It's the check-in line for Burbank airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now, the airlines are saying no more hair gels, shampoos, makeup or hair spray allowed in carry-on bags. Who's attacking us, drag queens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also said men cannot carry on shaving cream. Why? When was the last time you saw an Islamic militant guy with a can of shaving cream?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials say part of the terrorist plot was to conceal explosive gel inside sports drinks. Well, we happened to get a bottle of that. Bill, hand me that, would you? If you ever see this around, this is al Qaeda-ade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The terrorists called that liquid potion they were making 'Mother of Satan.' Which is what Mel Gibson now calls tequila, 'Mother of Satan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that offends me, 'Mother of Satan.' Why do you have to bring Satan's mother into this? You can't blame the mom for the way the kid turns out. I'm sure Mrs. Satan did the best she could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On some flights the only things the airlines are letting you take on is passport and cash. The passport, of course, is for identification. The cash, so they can sell you a bottle of water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials say that these terrorists targeted United, American, and Continental Airlines. You know what that means? Even terrorists won't fly Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush said the United States is still under the threat of attack, and then he went back on vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He came out, 'Yeah, we're still being attacked. I'll be back at the ranch, got some brush to clear.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't think President Bush really understands the severity of this situation. Like, when they first told about the terrorist plot against the airlines, he said, 'Let me guess, snakes on a plane, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of the suspected terrorists made what they call 'martyrdom videos.' You know what those are? You appear on tape. It's your final farewell, the last time people ever see you. Like having a show on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, we have to give a tremendous amount of credit to both the US and the British intelligence agencies for the good work they did in exposing this terrorist plot. Pretty amazing. But you know something? With all our intelligence gathering capabilities, we still don't know if Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston are engaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now they're saying all this terrorist activity could lead to higher oil prices. And when asked why, the oil companies said, 'Because everything leads to higher oil prices.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of crude oil could hit $80 a barrel. Boy, that's not crude. That's obscene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how expensive gas is getting, in Pennsylvania Amish country, there has been a rash of horse and buggy jackings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it me or is Cheney starting to look more and more like the Penguin from the old Batman movies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Tuesday, Senator Joe Lieberman lost his party's endorsement. Not taking it well. In fact, last night I understand he went out drinking with Mel Gibson. Yeah, not taking it well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top official in England said -- this is a quote ? 'Britain is living through its most frightening time since the Second World War.' Yeah. Of course, he wasn't counting that three year run by the Spice Girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, a mild earthquake shook Mexico City. Yeah. Fortunately, no residents of Mexico City were hurt, 'cause they're all living in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying the entire case against John Mark Karr was completely bogus. It was based on a bunch of ridiculous claims he just made up without any basis in fact. He made the whole thing up. The good news, today the White House offered him a job.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans. FEMA officials said it seems like just yesterday when they first arrived in New Orleans, and then they realized, oh, it was just yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was down there for the anniversary. The crowd was really excited Bush was coming -- until they realized, it was President Bush, not Reggie Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush toured several neighborhoods that are still mostly empty. And he had Dick Cheney coming along, you know, to shoot any looters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professors at Iowa State University say they're trying to find a way to turn fuel ethanol, you know, ethanol we use in our cars, into alcohol that people can drink. Well, that makes sense. Oh, yeah, you know, we have this huge oversupply of gasoline and such a short small liquor supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Leading astronomers have gotten together and decided that Pluto is no longer a planet. Today Pluto was on the Dr. Phil show...and Dr. Phil told Pluto, 'Don't let them diminish you, you still have value.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I'm sad that Pluto is no longer a planet. Is that the best choice of planet to get rid of, Pluto? See, people like Pluto. If you want to get rid of a planet, drop Uranus. That's the embarrassing one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, you know where he is? He's in New Orleans right now to mark the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Now if we could just get FEMA down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, ladies and gentlemen, is the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It's the one-year anniversary today. Yeah. Not only that, it's the six-month anniversary of when President Bush found out about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, two Fox News journalists who had been kidnapped in the Middle East were released. Isn't that nice? ... Afterwards, the Fox News journalists said, 'It was the worst experience since being trapped at the Christmas party with Geraldo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting fact about the JonBenet Ramsey case. Did you know not one of the original Boulder police investigators is still working for that department? They all have executive jobs now with FEMA.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans was marked by President Bush with a moment of silence. A little over a year ago, when President Bush marked the occasion by a week and a half of silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I think President Bush gets confused. Like he said progress is being made in New Orleans, and he hopes one day New Orleans will be a democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because as you know, hurricanes, they hate freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, NBC anchor Brian Williams, he does our NBC News here, he interviewed President Bush, and President Bush said -- because he asked him about his poll numbers. And Bush said, 'The key for me is to keep expectations low.' Well, I think you can accurately say, 'Mission Accomplished.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Germany has offered to send troops to the Lebanon border. You can bet Israel's breathing a sigh of relief there. Because nothing makes Jewish people feel safer and more secure than having the German army marching on their border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's kind of a whacky story. President Bush is on television giving a speech -- did you hear about this -- and Kyra Phillips, an anchor woman from CNN, during the coverage of the speech, she gets up to go to the bathroom, she's wearing a mike phone. She leaves the microphone on. Everybody is outraged. And I said to myself, 'Wait a minute. What's the big deal? She went to the restroom during a George Bush speech. My God, who hasn't done that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the President of Iran -- did you hear about this -- challenged President Bush to a televised debate. President Bush turned down the debate, but did challenge the Iranian president to a game of 'Hungry Hungry Hippos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge in Michigan has ruled that the government's phone spying case -- remember the government listening in on the phone calls? Well, the judge says President Bush has broken the law and violated the Constitution. Or as they call it at the White House, Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week while in New Orleans, President Bush visited the home of rock 'n' roll legend Fats Domino. Although President Bush, trying to be politically correct, kept referring to him as Big Bones Domino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well experts are now predicting the price of gas will drop to around $2.00 a gallon by Thanksgiving. Is that really good news? Is that good news? Okay, follow this through. Cheap gas by Thanksgiving? No, how about after Thanksgiving. Because, listen to this. If you do it Before thanksgiving, relatives who couldn't afford to visit you before will now be showing up in droves. Let's hold it a week. 'Oh, I'm sorry you couldn't make it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran today defied the UN's demands that they halt their nuclear program. You know what happens when you defy the UN? Well, they are now bracing themselves for an angry letter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, CBS has gotten in a little bit of hot water for digitally air brushing a picture of Katie Couric in the September issue of 'Watch' magazine that makes her look 20 pounds lighter than she really is. Have you heard about this? Here's my question. Why doctor Katie's picture? She looks great. How about doing something with Andy Rooney's photo, okay? Can we clean that up? Maybe get a weed whacker on those eyebrows of his. She looks fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Hilton has booked herself on the first private space shuttle trip into outer space. Nicole Richie was gonna go, but then she realized, I'm already weightless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the big holiday weekend coming up? If you leave for the airport now, you should be through security by Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, ladies and gentlemen, here at CBS was Bob Schieffer's last night as the anchor of the 'CBS Evening News.' Last night, yes. Tremendous man. Bob brought credibility and ratings to the news. So naturally they got rid of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this well? First of all, Katie Couric, who was the host of the 'Today show', remember the 'Today Show' with Katie Couric. And they fired Katie over there at NBC. And you know what it was, they caught her stealing that clear nail polish. They caught her stealing it, and so, CBS, you know, always interested in snapping up a bargain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they bring Katie over here, she will be on the 'CBS Evening News.' They doctored the photos to make her look 20 pounds lighter, 20 pounds thinner. And I'm thinking well hell, if you can do that, why don't you take 20 pounds off that lousy Dr. Phil?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Top Ten Kyra Phillips Excuses:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. How was I supposed to know we had a reporter embedded in the bathroom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. I honestly never knew this sort of thing was frowned upon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. I was set up by those bastards at Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Like you've never gone to the bathroom and had it broadcast on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. I just wanted that hunky Lou Dobbs to notice me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Okay, so I was drunk and I couldn't think straight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You been reading about this guy? Authorities say he's fathered over 250 children. Like a one-man NBA team, this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two hundred fifty kids. You know who I feel sorry for? The middle child. You know, because it's always the 125th kid that gets the least attention. You know what I'm saying? So sad, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about those hand-me-downs? By the time those clothes get to kid 250, those jeans are pretty rank.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. What is the protocol if you're friends with a polygamist? I mean, at what point do you stop buying wedding gifts? By the 25th blender it's like, 'All right, enough with this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States and Europe say they're ready to begin imposing low-level sanctions against Iran, such as travel bans. Travel bans. That's going to ruin a lot of people's Labor Day weekend. How many were going to Tehran this weekend? Aw.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Labor Day weekend, one of the biggest three-day travel weekends of the year. Now, if you don't want to spend a lot of money on gas, here's what you do. This is pretty good. You tell the Boulder, Colorado DA you committed a crime. He'll fly you in first class. Shrimp -- whatever you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a survey by AAA, 29.6 million people will be traveling over the Labor Day weekend, and those are just illegal immigrants coming across the border. It's not even counting people visiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some good news. The price of gasoline continues to fall. It has dropped 15 cents over the last two weeks. In fact, listen to this. Gas prices have dropped so much Dick Cheney was put on suicide watch. Can't take it anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton said today that she hopes America is ready for a woman in the Oval Office. See, that was the great thing about her husband Bill. He was always ready for a woman in the Oval Office. Anytime. Anyplace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a reporter in Duluth, Minnesota, found a dozen marijuana plants growing in a planter outside the police station. They're building a police station. Marijuana plants there. How many donuts are those cops eating?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, McDonald's is in the news this week. A health group criticized McDonald's new Crispy Bacon Ranch Salad for having more fat than the Big Mac. The salad has 51 grams of fat. The Big Mac only has 34. But see, that's the whole point. Now, McDonald's can say, they have a Big Mac, it's healthier than a salad. These people are not dumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest health report, what do you think the fattest state in the union is? What do you think it is? Mississippi. Fattest state in the union. In fact, you know what the state bird is? The fried chicken. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In science news, as you may have heard, Pluto is no longer a planet. Yeah, too small. In fact, it is so small it's now been downgraded to an NBC affiliate. That's how bad it is. Not even a planet anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this? Last night, at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, former Vice President Al Gore lectured the audience about global warming. The rock and roll audience, they cheered, gave him a standing ovation, then they got in their stretch limos, went to the airport, got in their private jets, flew home to Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Next week, Katie Couric begins as the anchor of the 'CBS Evening News.' Katie is the first solo female anchor -- pretty good. Wait a minute, if you don't count the two years Tom Brokaw worked in a skirt and heels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda has released another video -- this is rather strange. It features a 28-year-old American named Adam Pearlman from Orange County, California, who is in al Qaeda. How crazy is that? Finally an American takes a job away from somebody overseas, and it's in al Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy's wearing a white robe and a white turban, and he's demanding that all Americans convert to Islam. See, that shows how backwards al Qaeda is right there. I mean, who wears white after Labor Day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news today on the war on terror. We have captured al Qaeda's number two man -- for the 47th time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, our systems are so different. Over there, al Qaeda's number two man is always getting captured or shot. Here our number two man is the guy that does the shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some health experts are now warning obesity is becoming a bigger problem than global warming. Isn't that amazing? Al Gore solving one problem, causing another at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The film 'Crank' was number two at the box office this past weekend. It's about a hit man who's injected with a chemical that will kill him if his heart rate drops below a certain level. He has to constantly keep his adrenaline up to stay alive. Why are we wasting this stuff on hit men? Give it to the people at FEMA. That'll get them off their ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech earlier today, just a few hours ago, President Bush proclaimed that the United States is safer, but still not safe enough. President Bush said he will not rest until America has achieved total safetyocity.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico's top court proclaimed Philippe Calderon is the new president-elect. Isn't that nice? Yeah, court officials contacted Calderon this morning in his home in Phoenix, Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a new oil field was discovered under the Gulf of Mexico that could boost the US' gas and oil reserves by 50%. Yeah, finally, some good news for the oil companies, huh? About time those guys caught a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Did you see this little traitor on the news, this little weasel? I mean, one minute you're at the mall in Irvine as the assistant manager at the Cinnabon. The next minute, whoo, an international terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell from the video he's from Orange County. Did you know -- like instead of 'infidels,' he calls them 'infidudes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan has announced she's going to live in a tree house in Crawford, Texas. Live in a tree. You thought Bush liked to go to Crawford and clear brush and cut down trees before. Oh, boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Jackson said in an interview she's supporting Hillary Clinton for president, because she said it would show all those people who don't trust a woman in the White House. But you know, to be fair, when Hillary lived there, she didn't trust women in the white house, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that in England, Tony Blair will leave as British Prime Minister in May, stepping down in May. So President Bush has toppled yet another government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the gulf of Mexico, 270 miles southwest of New Orleans, drillers have discovered what they said could be the largest oil reserve ever. They said once the oil is drilled, it could boost our oil reserves by 50%. They said it would supply us with nearly 15 billion barrels of oil. In fact, the oil companies said this could cut the price of gas by almost a penny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when President Bush heard about this discovery, he ordered the invasion of Louisiana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that British Prime Minister Tony Blair is going to be stepping down next summer. He's going to be stepping down, yeah, stepping down. After hearing about it, President Bush said, 'Damn, he's the only foreign guy who speaks American.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says that Singer Clay Aiken, you know from American Idol, Clay Aiken will soon be named to the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview on Nightline the other night, Hillary Clinton says that she has to face what she calls 'the Goldilocks Theory of Politics,' where she's too liberal for some, too moderate for others, and never just right. Interesting. See, if anybody can identify with the Goldilocks story, it's Hillary Clinton. I mean, how many times has she come home found someone sleeping in her bed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the shuttle launch was delayed again today. They delayed the shuttle again today. ABC now doing a miniseries blaming the whole thing on Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic leaders in the US Senate have sent a letter to ABC asking them to cancel this big 9/11 docudrama they have coming this weekend. They call it 'inaccurate, partisan, and right-wing propaganda.' Or as Fox calls, it 'news.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the movie they claim that while he was President, Bill Clinton couldn't concentrate on fighting al Qaeda because the Monica Lewinsky scandal was such a huge distraction.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the Bush Administration has declared war on obesity. Got this story? In fact, today they just issued this deck of playing cards of the 50 most wanted.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the folks at ABC ran into some trouble with their 9/11 miniseries. You heard about this. A lot of politicians are upset about the show, because they say it cleverly mixes facts with lies to mislead the American public, which...you'd think politicians would admire that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton very upset about the way the 9/11 series portrayed him. He was furious. He wanted the movie pulled and replaced with a five-hour 'Girls Gone Wild' special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this 9/11 docudrama, it ended tonight, they said when Bill Clinton was President, he couldn't concentrate on fighting al Qaeda, because the Monica Lewinsky scandal was such a huge distraction. I mean, he would hold regular meetings with his advisors, but there was always that elephant in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big 6.0 earthquake in Mexico over the weekend. 6.0. It was so bad, even people who wanted to stay in Mexico were thrown across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The new president of Mexico, Felipe Calderon, says he will try to work out a deal with America that will allow millions of Mexicans to work in the United States. Great. I guess it's asking too much of the Mexican president to try and find new jobs in Mexico!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, that was -- I believe that was his campaign slogan. 'Mexico. Love it -- and leave it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey by Fox News, the two top Democrats in the presidential race are Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. Yeah, yeah. One is worried about the icebergs melting, the other is an iceberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore made a big announcement over the weekend. He said he hasn't ruled out running for president. He might do it one more time. He might try it one last time. And Tipper finally said, 'Honey, just pay the pizza boy and let him go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the heaviest person in the world is a man in Mexico who weighs over 1,200 pounds! 1,200 pounds. In fact, he said he once tried to cross the border but was stopped by authorities in California, Arizona and Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

A guy flying a commercial airliner in the United States, gets up to go to the back to use the bathroom, the lavatory on the airplane and somehow while he is out he locks himself out of the cockpit. So now they are like 40,000 feet in the air and the guy can't get back into the cockpit. Thank God the plane was landed safely by a snake but if it hadn't have been for that...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody watch the '9/11' movie? I don't want to say the casting was bad, but it didn't seem accurate. Like former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was played by Abe Vigoda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton is still very upset that ABC did not pull the movie. He wanted the movie pulled. If fact, he told them that he was thinking about changing his mind about appearing op the show 'Wife Swap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Senate Intelligence Committee -- that almost sounds like an oxymoron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They released a report this week saying there is no evidence of a relationship with al Qaeda. Well, thank God we found that out before we did something crazy!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In defending his hard-line stance against the war on terror, Vice President Dick Cheney said on 'Meet the Press,' Sunday, that part of his job is to think the unthinkable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore says he has not ruled out another run for the Oval Office. Have you seen Al lately? He is oval.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in the polling place today. Honest to God I see a guy stick his head out of the curtains. He's holding a pair of pants and he says, 'Can I get these in a 46?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Germany broke the record for unhooking brassieres. We've all been there, haven't we? 56 in 60 seconds. ... The old record, I believe, was held by a former president. I don't know for sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Late last night, during his live speech, President Bush spoke directly to Osama bin Laden and said, 'No matter how long it takes, America will find you.' Yeah. Then the President uncovered his eyes and said, 'Ready or not, here I come.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to the nation this week, President Bush stated we have to fight against people who reject tolerance and despise dissent. And anyone who disagrees with that is a traitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said -- this was a big thing in his speech. He said, he's often asked, 'Why are we in Iraq, when Saddam Hussein wasn't responsible for 9/11?' And Bush said his response is always the same. 'Dad, quit asking me that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore says he hasn't ruled out a second run for the presidency. Have you seen, Al, lately? He also hasn't ruled out seconds for pie, mashed potatoes, pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Democratic primary was here yesterday, and Hillary Clinton won easily, won the big primary last night, and there was a huge victory party after the primary results were announced.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Condoleezza Rice is dating a high-level Canadian diplomat. Yeah, sources say you can tell, 'cause Rice has an extra bounce in her step and is giggling a lot as she prepares for the invasion of Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Colin Powell shocked a lot people in Washington by speaking out against President Bush's policies, saying that the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. This is what I think he said. It was hard to hear him as he was being hustled out of the room and dragged to his new cell in Guantanamo Bay.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Congress voted to build a 700-mile fence along our 2,000 mile border with Mexico. We're building a 700-mile fence to protect our 2,000 mile border. Next up, we're gonna fund a trip halfway to the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Rice is being linked to Canada's foreign minister, Peter McKay. It's got to be awkward dating a fellow diplomat. Don't you think? Like today, McKay had to promise Condi he would get permission from the UN before he invaded her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I heard that she was trying to learn the Canadian national anthem. They were alone in a room and she was heard going, 'Oh, Canada! Oh, oh, Canada!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge protests in the Muslim world today. Hey, there's a surprise. No, no, over anti-Muslim comments made by the new Pope, Pope Benedict. And today, the Pope apologized, saying he never should have gone drinking with Mel Gibson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, happy birthday to Fay Ray, wonderful actress, Fay Ray. She was, of course, in the movie King Kong. And she would have been 99 years old today, and she was famous because her love interest with a giant ape, and...no, wait a minute. That's Marie Shriver. That's a whole different...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to build a 700-mile fence along the Mexican border. Yeah. Apparently, the idea is to keep Mexicans from getting back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush -- he's said a lot of things, but he said he has no plans -- I repeat, no plans to invade North Korea. No plans, yeah. Bush said, 'This time, Rumsfeld and I are gonna wing it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woo! 100-degree day in Los Angeles. Huh? I tell ya, I was sweating like the Pope visiting Mecca.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now, Muslims are furious with the Pope. And this stunned President Bush. He said, 'But I had no idea the Pope was Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Iraq has demanded that Pope Benedict issue an apology for statements he made, linking Islam to violence. Where did the Pope get that crazy idea, huh? I'm stunned!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the Pope says those weren't his views or his words. He said he was just quoting a 14th century Byzantine emperor. And today, Mel Gibson said, 'Yeah, me, too! That's what I was saying!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. When is the Pope going to apologize for Notre Dame's lousy performance on Saturday against Michigan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was nice. Today, the Pope got a nice 'pick-me-up' bouquet from Salman Rushdie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for President Bush. His approval ratings are up. Bad news, he's still not as popular as a bag of spinach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA is telling Americans not to eat spinach because it could be tainted with the E. Coli bacteria. Authorities estimate this ban could affect as many as six Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda leaders have announced they are joining forces with an insurgent group in Algeria to fight the French, which -- here's my question. How lame is this group in Algeria, they need help fighting the French?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Hezbollah says he is throwing a victory parade to honor his victory over Israel. Victory over Israel. Isn't that a little bit premature? That's kind of like the Eagles celebrating the victory over the Giants after the third quarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there is a rumor in Washington, that Condoleezza Rice has a new boyfriend. Woo! Allegedly, he's Canada's foreign minister, Peter MacKay. ... Since he's a diplomat and he visits her at the White House, he has to be given a Secret Service code name. And do you know what his Secret Service code name is? 'Captain Kirk.' Do you know why they're calling him that? Because he's going where no man has ever gone before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bounty hunter Duane 'Dog' Chapman -- did you hear about this? Arrested by US Marshals in Hawaii, now faces extradition to Mexico. Remember, he brought back that convicted rapist, that Luster guy, Andrew Luster? Brought him back here. Well now, they said he illegally brought to the United States from Mexico. Yeah, I suppose the legal way, most people in Mexico get here, normally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That hurricane in Mexico! Oh, those huge winds! You see the winds? It was so bad, illegal immigrants are just opening their ponchos and hang gliding over the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Pope Benedict apologized to the Muslims. Yeah. Altar boys on the other hand are still waiting for their apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow President Bush will be in town. He's going to be at the UN, the United Nations, and he will try to rally support for his plan to reunite Bobby and Whitney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dozens of world leaders are in town at the United Nations today. That's right. Yes, incredible. France sent President Jacques Chirac. Canada sent Prime Minister Stephen Harper. And Mexico sent the five guys who aren't already here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in town, as well. Earlier today -- true story -- at the main branch of the New York public library, President Bush and the First Lady gave a speech on literacy. That's right. Yeah. Apparently, she was for it and he was against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news -- unemployment continues to fall. In fact, the only person who lost his job recently, the Pope's speech writer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, is it me, or are these Islamist fundamental guys a little touchy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muslims all over the world are rioting because they're upset with the Pope. And again, I don't think President Bush understands these issues. Like, today, he said, these Muslims, 'Why can't they ask themselves -- what would Jesus do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pope Benedict said he was sorry this weekend, for quoting a medieval text that criticized the Muslim religion. Caused huge uproar. The Muslims are still -- in fact, the Muslims said, today, they will not accept a real apology until the Pope goes on 'Oprah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only is the Pope apologizing for that, today, he apologized to all the people that had to sit behind him in the movie theater when he wears his big hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Hezbollah says he is throwing a victory party in honor of their victory over Israel. Well, that could be a lot of fun. A party thrown by Muslim extremists. 'Oh, who wants some more goat, huh? Woo! Hey, turn off the music. And no girls!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ESPN magazine said the NFL's most valuable franchise is the Washington Redskins, worth close to $1.5 billion. See, that's because in Washington, DC, it's extremely rare people put together a game plan, and then actually try to execute it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the New York Mets. They clinched the division last night. The first time in 18 years. They clinched the division. Everybody now, of course, you know, this is the way it works. Everybody has Mets' fever. Hillary Clinton was wearing her blue and orange pants suit earlier today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks have any trouble with traffic today? Don't get me started on the traffic. It's because of the big opening of the UN, that General Assembly. You know who's here is the president of Iran, Ahmadinejad is here. Wait a minute. Are you laughing because that's his name or because I was able to get it out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, Ahmadinejad is here. He's the president who can actually pronounce nuclear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gridlock alert. I mean the city, it was incredible. This town today was just like Dick Cheney. You know what I mean? Every major artery was blocked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning in New York, President Bush gave a speech at the United Nations. Yeah, yeah, to help everyone understand, Bush's words were simultaneously translated into French, German and English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll, President Bush's approval rating has rebounded to 44%, the highest level in a year. He's up to 44%, yeah. Yeah, the White House says it's thrilled that Bush has gone from an overwhelming dislike to a general dislike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the president of Iran refused to attend a United Nations banquet because wine was being served. Yeah, the Iranian president said he was afraid he would get really drunk and say something pro-Semitic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating is rebounded to 44%. Well, unfortunately the 56% were at the UN yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez. You see this guy? He addressed the UN, attacked President Bush, screaming, 'Yankee imperialist, go home!' Hey, you're in New York, you moron. We're already home. You go home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, during his speech, Chavez called President Bush the devil, and then he thanks his new speechwriter, Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Iran also spoke at the UN. You could tell he also was trying to get under Bush's skin, too. Did you notice when he walked to the podium, he was whistling a Dixie Chicks tune?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush got back at him, you know? Since the President of Iran doesn't speak English, at the luncheon, Bush ordered for him and said, 'Bring him the spinach salad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, you know what most New Yorkers when they saw the President of Iran? 'Taxi!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you like me? We can make fun of President Bush. I don't like it when they make fun of President Bush. Like he's our guy, we can make fun of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While they were talking, President Bush actually put bumper stickers on all their cars. Can you read that says? 'While you're saying those nasty things about me, I'm invading your country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, President Bush said the United Nations is in danger of losing its credibility. And believe me, when it comes to international affairs, President Bush is an expert on losing credibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President also said he is that he is not waging a war against Islam. In fact, Bush said, 'I don't even know where Islam is. I can't find it anywhere. I'm looking at this map. I don't know where the hell it is.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was quite a day for President Bush in New York City. He visited the United Nations General Assembly and then he went to the New York Public Library. It was his sixth visit to the UN and his first visit, ever to a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, Muslims are very upset with the Pope after some anti-Muslim statements that he made. You can tell the Vatican is getting nervous, you know? Like today they issued a statement saying, 'The views of the Pope do not necessarily reflect the views of the Catholic Church and its subsidiaries.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the Pope has gotten so many threats now, they're now considering transferring him to another Parish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Pope might be getting worried. You see today, he led officials on a slow speed chase trough the Vatican City in the Popemobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush has been in town this week. He was over at the UN speaking at the General Assembly. He's also stopping by here for ventriloquist week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's exciting whenever President Bush is in town because for once, somebody in the city has lower approval ratings than me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the pressure of being the President is getting to George Bush. He addresses the UN General Assembly, and he tells them in this very impassioned speech he believes Iraq has spinach of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The audience was skeptical at the UN. Halfway through the speech, Pluto got up and left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad...is trying to win over the American people. Did you realize this? It is sort of a PR campaign. Earlier today, he was over at the UN, signing baseballs, 'I'm sorry I enriched uranium.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the President of Venezuela gave a speech, kind of a weird speech, at the United Nations. And he said the room still smelled from President Bush being there the day before. Yeah, President Bush responded by saying, 'Whoever smelt it dealt it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the President of Venezuela addressed the United Nations. He said maybe we need to move the UN out of the United States. We should move the UN out of the United States. Yeah, afterwards, a confused President Bush said, 'But then it would just be the 'Ited states.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, the President of Iran and the President of Venezuela all spoke at the United Nations, and they all made a point of not listening to each other's speeches.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Bush and the President of Iran tried to avoid each other all day. They actually had each other's people make sure they weren't in the same room together. You know, kind of the way the Clintons do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Venezuela called President Bush 'the devil,' yesterday. Yeah, his name is Hugo Chavez, or as Bush calls him -- the 'Fourth Dixie Chick.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Americans who don't even like President Bush, they're very upset over his remark. Even Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel from New York, he was furious that he insulted the President. In fact, when Dick Cheney heard, he said to Bush, 'You want me to take him hunting, boss?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, radical Muslims are still angry at the Pope. They said the Pope insulted a whole people and their religion. And then went back to calling for the destruction of Israel and killing everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, oil has fallen to $60 a barrel. Experts predict it will continue to fall until exactly one minute after the polls close, on November 7th.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks has announced, not happy with the 8,600 stores they have in the US. They now want increase that number to 20,000 stores. But, see, that's smart business planning. See, with Al Gore planning to run for president again, people are gonna need all the caffeine they can get to try to stay awake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ben &amp; Jerry announce the five finalists out of 40,000 entries, in 'Create a New Flavor' contest.

The worst flavor, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey's 'Nutty Buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The space shuttle has landed safely. Landed safely this morning. Yeah. It was touch-and-go for a while it was stuck in midtown traffic for two hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wacky dictator week this week at the UN. This Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, did you hear what he did at the general assembly? It was crazy, this guy was so out of control that he was invited to join the cast of 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Chavez is nuts, but he was a big hit. Honest to God, he starts off by calling George Bush devil and then he went right a run of 'yo mama' jokes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he calls Bush the devil, calls him the devil. Though it was unclear which one he was insulting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his controversial speech yesterday, the President of Venezuela said the room still smelled from President Bush being there the day before. Yeah, later, someone pointed out, that's just the wind from New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only that, during his speech yesterday, the president of Venezuela called President Bush the devil. ... Then today, he called him a cowboy. Yeah, President Bush was upset and said, 'He's making it really hard for me to choose my Halloween costume.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The space shuttle 'Atlantis' returned to earth yesterday. That was terrific, that was a good job, yeah. Actually, they got kind of a scare today. I remember seeing this on the news. One of the astronauts collapsed twice during a greeting. They think it could have been from 12 days in zero gravity -- or the alien inside her chest about to burst out!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say being in zero gravity for 12 days can make you lose all the strength in your legs. Were the Oakland Raiders in space recently?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has gone back home. Good news for President Bush. Now when somebody in New York calls him the devil, it's just Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of Hezbollah appeared in public today for the first time since the cease-fire with Israel. He told the Lebanese people, 'I feel your pain.' You know, that's Bill Clinton's line. You can't call us 'the Great Satan,' and then steal our president's lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then he went on to say, 'I did not have sexual relations with that goat.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one and number two best selling books on the Amazon list are attacks on President Bush, both books call him incompetent and a liar. I'll tell you something, if President Bush read books, he would be furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, the Pope signed 100 baseballs saying, 'I'm sorry for what I said about Muslims.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Pope said that he has a deep respect for Islam. Which on average means, 'Don't kill me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Pope has set a new record, most apologies for a guy that's not married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's as story. Sunday, the New Orleans Saints ill play their first home game since Hurricane Katrina in the Superdome against the Falcons. It will also be the first time in recent memory the people of New Orleans will be cheering someone named Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big movie opening this weekend, 'Jackass 2.' 'Jackass 2.' President Bush and Dick Cheney are both going to see 'Jackass 2.' Apparently thought it was a biography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they're going to go looking for some new legal methods of torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week -- this was a big announcement -- California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he will no longer drive a Hummer. He's driving a Hummer all these years. He's no longer gonna drive a Hummer. Yeah, Arnold said, 'I want to find a more environmentally friendly way to look like an a-hole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A French newspaper's reporting that Osama bin Laden has died. So I guess this past weekend really was a Jewish holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even officials of Saudi Arabia believe bin laden is dead. The reason they think he's dead is the checks they keep sending him keep coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton lost his temper in an interview with Chris Wallace on 'Fox News' when the subject of bin Laden came up. ... You know, I like Bill Clinton, but if he can't be pleasant and polite, I don't think he's going to be the kind of first lady Hillary's going to need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one had ever seen Clinton get that mad. Even Muslims were going, 'Take it easy, Bill! Calm down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton got right in Wallace's face. Although, it's not the first time Clinton made news for being in someone's face. So this is not unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Pakistan said on '60 Minutes' the other day the United States threatened to bomb his country back to the stone age if they did not help us in the war on terror. President Bush said he was not aware of the threat on Pakistan. In fact, Bush said until they showed him a map, he wasn't even aware of Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope met with Muslim leaders today at his summer home. Things were great until he showed them his collection of Danish cartoons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Transportation Security Administration has partially lifted the ban on carry-on liquids for air flights. They say you can bring liquids on...the plane as long as they are purchased from secure airport stores. Well, what a relief. Huh? See, now instead of bringing your own hair gel, you can buy a three-ounce tube at the airport for $162.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US News &amp; World Report cover story this week is about the fact in just four weeks -- in just a month -- the US population will hit 300 million people. The Census Bureau said it will happen October 27th depending on whether, you know, he's caught by the Border Patrol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big problems for California US Senate candidate Dick Mountjoy after he claimed he served on the battleship Missouri in Korea. ... Turns out he wasn't. No one on his ship can remember him being there. And believe me, when your name is Dick Mountjoy, people are going to remember you being there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if he wanted to exaggerate his military record, he should have said he was in the National Guard in Texas when Bush was there. 'Cause those people can't remember anything either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The small town of Greenleaf, Idaho, considering passing a new law -- you may have seen this on the news -- that would require every household in that town to have a gun. Everybody would have to have a gun in the house. Don't we have a place like that already? It's called Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you get to see 'Jackass 2?' Tremendous movie that opened over the weekend. Apparently, President Bush knew all about it but did nothing to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks get a chance to see former President Bill Clinton on the Fox News show on Sunday? He got very up set. He went ballistic. He was loud, he was angry and confrontational. So Fox gave him a show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger says will no longer drive a Hummer. He's giving it up for environmental reasons. And I was thinking about this. The last time a politician gave up hummers...&quot;</SPAN></P>

You can only carry them on if they were purchased at the airport gift shop. You know, who came up with this plan? The owners of the airport gift shops.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the rumors going around, the United States says they cannot confirm whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. Bin laden? We can't even confirm if Keith Richards is dead or alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton announced a new global initiative today, getting Fox News off the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Bill Clinton lost his cool, really went after the reporter, Chris Wallace. Oh, man. Really angry. People close to Clinton said they hadn't seen him this angry since Hillary made him take down his page on myspace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interviewer, Chris Wallace, he was really taken aback. He was stunned. You know, he talked about it afterwards. He said at one point, when Clinton lunged at him he felt like a mountain was coming down in front of him. Ironically, Clinton once experienced the same thing in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reverend Jerry Falwell, in the news again, has caused yet another controversy when he compared Hillary Clinton to the devil. Yeah. But today he said he didn't mean anything bad by it. He was just quoting a 14th Century Byzantine emperor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Italy, Pope Benedict held a meeting with Muslim diplomats. The meeting was called successful by the Vatican because, well, the Pope is still alive. So, successful meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The President of Afghanistan says that over the past year democracy has suffered a setback in his country. On the bright side, he now and President Bush have something in common. They can sit down and commiserate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nine Iranian weightlifters have failed drug tests and will not be allowed to compete in the world weightlifting championships. They had to return to Iran, go back to the old job of stirring giant vats of uranium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news, price of oil has dropped below $60 a barrel. ... Economists have now downgraded the oil companies profits from 'obscene' to just 'merely indecent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top grossing movie this week, 'Jackass Two.' Hey, now, don't confuse that with 'Jackass One,' that's Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the New Orleans saints. They beat the Atlanta Falcons 23-4 last night. Very inspiring. Did you see the Falcons defense? Oh, my God. The levees did a better job in New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the Saints' first time to the Superdome since Hurricane Katrina. Yeah. Which is pretty impressive considering FEMA still hasn't made it to the Superdome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, they said Osama bin Laden was dead, died of typhoid fever. No, he's not dead, so hold your applause. He's not dead. But this is good. This gives George Bush another chance not to kill him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the Saddam Hussein trial over there in Baghdad? That guy is a nut case. For the second day in a row he was tossed out of his own trial. Tossed out of his own trial. If he keeps this up he won't be allowed to attend his own execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a report right now, out of France, that Osama bin Laden is either dead or dying -- of dysentery caused by E. coli. ... We tried tanks and bombs and guns, but all it took was spinach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is gonna spend most of October going from city to city, fundraising. That's the plan. Yeah, then Bush will spend the last day of October traveling from house to house, trick-or-treating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls in California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is favored to win a second term. Yeah, yeah. Or, as Arnold calls it, 'The Sequel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave his final speech to the Labor Party. And he said -- this is a quote. 'It's hard to let go, but it's right to let go.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, these politicians.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Senate has voted to approve the building of a 700 mile fence along our 2,000 mile border with Mexico. 700 mile fence -- 2,000 mile border. This is what happens when you let President Bush do the math, okay?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey! If bin Laden had gained 200 pounds and put on a beret, Clinton would have nailed him like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a feud between Hillary Clinton, Senator from New York, and Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State.

Clinton claims in the late '90s, he came this close to killing bin Laden. In fact, almost as close as Hillary came to killing him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Saudi Arabia announced today plans to build a fence along its border to keep out immigrants. President Bush heard about it. He said, 'What? They have a border with Mexico, too? I can't believe it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia wants to build a fence along its border with Iraq. That's when you know things are getting out of hand, okay, when even Saudi Arabia wants to build a fence to keep out Islamic extremists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the real reason why they're building it? They're concerned that Saudi Arabian terrorists could lose their jobs to foreign terrorists. Trying to protect the local industry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for Virginia Senator George Allen. As you know, he's been accused of making racially insensitive remarks. Yes. A number of classmates of Allen's have come forward and said he used the 'N' word quite a bit. That's what they said, yeah. But he says he doesn't remember that. You know the reason he doesn't remember it? Because he never said it to a black guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, George Allen's dad was a football coach -- coached the Rams and the Redskins. In fact, George Allen, right now, is coaching the white team on 'Survivor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has passed a law which will allow teachers to strip search students. Well, what could go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Bush heard that Starbucks was raising the prices, he said, 'This is why we have to start drilling for domestic coffee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nine Iranian weightlifters failed a drug test and will not be able to compete in the upcoming world weightlifting championships. You know what they call nine athletes in this country failing a drug test? You know? A Major League baseball team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush had dinner with the President of Pakistan and the President of Afghanistan. ... The President of Pakistan claimed Osama bin Laden is hiding in Afghanistan. The President of Afghanistan said Osama's in Pakistan. And President Bush said, 'I like sprinkles on my ice cream.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reports that there's a car shortage in Cuba. And as a result, many Cubans are still riding in horse-drawn buggies. Yeah, the Cubans say the hardest part is teaching the horse to swim to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he is inviting other countries to help in Iraq. That's like inviting people to help you move. 'Iraq? I'm busy Wednesday, yeah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with Mike Wallace about his new book, legendary Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward said that Henry Kissinger is advising President Bush on Iraq and they're trying to fight the Vietnam War all over again. Hey, why not? Bush missed it the first time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Henry Kissinger? Is that best choice? How about taking advice from somebody who helped direct a war we actually won?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new leader of al Qaeda released an audiotape claiming that 4,000 al Qaeda members have been killed by US and Iraqi forces. In fact, so many al Qaeda guys are getting killed, they're running out of virgins for the afterlife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to Osama bin Laden, President Bush said this week, he has no time for finger pointing. He said he is the President of the United States, and he has important duties as leader of the free world. Then he put on his helmet and went to ride his bicycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Senate has voted to approve the building of a 700- mile fence along our 2,000-mile border. And our latest story, the Department of Transportation approved the building, today, of a 30-mile bridge from California to Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A reporter said today, in news, he overheard John Kerry saying that he's pretty much feeling what you need to feel to run for president. You know, John, if you just lie down for a while, I think that feeling will pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Mark Foley, cracking down on child predators. He's resigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it happened again. A congressman from Florida, 52-year-old Mark Foley, resigned today because of questionable e-mails he wrote to a former male page. The page was 16 years old at the time. Yeah. And out of force of habit, the Catholic Church offered to move him to another parish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, something, I don't think this Mark Foley guy gets it. Like, a reporter asked him what he's going to do after he resigns, he said 'I'm going to Disneyland.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today, he got a new job. He's going to join Governor Jim McGreevey's book tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Virginia Senator George Allen, who is under fire for making racially insensitive remarks, was at one point thinking about running for President of the United States. How about that? Forget about that. I guess they'll have to settle for imperial wizard now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what I love about politics -- this week, Allen introduced a bill to help black farmers. But he said this wasn't to make up for anything he said in the past. No, no, no. This is to make up for stuff he's going to say in the future.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore told the United Nations that cigarette smoking is a significant contributor to global warming. Well, to be fair, you have to blame us for that, the nonsmokers. We're the ones that made them go outside, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill O'Reilly says his name is on the al Qaeda death list. Yeah. I knew it was on the Al Franken death list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Rolling Stones are going to perform for Bill Clinton's upcoming 60th birthday party. See, that's one way to feel good about turning 60, bring in a band that's even older than you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Republican congressman from South Florida resigned after e-mails surfaced that suggests he's been making sexual advances to a male teenaged assistant. Yeah, his constituents in south Florida were shocked, and said, 'What's a teenager?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in an effort to ease tensions with Islamic groups, Pope Benedict made a speech urging tolerance. I don't think it helped. I don't think it helped. 'Cause what the Pope said was, 'Everyone should try to get along with these heathens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Oprah Winfrey says that she wants Senator Barack Obama to be the next president. Yeah, when Oprah heard that Obama doesn't want to be president, she parted the clouds and said, 'Oprah has spoken!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if you're into politics, what a big weekend this was. You could have seen Pakistan's President Musharraf on 'Meet the Press,' Senator Joe Biden on 'Face the Nation,' and Congressman Mark Foley on 'Dateline: To Catch a Predator.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida Congressman Mark Foley has resigned over allegations he sent explicit e-mails to underage boys. What is it with congressmen? If they're not grabbing your wallet, they're grabbing your ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let that be a lesson to anybody running for public office. You can Foley some of the people some of the time...but you can't Foley all of the people all of the time, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This incident is changing the way big companies do business in Washington. Like, tobacco companies now hiring underage boys as lobbyists because they know that's the best way it reach congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I just hope when this scandal ends, people don't suddenly start thinking the internet is some unsafe place for kids to hang out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Foley gets it. Like today he apologized and promised to turn over a new page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another videotape has been released on al Jazeera calling President Bush a failure and a liar. No, I'm sorry. That's Bob Woodward's book. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this? Author Bob Woodward has written a third book about President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq. The first two books said that Bush was firmly in command of a well-run team. But the third book says, no there's a lot of confusion and disagreement and bickering. Here's my question - shouldn't we be able to get our money on the first two books?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top White House aide Dan Bartlett has criticized Woodward's book saying that Woodward's already formulated conclusions before he even started interviewing people. That's what he said, Woodward had his mind made up before he even started. Well, if that's true, that would be wrong. That'd be like invading a country before you had all the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army is now investigating -- I love this story -- whether women in a Kentucky National Guard unit, who are now in Iraq, posed for naked photos with their M-16 and American decal flag decals covering their breasts. Military officials say if these pictures are found, that it is true and they did pose naked, the pictures will immediately be sent to recruitment centers nationwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore spoke to the UN last week about global warming. Former Vice President Gore said that cigarette smoking is a major factor in global warming. Though unfortunately, as soon as Al Gore started speaking, most of them went outside for a smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the United Nations, amphetamine use in Asia has become epidemic and it's getting worse. Boy, you thought we had a hard time competing with China before? Now they're taking speed, how many sneakers are they gonna crank out an hour now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 14-year-old boy has run away from his home in Florida and gone to live with his mother in Cuba. He tried to report to immigration officials in Cuba but there aren't any. Nobody has ever tried to immigrate to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of bizarre, a 3-year-old boy logged on to a computer -- his parents weren't paying attention. Kid's hitting buttons on the computer, winds up buying a car on eBay. 3 years old. Gets even stranger. Later, the same 3-year-old kid was caught online, this time chatting with Florida Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Florida Congressman Mark Foley. Whoa! I have to tell you something, at least the Democrats wait until the interns are 18.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the Republicans my gosh, I mean, and they reacted quickly. Quickly they transferred Foley to a different parish, that's what they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard anything about this new Bob Woodward book? In the new book, he said the Bush Administration is in a state of denial, yup. And today the Bush Administration denied it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In Bob Woodward's New Book:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Bush financed the war by selling White House china on eBay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Instead of pursuing al Qaeda, CIA agents originally pursued Al Pacino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. President's military strategy based on reruns of 'F Troop.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Bush's plan: To fix this mess by the end of his third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Says both Bush and Clinton could have done more to prevent the new Kevin Costner film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Frequent use of the word 'Brangelina.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The nude fold-out of Donald Rumsfeld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Iraq insurgency began when local affiliates started broadcasting 'Yes, Dear.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Book chronicles Condoleezza's futile attempts to get laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Bush lost focus on Iraq because Congressman Mark Foley wouldn't stop sending him inappropriate e-mails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Mark Foley, who resigned last week after sending sexually suggestive e-mails to teenagers, has checked into alcohol rehab. When asked about it, Foley said, 'I have a problem with 18-year-old scotch and 16-year-old boys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Woodward has a new book, it just came out. It claims the Bush Administration has bungled the war in Iraq. Yeah, when reached for comment, President Bush said, 'Just one more reason to hate books.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House claims that President Bush is getting so many requests to campaign with other Republicans, that he's running out of time. Yeah, not surprisingly, the requests are all coming from Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the number one movie this week is 'Open Season,' about young male pages working for Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Father Foley -- Congressman Foley. I'm sorry, Congressman Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After being caught sending explicit e-mails to underage boys, Florida Congressman Mark Foley has resigned. So, his seat is up for grabs, which is what got him in trouble in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is like the worst thing to happen to congressional Republicans since last Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people think GOP stands for 'Gay Old Pedophile,' pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the Republicans still don't get it. Since Foley's off the ticket, you see who they got to run in his place? I got one the campaign signs. This is who's running in Florida. You see, it's John Mark Karr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is my favorite part. Mark Foley has now checked into rehab for alcoholism. Oh, shut up! Oh, like that's the big problem. Who cares if he's addicted to Jack Daniels? He's addicted to little Jack and little Daniel. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This scandal with Foley has finally led to bipartisan cooperation in Congress. For example, Republican leaders had to meet with Ted Kennedy to find out what's the best rehab center.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Foley, they asked him if he wanted to enter Betty Ford. He went, 'Eww, she's a girl!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how long Foley will be in rehab, but I'm pretty sure they don't want him home answering the door on Halloween. That's probably not a good idea, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC is reporting that Mark Foley interrupted a vote on the House floor, stopped the House floor vote, so he could have online phone sex with a 16-year-old student. Say what you want with Bill Clinton, he could sit at a desk and have sex and work at the same time!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Woodward has a new book out claiming the Bush Administration is concealing that things are going badly in Iraq. Let me tell you something, if Bush is doing a poor job in Iraq, he's going to do even a worse job concealing the fact that he's doing a poor job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI now has reason to believe that the Mob and al Qaeda may be doing business with one another. In fact they have spotted Sammy 'The Bull' meeting with Ahmed 'The Goat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an exciting night to be here. The entire balcony tonight is filled with creepy congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a day here in New York City. Was it tremendous? A beautiful day. Lovely. All up and down the East Coast it was a beautiful day, although Condoleezza Rice does not recall enjoying it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day it was though. So nice a day that ex-Congressman Mark Foley was sending inappropriate emails to Al Roker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following that scandal in Washington with ex-Congressman Mark Foley? Well, you know, a couple of days ago he checked himself into rehab. Checked himself into rehab. It's gotten so bad he had to develop a drinking problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the ex-Congressman is nothing if not contrite. He says when gets out of rehab he wants to make a fresh start and turn over a new page, and I said to myself....that's what got him there in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, new evidence that just came out shows that former Congressman Mark Foley once engaged in Internet sex with a former page while a vote was being taken in the House. Yeah, during a vote in the House, he was doing this, which is amazing. Apparently, instead of voting 'Aye,' he voted, 'Oh, God, yes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush is on a trip to California. But he and Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger went out of their way to avoid each other. Yeah. Experts say this is bad news for the Republican Party, but great news for the English language.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today of course is Wednesday, or as Florida Congressman Mark Foley calls it, 'cyber hump day,' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, Florida Congressman Mark Foley has entered rehab. The bad news, 'Rehab' is a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, today they released more of Foley's e-mails. Or in his case, 'E-e-e-mails!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark Foley has outed himself. He has officially come out as gay. And today, gays told him, 'Go back in, we don't want you on our team either. Okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course the only one surprised that he was gay, Dennis Hastert. He's the only one that had no idea really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 'Rush Limbaugh' yesterday, the Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert said, &quot;We took care of Mr. Foley, we found out about it and asked him to resign.' Yeah, a year later. You know, that's not just slow, that's FEMA slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foley's attorney now blaming the whole thing on alcohol. On alcohol, yeah. Apparently he wasn't too drunk to type in the correct e-mail address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Foley says -- and this is my favorite part -- now he says he doesn't blame his behavior on the fact that he was molested as a teenage boy by a clergyman. Then why bring it up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big question now is what should be done with Mark Foley's seat in Congress. I say spray it with Lysol, boil it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been so many sex scandals with pages and interns. You know what we should do, replace the Sergeant at Arms in Capitol Hill. You know that guy? Get rid of him, bring in a mother superior, have her walk around with a ruler, just whack these Congressmen ? 'Get your mind out of the gutter!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean officials announce they will conduct their first-ever nuclear test. They say if this is successful, they will then attempt something even harder -- giving their people indoor plumbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressmen are now on their five-week -- they get five weeks off now, the Congressmen. ... And once again they're traveling the country, you know, talking to Americans about the most dangerous threats to our country -- flag burning and gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Nationals fired manager Frank Robinson after three last place finishes in a row. Three in a row. In fact, the only one in Washington with the worst record still keeping his job, Donald Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wildlife officials were called to a community in Boulder, Colorado, when a drunken bear was spotted stumbling around near a school. Did you see this? The bear became intoxicated from eating fermented apples. They shot the bear with a tranquilizer and carried him back in the woods to sleep it off. Same thing they do with Ted Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's interesting news from Baghdad. Authorities have imposed a nighttime curfew in Baghdad. ... This is a great idea, because if there's anything terrorists respect, it's a curfew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the big fall television season, and earlier tonight ABC premiered its current new episode of 'Lost,' the big 'Lost' show. It's all about the Republicans' election chances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS also has a brand new hit show. It's called 'Survivor: Congress.' Last week, Mark Foley was voted off. Next week, Dennis Hastert is being voted off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is reporting that former Congressman Mark Foley's instant messages were not only sexually inappropriate, but also full of typos. ... Yeah. In his own defense, Foley said, 'It's hard to type with one hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the season premiere of 'Lost.' In this episode...Democrats find themselves inhabiting a bizarre, unfamiliar place -- the moral high ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on with the Foley scandal in Washington. Or as they're now calling it, 'Tailgate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a month this has been for Republicans, huh? I mean, George Allen's been on the front page. And Mark Foley's been on every other page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congressman Foley has resigned because of e-mails he sent to underage boys. He said it was a difficult decision to resign because he has a lot of fondling memories of Capitol Hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the good old days, the only people Republicans were screwing were the poor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Speaker Dennis Hastert is under fire, because he claimed if he was told about Foley's sex scandal a few years ago, he doesn't remember it. Really? Well, here is my question. How bad is the rest of the Republicans' behavior, when news of one having cybersex with teenage boys isn't that memorable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington is so sleazy now, teachers are now warning children, a couple of books have just come out for young people. This is 'Jack and Jill Don't Go Up Capitol Hill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one of the e-mail messages, Foley told one of his young pages -- this is the actual quote. ... He said he is never too busy to masturbate. Well, that'll look good on a coin one day, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if only Bill Clinton had followed that advice, he could have stayed out of trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier in the week, Foley checked himself into rehab. According to the New York Times, many people questioned his alcoholism claim. That's when you know things are bad in Washington. When a Congressman can't even be trusted to be a drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Ted Kennedy finally spoke out. He said, &quot;Take it from me, alcohol does not make you go after young boys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ex-congressman Foley now, is making steady progress dealing with the drinking problem he's had since Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks read the new Bob Woodward book 'State of Denial?' It's a big, big book, 600 pages, a huge book. I believe that actually is a Mark Foley fantasy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House Speaker Dennis Hastert now knew about this Foley problem, the inappropriate e-mails, knew about the Foley problem three years ago and did nothing about it. Three years ago he knew about it and did nothing. I'm telling you, Congress makes FEMA look like FedEx, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in Washington, DC, President Bush attended the sixth annual national book festival. Yeah. President Bush began his speech by saying, 'It's great to be here to celebrate the sixth anniversary of books.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says that, so far, this has been his most bipartisan year yet. Yeah. Arnold said, 'This year, my speeches confused both Democrats and Republicans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For all the folks watching at home, interesting audience tonight, interesting fact. These are the only people left in America not currently in rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know this week, the Dow Jones hit a new high and Congress hit a new low, so that's kind of interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Mark Foley e-mail thing, this scandal, quite a huge conflict within the two wings of the Republican Party. It seems the financially corrupt are now fighting with the sexually corrupt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress now already taking measures to reduce the number of incidents between congressmen and pages. For example, from now on congressmen will no longer be able to hand pick their pages from Myspace.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, last night I saw 'Two and a Half Men.' House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Did you see him on the news?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Hastert defended himself by saying he had no idea what was going on. Hey, don't laugh, worked with President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to imply Hastert was slow to react, but earlier today he says now he's going to start looking into that Richard Nixon Watergate thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI has yet to conduct any physical searches of Congressman Foley's home or office. It's not that they can't. It's just, even the FBI doesn't want to touch anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today, they're now taking action against Foley, so he will no longer be able to e-mail. They're going to sign him up with AOL, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the last two years of the Clinton Presidency, we told what, like 9 million Monica Lewinski jokes. Now, here we are tonight talking about Republican congressman Mark Foley having cyber sex with young boys. So, for the record, forget Fox News, we're the fair and balanced network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Iraq today. See, that's when you know things are bad in Washington, when it's safer for Republicans to go to Baghdad, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore gave a speech on global warming at the United Nations last week. He spoke for three hours. Three hours of Al Gore speaking. But you know something? He really brought some of the countries together. In fact, halfway through the speech I saw the Iranian delegate fall asleep on the shoulder of the Israeli delegate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has signed into law a bill that calls for the building of a 700-mile fence along the US/Mexican border. You know who's excited about this fence? Graffiti artists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of Malaysia has announced they will start punishing citizens who do not properly speak the state language. In addition to billy clubs and guns police will now carry rulers and rap people on the knuckles if they don't speak the language correctly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope they don't do that in California, I don't speak any Spanish at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to new medical research, marijuana can actually help slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Isn't that ironic, a disease that causes you to forget things can be treated with a drug that causes you to forget things?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it is fall in New York City. Hillary Clinton was wearing her flannel pant suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush condemned Congressman Mark Foley. Called for a thorough probe of the congressional page scandal. Yeah. However, Foley says that a thorough probe is what got him in trouble in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans finally got some good news over the weekend. North Koreans set off a nuclear bomb. Thank God. It was so powerful, it knocked the Mark Foley story right off the front page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And knocked him off the page he was on, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, pretty big bomb. I understand Kim Jong-Il fell off his platform shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know a lot about North Korea's weapons programs. By the end of the year, they could have as many bombs as NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Countries all around the world are reacting to North Korea's nuclear test. The US condemned it, China said it was wrong. France surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you hate getting these spam e-mails in your computer? They are so rude! I get one today, it says huge erection. I think it's one of those things for Viagra. Apparently, it was from Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More details coming out about this Foley page scandal. Seems he once told a teenage page that 18 is the magic number. When do you turn 18? When the teen said in three years, Foley said, 'Close enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post says the voters may see the Mark Foley scandal as a metaphor for the Republicans' ethical lapses. Really? Like a metaphor? Like a congressman having sex for teenage boys is just a metaphor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Congress is considering getting rid of the congressional page program. Been there for 200 years. Now get rid of it. Don't get rid of congressmen preying on the kids. Get rid of the kids. They're a distraction. 'How can we work with all these little hotties running around here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the House, Dennis Hastert has been meeting with everyone in Washington to figure a way out of this. Not meeting with everyone. I think it's fair to say he's never met with Jenny Craig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the week, President Bush gave another speech, his leave no child behind speech. The children said, 'It's okay, leave us behind if you want, we will be all right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's approval rating is at an all-time low. North Korea is setting off bombs. Iraq is a mess. The Foley scandal keeps getting worse. Even the Democrats might not be able to blow this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, John Kerry says he is serious about running for president again. There you go. See? I think I speak for everyone when I say, 'John, we're just not that into you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former president Bill Clinton has now struck a deal with several major food companies to supply schools with food that have less fat, sugar and salt. Part of Clinton's program, 'No child left with a big behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this date in 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered America. And it turns out that the Republicans discovered it three years earlier but said nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This North Korean nuclear test, that gives me the willies. And President Bush says he's okay. He says the nuclear test is okay as long as they don't conduct a nucular test.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The North Koreans are starting to gloat a little bit. The test was a big success and to celebrate Kim Jong-Il is wearing his hair in the shape of a mushroom cloud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is very pleased with the nuclear test; it went so well next they are going to try indoor plumbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il defied the United States and tested a nuclear weapon. Yeah. ... President Bush very angry about this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Myspace.com said it is launching a voter registration page targeting young adults. A page just for young adults, yeah. Sadly, the only person the Myspace page has attracted so far is former Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sesame Street' announced they are coming out with a special version of the show for Afghanistan. There's going to be a 'Sesame Street' for Afghanistan. Yeah. Yeah, during the first episode, the Afghani muppets wage a jihad on Spongebob.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crazy week this has been. I don't know who Americans are more worried about being attacked by, terrorists in the Middle East, a dictator of North Korea, a Congressman from south Florida. It is unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now saying that Kim Jong-Il's bomb may have been a dud. ... They said, yeah, it might not have been an atomic bomb at all.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I'm not saying the North Koreans exaggerated the size of their bomb, but witnesses say the experimental blast involved a Mentos and a Coke bottle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that North Korea has defied the will of the international community. And believe me, when it comes to defying the will of the international community, President Bush knows what he's talking about on that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush said today we're still trying to confirm whether they set off a bomb or not. A bomb? We can't even confirm who the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby is!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Democrats attacked President Bush's North Korean policy. In response, Bush said, 'Gotcha! I don't have a North Korean policy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kim Jong-Il -- this is interesting -- he said after the test was conducted, he got an e-mail from Congressman Foley telling him he would 'love him long time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Foley, let's see what's happening on Brokeback -- Capitol Hill. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it used to be a good thing in Washington when two congressmen were on the same page. Now, it's a horrible thing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the LA Times said the former page has come forward and said he had sex with Congressman Foley. Yeah. That's not bad enough? When the kid went to confession after it happened -- got nailed by his priest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army has a new slogan. They're dropping 'An Army of One.' The new slogan is 'Army Strong.' That's the new slogan. &quot;Army Strong.' I think it's better than the other one they had. 'Did somebody say jihad?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Donald Rumsfeld is the one responsible for changing the slogan to 'Army Strong.' See, that's the words he uses when he briefs President Bush. That's how he explains things. 'Army strong.' 'Iraqi mad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI raided a call girl operation in Washington DC. Call girl operation in Washington DC. Well, finally a political scandal the entire family can enjoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Washington DC call girl operation was allegedly patronized by politicians. Politicians using the services. Instead of cash, one girl got a new dam in her home state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my gosh, what a beautiful day. 73 degrees. 30% chance of North Korean fallout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the crazy maniac, that Kim Jong Il. If you think he's bad, what about his brother, Mental Lee Il?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush seems to think we need more time to determine if the bomb any detonated was a nuclear strike. North Korea has now been condemned by 114 nations. 114 nations condemned their actions. Nothing like this has happened since I hosted the academy awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the guy? Have you seen this Kim Jong Il? I mean nice hair: I mean, what is he putting in his shampoo, viagra?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush helped dedicate an aircraft carrier named after his father. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Yeah, he christened the ship by saying, 'It's great to be here on the USS Dad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story yesterday, North Korea conducted a nuclear test, and the blast was so small, that many scientists are saying it was a dud. Yeah, apparently, the nuclear bomb didn't work well because it was made in Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army just announced that in order to help recruitment, they are raising the weight limit for female soldiers. Yeah. So they're -- they're also changing their slogan to 'The Army, now with more junk in the trunk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, President Bush said today, the US will not attack Korea, or North Korea. Oh, sure, we may liberate them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot more information coming out about this North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Il, apparently he has a tremendous ego, had three wives, and he's fanatical about his pompadour hairstyle. Kind of like a miniature Donald Trump, you might say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you heard his latest demand? You hear what he said today? Now he's demanding his old job back on 'Fantasy Island.' 'De plane, boss! De plane!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating is dipping into the 30s, while Mark Foley is dipping into the teens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More shocking news coming out about this Foley scandal. Every day it's something. It turns out, Foley once had phone sex while waiting to cast a vote in Congress. Imagine that, he's having sex on the phone while waiting to cast a vote. You know, it's another classic example in Washington, of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, of course, dozens of calls for House Speaker Dennis Hastert to step down. As you know, Hastert was a former gym teacher and a boys wrestling coach. To which Foley said, 'Why would anybody quit a dream job like that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico said today, it plans to take the dispute about building a fence along its border with the United States to the United Nations. The United Nations has traditionally been against building fences between countries. 'Cause as you know, the UN believes fences are for sitting on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Army has a new slogan. It's replacing its slogan, 'An Army of One,' with 'Army strong.' That's the new slogan. This slogan was developed by a major ad agency with a $200 million contract. They paid $200 million for 'Army Strong.' Sounds more like 'Army Screwed,' okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like that? Army strong? I mean, I knew we were lowering the academic requirements. I didn't realize we were wiping out the use of verbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks hear about the new scandal in Washington, DC? Police have broken up a call girl operation. And apparently it catered exclusively to politicians, politicians -- yup. And instead of cash, one girl actually got an interstate highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you have the willies about the nuclear testing in North Korea? Listen to this, there's nuclear testing in North Korea, war in Iraq, earthquake in Japan, president Bush keeps saying, 'Where is Superman?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that North Korea will face repercussions. That's what he said, President Bush said North Korea will face repercussions. You know he's serious when he takes the trouble to learn a new word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, at a press conference, President Bush said that he will not attack North Korea. President Bush said he will not attack North Korea. Well, of course not. They actually have weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a press conference this morning, President Bush said that he has no intention of attacking North Korea. Yeah. Then Bush said, 'However, I can't speak for Donald Rumsfeld.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources close to John Kerry say they think he's planning on running for president again in 2008. Yeah. Yeah, apparently Kerry's serious, because he's already practicing his concession speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just a few hours ago, the population of the United States has reached 300 million people. Yeah. This is either a tribute to a strong democracy or really weak Border Patrol.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The news is reporting that dictator Kim Jong-Il is ecstatic since setting off North Korea's first atomic bomb. They say he's walking around like he's 5 feet tall..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, he is a strange looking guy that Kim Jong-Il guy is. He's little. He's got the big pompadour. Looks like Wayne Newton and William Hung had a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't always believe the rhetoric coming out of North Korea. Like, you see what he said today? Kim Jong-Il declared that he was the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Florida Congressman Mark Foley, completed his first week in rehab. Yeah. He got a chip. Today he's gone seven days without a page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night we had Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the show. And some of his opponents were very upset he was booked on our show and they weren't, because of equal-time. But there is no equal-time rule. Actually, it's not the first time we had an equal-time problem. I remember, once we had President Bush on. Then we had to book Jessica Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I don't know if this is reassuring or not -- President Bush said he has no plans to attack North Dakota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did get some good news today that -- that thing in North Korea, that thing in North Korea, that was not a nuclear test. No, no, no. Turns out they were just blasting out the foundation for the world's largest nail salon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts are now saying North Korea may have enough material for six more bombs, six more bombs. And it's the same fear they have about Jessica Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a press conference yesterday, President Bush said that the United States has no plans to attack North Korea. Yeah. Yeah, the President said we can't invade North Korea -- they actually have weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A congressional candidate is very angry about how loose security is at the US/Mexico border, so to prove his point, yesterday, he snuck an elephant across the border. Yeah. Apparently the elephant likes it here and has already been hired to do yard work in Encino.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy Friday the 13th! It's Friday the 13th. Well, the Republicans aren't worried. They figure, hey, what else could go wrong, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the snowstorm? You see back East -- record snowstorms in October. Snow in Detroit, New York, two feet of snow in Buffalo. It was so deep Al Gore had to cancel his speech on global warming. That's how deep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story appears to be North Korea's nuclear bomb is not a nuclear bomb at all. Turns out the entire explosion was filmed by the producers of 'Jackass.' Did you know that? Johnny Knoxville strapped to the rocket at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you're learning more and more about the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il, according to his biography, they say he has constantly been accused of dishonesty, drunkenness and sexual excess. So if he lived here, he could be in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did a profile of him last night on the news. They said he's a huge fan of Hollywood movies, has like 20,000 movies. You know what his favorite film is? '101 Dalmatians,' or as they call that in North Korea, 'My Dinner With Andre.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what's that military outfit? That '70s bad Members Only leisure suit he wears. What is that all about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's got to be tough being him. I mean, he's a powerful leader. He allegedly has all these weapons at his disposal, yet every time he goes out to dinner, they got to bring the booster seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he is so little, Mark Foley accidentally sent him an inappropriate e-mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, Mark Foley has agreed to give his first interview since the scandal broke. The creepy part ? it's in 'Boy's Life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a $200 million ad campaign to come up with a new motto for the Army ? 'Army Strong.' That's the new slogan, $200 million to come up with that, $100 million a word. That's the most anyone's gotten for two words since Kevin Federline said, 'I do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, we're not the only country replacing our military slogan. A lot of other countries are now coming up with new slogans. For example, Ireland, their new slogan: 'Bar fight! Bar fight!' China: 'An army of one...billion!' Jamaica's new slogan: 'Sorry, mon, we can't remember our slogan.' France's new slogan: &quot;Making invading armies feel at home for over 100 years.' And Japan, their new slogan: 'Mess with us, we'll benihana your ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of this coming Thursday, Saddam Hussein will have been on trial for one year. One year. Do you realize if his trial was in LA, he'd be out playing golf by now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems grain stockpiles are at their lowest in 25 years. We are running short of grain. To give an idea how low grain supplies are, today Rice Krispies laid off Snap and Crackle. Pop is the only one working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big spinach E. coli outbreak -- you know about that. The big spinach E. coli outbreak now been linked to cow manure, cow manure. So the next time you're at a fancy restaurant, do not order the cow manure, whatever you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's being reported that prostitution has skyrocketed in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina. In fact, the hookers there are now offering what they call 'The FEMA Special.' Did you head about that? They tell you to go screw yourself. That's pretty much what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's Friday the 13th. Were you aware of that? Today's Friday the 13th, ladies and gentlemen. It's interesting. Down in Washington, a confused George W. Bush lit a menorah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this weekend is the annual cat show at Madison Square Garden.&quot; The &quot;cats are judged on poise, gait and bearing. Coincidentally, that is how Congressman Foley selects a page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we have an update on Congressman Foley now. In addition to his fake drinking problem, he has now developed a fake gambling problem. So he'll ? he'll be gone for quite some time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did you hear about this? The House Ethics Committee is going to look into Speaker Dennis Hastert. They're going to look into Speaker Dennis, the House Ethics Committee, in a big Mark Foley scandal. Wait a minute, there's a House Ethics Committee? No one told me about a House Ethics Committee. Why wasn't I notified?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the US Census Bureau, this week the population of the United States reached 300 million people, 300 million, yeah. Yeah. When they heard about it, China called and said, 'You're off to a great start.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News out of Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, soldiers say that enemy fighters are hiding out in forests of marijuana plants that are ten feet high. Hard to get at 'em, they're in forests of marijuana plants ten feet high. As a result, Snoop Dogg has volunteered to go in and smoke them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this last story is very strange. Scientists say they've proven that homosexuality is genetic after observing gay behavior in 1,500 species. Yeah. Not surprisingly, all 1,500 species claimed it only happened that one time at camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story, as you know, a strong 6.6 magnitude earthquake hit Hawaii yesterday morning. Pretty scary. Lots of injuries and damage. Luckily, no one was killed. ... And President Bush says he wants to do everything he can to help them, 'cause he considers Hawaii to be one of our strongest allies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, FEMA was there immediately. Actually, see, FEMA had arrived a day earlier to assess the damage from the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, most of our nation's cities would be unprepared to evacuate in the case of a major disaster. Washington, DC, received an 'F' as one of the hardest cities to get out of, unless, of course, you're a Republican in November, then it'll be real easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read in the paper today, there's a report that says that President Bush has no plan if Congress goes Democratic. Is that a surprise, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't have a plan for Iraq going democratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UN peacekeeping forces were dispatched over the weekend. Not to Iraq, to Florida, for the Miami/FSU game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to hurt Kim Jong-Il directly, the UN has imposed sanctions on North Korea. Banned the import of all luxury items, like cognac, liquor, French wine. If you want to hurt Kim Jong-Il directly, ban platform shoes, that's how you get him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see that guy that jumped the wall at White House over the weekend? Secret Service got a guy, he climbed the White House fence, got this close to the Oval Office. This close, but didn't get in. So he's obviously a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton came out in support of the estate tax last week. Clinton said that some people think he should leave all his money to his daughter when he's gone. But he doesn't think he should. He said he should spend it now, on other people's daughters, while he's still around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest poll about the 2008 election, many voters in Iowa consider Hillary Clinton to be their second or even third choice. Yeah. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'I feel the same way.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I guess at the United Nations, discussions this week were all about Kim Jong-Il. Or as they call it, small talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report by the world energy experts, North Korea is so short of electricity, the whole country is switched off at 9:00 at night. Did you know that? Electricity shut off at 9:00. So it's a country where few people speak English. They have power outages all the time. They're ruled by a funny-looking guy with a strange accent. It's like California without the traffic, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now concerned that North Korea is about to test a second nuclear bomb. And because of that, the UN passed this resolution. Take a look. 'You must be this tall to detonate the device.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is so angry at North Korea, he's told our celebrities not to adopt any children from that country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy tried to jump over the fence of the White House this past weekend. He was arrested by Secret Service. Secret Service was able to catch the guy, because once the guy got on the ground, he didn't know where to run, basically. So, we have two guys in the White House without an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan, they say the enemy is now hiding in ten-foot-high marijuana forests. They say the marijuana forests are so high and so thick, even vehicles cannot get through. Now I'm no strategist, but it seems to me if you put some bags of Doritos and Twinkies outside...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning announcement, Senator Hillary Clinton said that she supports legalizing the torture of a captured terror suspect to gain information. She's for legalizing torture -- which is really bad news for Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book, 'The Way to Win,' Democrats who support Hillary Clinton were worried about rumors that Bill has started to cheating again. It's in the book. So they sent someone to confront him about it. And Clinton said there was nothing to the rumors. And believe me, when Bill Clinton denies he's having an affair, you can take that statement to the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a big controversy up in San Francisco. The Mayor there, Gavin Newsome, is dating a 20-year-old blonde. And there's a picture of the two of them. And she has a glass of wine in her hand and she's only 20. I know what you're thinking. 'The Mayor of San Francisco is straight?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Director Tim Burton on tonight. He's here to talk about the re-release of his film, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas, or, as Republicans call that, 'election day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush invited several prominent Muslims to the White House for dinner to mark the end of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan. That's very nice. Yeah. Actually, the President thought he was inviting three Muslims, but he only invited Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the United States' population officially reached 300 million people. Yeah, after hearing about it, the President of Mexico said, 'Hey, we got plenty more where that came from.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the population of the United States passed 300 million today, employees at the Census Bureau celebrated with cake and punch. A spokesperson for the Census Bureau said, 'We work hard, but we play hard, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is now concern that North Korea is about to set off a second nuclear bomb. Experts say the second bomb is twice as powerful as the first one, which means it could blow up two mailboxes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As much as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il verbally attacks the US, they say he is addicted to American pop culture. He likes American movies, he likes American TV shows. And judging by the platform shoes and the Members Only leisure suit, his favorite show is 'That 70s Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say that for Republicans to win this November, they need something really, really big to happen. Like, if President Bush suddenly finds Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden. Hey, we can't even find Wesley Snipes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian government just announced that they are going to slow down Internet access speed, because they don't want Iranians to have good Internet service. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Senator John McCain is denying rumors that are floating around Washington that he recently went drinking with Hillary Clinton. Yeah, McCain's exact quote was, 'Five years with the Vietcong was enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart announced, this week, that they are expanding their operations in communist China. Yeah. When asked how it felt to work with an oppressive dictatorship that denies basic human rights, China said, 'Wal-Mart isn't that bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Homeland Security, there was apparently a threat by terrorists against NFL stadiums this weekend. Did you hear that story? Turns out the whole thing is a hoax. A huge hoax. Of course, it's a hoax. Even terrorists aren't going to sit through an Oakland Raiders game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says there are similarities between Iraq and Vietnam. Of course, the biggest difference is, his dad could get him out of Vietnam.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mark Foley scandal is causing repercussions all throughout Washington. In fact, today one senior law enforcement official said, they plan to start questioning the female pages, to which Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton said, 'This witch hunt has to stop right now! It's gone on long enough! We can't have this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Mark Foley said he was molested by a priest 38 years ago. Remember that? Well, now, the Catholic priest in the Foley scandal has come forward and admitted to actions that Foley might perceive as inappropriate. This is what he said. I'm not changing -- this is what he said. He said, like, when he gave the 14-year-old Foley a naked massage. Now, how could anyone perceive that as inappropriate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How warped is your mind, to take something as innocent as a naked priest giving a 14-year-old naked altar boy a massage, and turn it into something dirty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you believe how self-destructive Congress has become? You know this upcoming election, it's not an election, it's an intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting ruling. In Florida, an appeals court has ruled that women can attend political protests while topless. Thank you very much. Well, this should encourage a lot more guys to become politically active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think that's fair. Hey, if politicians can go to topless bars, topless women can go to political rallies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has overturned the conviction of Enron chairman Ken Lay, because he died before he could appeal his guilty conviction. Yeah. Which means people are going to have a tougher time getting their money back now from his estate because he's innocent. Boy, you can bet Ken's partying in hell tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that unbelievable? Even dead, this guy is still screwing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that? You can be declared innocent by reason of death in this country? That's probably not something you want to hear from your lawyer, huh? 'Bob, we have a strategy for getting you off. It's going to take real commitment on your part. But I think, by golly, we can do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids, there are rumors that Monica Lewinsky may have switched teams, after she was spotted being very chummy with a bisexual British actress.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Opponents say they're concerned that legalizing marijuana might attract the 'wrong element' to Nevada. Yeah, yeah. There'd be pot smokers coming to the state and bothering the hookers, alcoholics and degenerate gamblers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is getting rid of the phrase 'stay the course.' That was his phrase for like the entire war. Stay the course. I was thinking, 'Maybe the phrase should have been find bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Halloween tomorrow. That's of course when little kids come to your house looking for candy. Or as Congressman Mark Foley calls it, 'Speed Dating.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to scare Hillary Clinton tomorrow night? Here's what you do -- you knock on her door dressed as Barack Obama and yell, 'I'm running!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand President Bush has his costume all picked out. To scare people, he's gonna dress up as Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what Dick Cheney does on Halloween? I didn't know this. Did you know this? I guess when kids knock on his door, he waterboards them till they give up all their candy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the United States, we have Halloween, but in Mexico, they have Day of the Dead. Do you know what that is, Day of the Dead? You know what that is? That's when Mexico honors all the souls who have departed to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is 'doing what God tells him to do.' This is how we're able to win the war against those religious fanatics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report to Congress says that 14,000 US supplies, weapons, are reportedly missing in Iraq. 14,000 weapons are missing. Now, forget weapons of mass destruction, now we can't even find our own weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il called the UN resolution against him a declaration of war. You know, we got that embargo going, so it cuts off things like fresh lobster. He loves fresh lobster, so we cut that off, so he can't get fresh lobster. Let me tell you something. You know the best way to make sure Kim Jong-Il does not get fresh lobster? Give him one of those all-you-can-eat passes to the Red Lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada gubernatorial candidate Jim Gibbons has been accused of trying to fondle a single mom in a parking garage, after a night of heavy drinking. I love this story. Now, they're saying to win, he has to give the speech of his life. And that's just to Mrs. Gibbons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some sad news from the world of popular music. Snoop Dog has been arrested for drug possession. Yup, he says he's going to plead it. He's going to plead not gizzle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Fidel Castro appeared on television to prove that he's not dead. That is what I try to do every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is being criticized for campaigning only in areas that are friendly to him. That's what they're saying. Yeah. For example, this morning, he spent the day campaigning at Dick Cheney's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh recently upset a lot of people 'cause he accused Michael J. Fox of exaggerating his Parkinson's Disease symptoms for political reasons. Yeah. Then Limbaugh accused Stevie Wonder of exaggerating his blindness for free sunglasses!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in over a month, Fidel Castro appeared on Cuban television. That's right. Yeah. Cubans were excited to hear this and said, 'We have a television?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the British government hired Al Gore as a global warming advisor. Yeah. Gore says he's looking forward to being completely ignored in a new country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Halloween, &quot;I had a little boy show up dressed in bandages. I said, 'Oh, what are you supposed to be, the mummy?' He said, 'No, no, Dick Cheney's hunting buddy.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know one of the more popular costumes this year? A lot of kids are going out as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il. No, really. Because all of his clothes are already kid's size, so it's not a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, Halloween is the scariest day of the year, unless, of course, you're a Republican. Then it's next Tuesday. That would be the scariest day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking in a recent interview, Vice President Dick Cheney said he thinks Hillary Clinton has what it takes to be president. That's what Dick Cheney said. He thinks Hillary Clinton has what it takes to be president. Of course, he said the same thing about George Bush. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who is considering running for president in 2008, has attributed his past use of drugs to youthful confusion. He said, 'Teenage boys are frequently confused.' And when he heard that, Congressman Mark Foley said, 'Confused teenage boys? Where?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It said in the paper today that President Bush is now only campaigning in friendly territories. Friendly territories? Where would that be? Pretty much just around the ranch in Crawford? Is that about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe go down to the diner, as long as you don't go by Sheehan's place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush warned Democrats not to celebrate victory too early. Yeah. From the guy who put up the 'Mission Accomplished' sign three years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the Bush Administration is no longer using the phrase 'Stay the course' in Iraq. They've dropped that. They've dropped that. It is being replaced by a new phrase, 'Hey, looked good on paper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jeffrey Skilling, who just got sentenced to 24 years for the Enron scandal -- you know the guy I mean? Has a new book coming out. Here it is, right here. It's called 'The Smartest Guy In The Prison Shower.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was in the Halloween spirit. Earlier today, Hillary Clinton was wearing an orange and black pant suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also, of course, Halloween down in Washington, DC, and a confused George W. Bush celebrating Halloween, lit a menorah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, my doorbell rings. And I've got this kid standing there with his foot in his mouth. I said to the kid, 'Who are you supposed to be?' He said, 'John Kerry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry now getting slammed by the Republicans because of a botched joke he did about President Bush in Iraq in a recent speech. And, of course, Kerry's stunned by this. He said, 'What? People listen to my speeches? When did that happen?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as soon as it happened, you know, President Bush, oh, he demanded that Kerry apologize. Oh, yeah. You ever think you'd see that? Bush demanding an apology from someone for stumbling over their words?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry should have tried the Bush strategy. Say so many stupid things nobody cares anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today Kerry personally apologized to any service members who were offended by what he said. Kerry said he was drunk at the time and he was going to enter rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush accepted the apology, but half-heartedly. You know, he told Kerry, 'Now you should take off the Herman Munster mask, because Halloween is over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, you know, Kerry's off the campaign trail. In fact, several Democratic candidates have asked Kerry not to campaign with them. In fact, last night, his kids even said, 'Could you trick or treat with someone else?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have heard this, oil prices have now dropped below $58 a barrel. Which, if my math is correct, means the election less than a week away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fill your tank on Tuesday, because by Wednesday you're screwed for the next four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we turned the clocks back over the weekend, which was great news for Republicans. They got to stay in power for an extra hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This political race is really sleazy and dirty. Isn't it just the dirtiest, nastiest campaign? I tell you, that Congressman Mark Foley, he was smart. He got out just in time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Vice President Dick Cheney denied he endorsed water boarding to get terrorists to talk. He prefers to call it 'bobbing for the truth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney said, last night, on Fox News that in the past few weeks, Republican candidates are picking up speed. They're picking up speed. Yeah, that tends to happen when you're going downhill real fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Duncan Hunter of California announced this week he's going to run for president in 2008. As he announced that, political experts all across the country said the same thing. 'Who the hell is Duncan Hunter?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an indication that things aren't quite right in the world. A company is going to build a luxury hotel in the mountainous region of Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden used to have a hideout. It's a $10 million project. You are going to build a luxury resort hotel where Osama bin Laden is staying. How many times have you said to yourself if I could only vacation in a Taliban stronghold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this John Kerry controversy, ladies and gentlemen? Have you been following that? He is out there in California and he tells some kind of a joke and it backfires and he is walking around saying he botched a joke. He was trying to tell a joke about Bush. This guy can lose elections he's not even in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now to his credit John Kerry was very, very upset about the joke and the he apologized. He is still very, very upset. All day long he has been walking around with a long face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry's in trouble for making a joke about soldiers being uneducated. Yeah. As a result, Kerry promised to stop making jokes and stick to boring people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Duncan Hunter announced he's thinking about running for president in 2008, and he's put together an exploratory committee. Yeah. The first thing the exploratory committee is gonna do is find out who the hell is Duncan Hunter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden's former hideout is being converted into a million-dollar tourist resort. Yeah, the resort will be called 'Six Flags Cave of Terror.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are wondering what the Republicans are gonna use as their secret weapon to help turn the election around, you know? Who would have guessed it would be John Kerry?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Kerry insisting he did not mean to insult the troops. He said it was a joke, that he screwed up. Which is hard to believe. You know, Kerry is usually hilarious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all fairness to Senator Kerry, it's hard to tell -- you can't tell when he's joking. You know, all the botox keeps him from smiling, so you can't...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry is still pretty mad. You see what he said about the press secretary, Tony Snow? This is what he said -- he said he was a 'stuffed shirt white house mouthpiece standing behind a podium.' John Kerry calling you a stuffed shirt? Isn't that like Mark Foley calling you a pervert?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush immediately commenting on Senator Kerry. Here he is on the radio yesterday. Listen to President Bush. Listen to what he said.&quot; Bush: &quot;Anybody who has -- who is in a position to serve this country ought to understand the consequences of words.&quot; Leno: &quot;That's right. And who knows better how to use words than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Google trends, which tracks, you know, what people look up on the Internet, people in the world most likely to look up homosexual activity are in Saudi Arabia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Congressman Mark Foley -- I love this story. He's decided to remain in rehab even though his 30-day treatment ended last Tuesday. Apparently, phony alcoholism is the trickiest type of alcoholism to treat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration now spending tens of millions of dollars on an ad campaign to convince unmarried adult Americans -- adult Americans -- that are unmarried to stop having sex. This is true. So we're trying to stay the course in Iraq and stop the intercourse here at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of Iran is now trying to increase tourism from America. They want American tourists to visit there. Isn't that amazing? Pretty catchy slogan, too ? 'Iran, where the past not only comes alive, it's still here.' Which is better than the old slogan ? 'Death to America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you call an American tourist in Iran? A hostage!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lawyer up in Maine was arrested for dressing up like Osama bin Laden and waving a fake gun in traffic. And while he was out there on the road, a number of people tried to run him over. Not 'cause he was dressed as Osama bin Laden -- 'cause they found out he was a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a strange thing happen last night. A knock on my door. I open it. It's a kid, says, 'Trick-or-treat.' And I go, 'Trick-or-treat? Aren't you, like, two days late?' He goes, 'No, I'm dressed as a FEMA worker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry was trying to tell a joke, trying to be funny, and he botched the joke. Not as easy as it looks is it, John.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this guy was smart, right about now, John Kerry would be blaming it all on a drinking problem and entering rehab.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here is good news. Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney got full endorsement from President Bush. That's like Curly and Larry getting a vote of confidence from Moe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry &quot;apologized and some political analysts are now saying that Senator John Kerry's botched joke about the troops hurt his chances at becoming president in 2008. Yeah, apparently, Kerry's chances at becoming president went from zero to less than zero.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all heard about the big accident today, right? Did you know about that? Yeah, pretty, pretty gruesome. Apparently, a number of Republicans running from George Bush collided with a bunch of Democrats running from John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry has apologized for saying those who do not study hard and do their homework will get stuck in Iraq. On the other hand, those who do not campaign well and are really boring will get stuck in the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said it was meant to be a 'Bush is stupid' joke and he screwed it up. Which is pretty hard to do, screw up a 'Bush is stupid' joke? That's like screwing up a Clinton sex joke. It's almost impossible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you ever think the Democrats would miss the wit and charisma of Al Gore? It's hard to believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sad thing is Kerry didn't get this much attention when he was running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry's now taken himself off the campaign trail and gone home to his wife. That's how you know things are not going well for Democrat, when they go home to their wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pastor Ted Haggard, who has close ties to the Bush Administration, has resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals after a gay male hooker said he had a three-year paid relationship with him. In fact, this is such a huge crisis for Republicans -- listen to this -- they are now offering John Kerry $1 million to tell another joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Pastor Haggard is a man of the cloth, a well-respected man of the cloth. Okay, it's a loincloth, apparently, but hey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say he used church funds to pay for the male prostitute. That's like robbing Paul to pay for Peter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pastor Haggard also admitted to buying crystal meth. Is that unbelievable? He's buying crystal meth. He said he did buy the drugs, but then he threw them away. Right now, Keith Richards is mad at him. 'You idiot, what are you doing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After denying it, today, Haggard resigned after admitting what he called some indiscretions. You ever notice when Republicans catch Democrats doing something, it's a crime against nature. It's a crime against God's will. When conservatives get caught playing the pirate and the slave boy, it's an indiscretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British government announced yesterday it's easing its restrictions for carry-on luggage on the airlines. For example, toothpaste can now be put in carry-on bags. In fact, you know what you call someone in England with toothpaste on a carry-on bag? A tourist, that's what you call them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a group called the information commission in England, machines will soon be running things in Britain. Because of their independence and high-tech surveillance and all their equipment, machines could be in charge of everything there. Hey, it worked for us here in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what, Tuesday is election day, you folks ready to vote? Yup, it's all over but the crooked vote counting now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger is so confident of being re-elected that he's groping women again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to First Lady Laura Bush, 60 years old on Saturday for Laura Bush. President Bush says that marrying Laura was the smartest decision he ever made. And yeah, I think that sounds about right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Laura is 60 years old, and you know, honestly it's nice to see a Bush whose numbers are going up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict in Saddam Hussein's trial is expected to be announced this Sunday. And folks, if the verdict is guilty, Saddam could be hanged. Yeah. Yeah, if he's found innocent, Saddam's going to move to Florida and play golf with OJ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of a Christian group has resigned after allegations surfaced that he's frequently paid a man for sex. And people are shocked, because this guy's always been a critic of gay marriage. Yeah. In his defense, the Christian leader said, 'Hey, it's not like I married the guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton are being criticized by republicans because the Clintons often use the same lines in speeches they give. Yeah. I think they are right because yesterday Hillary looked at a woman in the front row and said, 'Nice rack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC is reporting that the average poll worker for Tuesday's elections will be 72, and that many of these seniors are not comfortable with computerized voting machines. Yeah. Which explains why the projected winner is expected to be Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you believe this weather? What was it, 94 degrees today? It was so hot, I was sweating like a gay evangelist on meth reading 'Leviticus.' That's how hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Pastor Ted Haggard has resigned as leader of the New Life Church. I guess he had to resign when everybody found out about his new life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now over the weekend, Haggard issued a statement saying he is a deceiver and a liar. See, to me, I think it's way too soon to announce you're going into politics.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another accusation is that Pastor Haggard did methamphetamine. I think that's one of the reasons why he was such a popular minister. He could do an hour and a half service in like five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big jump in oil prices over the weekend. Price of oil went up, and the Republicans are furious at the oil companies. They said, 'You idiots! We said wait till after Tuesday, but no, you had to do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things do not look good for the Republicans tomorrow. In fact, even Saddam Hussein said today, 'I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know over the weekend, Saddam Hussein was found guilty and sentenced to death. So see, LA, it can be done! Celebrities can be convicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so dramatic. Like the judge said, 'Saddam will be hung until dead.' They always say that in a sentence. Hanged until dead. But do we need the undead -- until dead part? Isn't that pretty obvious, until dead? You ever heard the sentence, 'You'll be hanged until you experience some severe throat discomfort.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The unemployment rate came out. It's down to 4.4%, lowest in the world. One of the lowest in the world. Which is good news for Republicans. Yeah. That means after tomorrow, they'll be able to find jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the only good news President Bush is going to get tomorrow is from Geico. That's about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that both Cheney and Rumsfeld will remain with him for the rest of his second term. You know what that means -- whatever they got on the President, it must be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the election tomorrow, you know what Vice President Dick Cheney is doing? He is going to spend the day hunting at his lodge in South Dakota. Isn't that unbelievable? That's the one place you want to be if the Republicans lose, Cheney with a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry's been laying low, too. Reporters called his home trying to get a comment. And all they got was Kerry's answering machine. See, they knew it was Kerry's answering machine 'cause it had no message. So they knew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to political ad trackers, you know how much money has been spent on elections so far this year? Well, it's over now really. But $2.6 billion! Billion! $2.6 billion! That works out to $8.60 per person. How many would rather have the eight bucks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been getting any of those stupid prerecorded phone calls from candidates telling you to vote tomorrow? Is there anybody that doesn't know you have to vote tomorrow? And if you don't know you have to vote, this is the first time you heard it, don't vote, 'cause you're an idiot. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Bill Clinton made one of those computer dialing messages. Clinton's got one out. Yeah. And you can tell it was Clinton, 'cause if a man answers, he hangs up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of Iran is promoting tourism. For real. They want Americans to visit Iran. Isn't that unbelievable? Now, we all know Iranians don't like Americans, but to be fair, they do treat us better than the French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starting this week, Texas will be broadcasting live images of the US border with Mexico on the Internet. This is security program asking the public to report signs of illegal immigration. It's like hours of footage of just cactus and sand. ... And here's the sad part, still getting better ratings than our NBC prime time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tomorrow is election day. You folks getting ready to vote? The only thing that can stop Democrats now is a last minute joke from John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are favored to win most races. As a matter of fact, the only Republican in Washington whose seat is safe is Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there has been so much trouble in the years past with voting irregularities, they have a new electronic thing and all you really have to do is you just punch the screen for your candidate. You just punch the screen, which if you watch the show, people are used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death. I don't know. Kind of hate to see him go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam personally was disappointed with the verdict and, you know -- he thought he was going to be able to retire on his own, like Bob Barker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he is sentenced to death. And how they are going to do it is, he is going to be forced to go hunting with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yep, Saddam Hussein found guilty. Yesterday in Iraq, after Saddam Hussein was found guilty, there was celebratory gunfire in the streets. Yeah. Unfortunately, it couldn't be heard over the regular gunfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey of Americans says that Saddam Hussein's conviction and execution will make no difference to them. Yeah. Yeah, after he heard this, Saddam said, 'Really? 'Cause it will make a huge difference to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, voters are more likely to vote for a candidate who has good looks and charisma. Yeah. Yeah, if you want proof, just ask that stud Dennis Hastert.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Florida on the last day of campaigning, a Republican politician refused to appear in public with President Bush because the President is so unpopular. Yeah, and it's worse than it sounds because the politician was former Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, and welcome, disenfranchised voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story, the voting is finished. Soon, we'll know the results. But enough about 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, election day. I tell you, I came in, I see lines around the block. And I realize, eh, it's just for Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All day on the cable news channels, they're very dramatic. They kept saying, 'Today is the moment of truth. It comes down to the moment of truth.' You know, I have watched this entire campaign. I have not seen one moment of truth in the whole thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, they made improvements. I was able to vote much quicker, much faster than the last time. Like now, they have a separate line for illegal immigrants to vote. So it's easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GOP was concerned about republican turnout. And in fact, between the Congressmen and the preachers, this will be the first year more Republicans came out than turned out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both parties on pins and needles today. Especially Ted Kennedy. You see him? Oh, man. Not about the outcome, about the bars being closed on election day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know where Vice President Dick Cheney went today? You know what he did today? Yeah, he went hunting. He went hunting. Isn't that hard to believe? It's lawyer season already!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just so glad those stupid automated phone calls have ended. You know those people are calling? I got one from John Kerry. I didn't think he was even -- play that one. I taped it on my answering -- play that one.&quot; &quot;John Kerry&quot;: &quot;Hello, this is John Kerry reminding you to vote this November 7th. Although, come to think of it, none of you listened to me when I asked you to vote for me two years ago. Never mind. Vote or don't vote, I don't care anymore. Do what you want, you lazy bastards!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pastor Ted Haggard has been forced to step down after being caught with a gay male prostitute. Which is quite a shock for his supporters. And all this time, they thought he was a George Bush Republican. Turns out he was a George Michael Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, a court in Iraq has found Saddam Hussein guilty, sentenced him to death. Hey, you know, let me tell you -- hey. I told Saddam, get yourself a good Jewish lawyer. Oh, no, he wouldn't listen to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Democrats believe the timing of the verdict was manipulated by the White House. Which of course, the White House says that's ridiculous. They were so busy manipulating the price of oil before the election, they didn't have time to work on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This seems like a waste of money. The Bush Administration now spending millions of dollars to promote abstinence for single people. Not just kids and teenagers, adults. Adults, 30 and under, they want to promote abstinence. You thought just say no to drugs didn't work? Oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1860, former Illinois Congressman Abraham Lincoln defeated three other candidates for the presidency. President Bush spoke about this today. Said he was a big fan of Abraham Lincoln because he did great things, like of course, inventing the penny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the president of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, has agreed to return to the negotiating table. Turns out he was there the whole time. He was just so short, we didn't see him at the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was just an American problem. It turns out, I read today, there are over 60 million obese people in China. Yeah. In fact, now, the government army tanks are just bouncing off the Chinese protestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's ironic because the Republicans said they always wanted to appeal to minorities. Now they are one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad a shape they're in, the only Republican now with a mandate is Congressman Mark Foley. That's the only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the oil companies -- the oil companies -- they're furious with the Republicans, too. They said today, 'We lowered gas prices for two months. You still lost? You owe us $8 billion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush thinks he'll win in Iraq, couldn't even win over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld has been let go. ... That's when you know your party is unpopular. When you lose your job, it's not even elected office. ... Insiders described Rumsfeld's reaction as shocked and awed. That's what they said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God, how does that make Rumsfeld feel? I mean, when George Bush tells you you're not competent enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love the way these guys spin. Did you hear Rumsfeld's spin on this? He said, 'No, no, this is all planned.' He was just staying long enough until he felt we were able to govern ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, as if he wasn't having a bad enough day, when Rumsfeld got in line at the unemployment office, got stuck behind Kevin Federline. Unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the results hold up, George Allen will no longer be able to put the word 'senator' in front of his name. He'll have to go back to his old title, 'imperial wizard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He [Allen] was just two racial slurs away from winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here in California, the voters overwhelmingly decided they do not want Arnold Schwarzenegger to ever make another movie, so apparently, they've decided that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, democratic senator Dianne Feinstein defeated republican Dick Mountjoy. That's his name -- Dick Mountjoy. ... What kind of name is that? Isn't that Bill Clinton's secret service code name, Dick Mountjoy? What is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Carolina, Republican Governor Mark Sanford was turned away at the polling place because he didn't have a voter registration card. He's the governor. Yeah. See, in some places, you need either a voter registration card or a valid Mexican driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news -- now that the election is over, if you want to hear an annoying political speech, you'll just have to go to a Barbra Streisand concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Dave Letterman and I'm back for another term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a big day. Earlier today the democrats removed the duct tape from John Kerry's mouth. He's back and ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that race in Virginia. Still too close to call. Still too close to call in Virginia. Believe me, this is where the Republicans shine, the crooked recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld has resigned. The new secretary of defense is a guy named Robert Gates. ... But Rumsfeld took it pretty well. He said he's eager now to move on and try to legalize torture in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a lot of trouble when I vote. I had to vote on one of those new electronic voting machines. Anybody else vote on that? What you have to do is you have to touch the screen on the new electronic voting machine. I haven't done that since the Paris Hilton video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day for news ... Earlier today secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld announced he is stepping down. ... Yeah, Rumsfeld said, 'I made the decision after it became clear that I couldn't do my job effectively, and then I waited three years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad, bad, day for President Bush. ... Earlier tonight, President Bush said he's disappointed with the outcome of the voting. Yeah, of course he was talking about the show 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton's overwhelming victory has fueled speculation that she will run for president in 2008. ... Yeah, in other words, there was some good news for Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- everybody counted him out, but he was reelected. And he said he plans to use the next four years to showcase California as a one-of-a-kind model of bipartisan cooperation. Of course it was much funnier when Arnold said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story, you know, the Republicans lost both houses. They're actually having a worse week than Kevin Federline. He only got kicked out of one house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was asked by the press today if he was ready for bipartisanship in the Senate. And Bush said he had no problem with anyone who was bipartisan, as long as they don't try to get married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Bush had lunch with the new Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. I believe the main course was Rumsfeld's head on a platter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And right before his big lunch with Nancy Pelosi, there was one uncomfortable moment when President Bush was told that the person he was about to have lunch with publicly called him an incompetent liar. Bush said, 'Dad's here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since she becomes America's first female Speaker of the House, that means she is now second in line to be commander-in-chief, right behind Dick Cheney. So she's literally a heartbeat away from the guy who barely has a heartbeat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big political news, John Kerry came out of the closet today, literally. The Democrats said, 'Okay, let him out. It's fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand a political group is now raising money to have John Kerry become the Democratic candidate for president in 2008. Will that happen? I don't know. It depends on how much money the Republicans can raise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exit polls show the two big problems for Republicans were sex and money scandals. How ironic is that? All these years, they've been attacking Hollywood. Turns out they are Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Nevada have turned down a chance to legalize marijuana. Actually, it looked like they might win 'cause they had the support. But most of the marijuana smokers didn't show up to vote until today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced he was running for president in 2008. What kind of name is that, huh? You know him? What kind of name is Vilsack? Doesn't that sound like some kind of medical problem that old guys get? You know, like, 'I'm Wilford Brimley, have you got enlarged Vilsack?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Germany is filing a war crimes lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for allegedly allowing the torture of prisoners in Iraq and Guantanamo bay. Man, that's when you know you crossed the line, when Germans are accusing you of war crimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, President Bush is going to Vietnam. So looks like he's gonna finally finish up that National Guard duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is in Mexico this week on a mission to expedite trade between California and Mexico. He said he's there to break down the barriers on our border. Barriers? What barriers?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Mexico City has passed legislation to legalize gay unions. Gay unions are legal in Mexico. Or as they call it, 'Juan on Juan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pastor Ted Haggard, you know that guy, the big evangelical thing there? Well, he announced that yes, he did meet -- he did meet with that gay male prostitute. Yes, he did meet with him. But nothing happened. He's now claiming it was just a colonoscopy gone horribly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pastor Haggard announced he is going to spiritual rehab that will last three to five years. ... He said the godly men will cure him by the laying on of hands. You know, let me tell you something. If you think you'll be cured of being gay by having a bunch of guys touch you for five years, keep dreaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had an audience last night, and I hate talking about people when they're not here, it was very quiet last night. It was quieter than dinner at Pastor Haggard's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody still talking about the big election, and the experts are saying that Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign, they spent more money than anybody else. And you know why? Well, I'll tell you why, those pantsuits are expensive. Pricey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are more $2 bills in circulation now than at any time. I thought they were done, but, no $2 bills. Great for me, just in time to hand out the holiday bonuses. ... On the $2 bill is Thomas Jefferson, and on the $3 is Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US military has begun using Blackhawk helicopters and interceptor jets to patrol the Canadian border. Did you know that? Yeah, yeah. A US military spokesman explained, 'They already got one Celine Dion past us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Iraqi officials, Saddam Hussein is expected to be hanged at the end of December. Yeah, end of December, yeah. And, folks, you can watch it live on 'Baghdad's Rockin' New Year's Eve.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal agents raided the offices of several doctors who prescribed medical marijuana. They raided the offices. ... During the raid the Feds yelled, 'Put your hands up, and stop staring at them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this past weekend, we celebrated Veterans Day. President Bush took a moment to thank his father for keeping him from becoming one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's dad is stepping in to help with Iraq. And is he not happy. This is going to be the first time a sitting president could be grounded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soon, President Bush will hold the annual event where he pardons the turkeys. You know about that. And today, Jack Abramoff and Tom DeLay said, 'Gobble, gobble, gobble.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Butterball hotline is up and running. ... Lot a great advice this year. For example -- you know pastor, Ted Haggard? ... Well, he had a tip for avoiding the groggy effects of tryptophan. You know about this? Just a pinch of crystal meth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week the Democrats set a new record. They picked up more seats than Mark Foley did when he was a congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see last week, President Bush and Nancy Pelosi meeting with reporters after they had their lunch together? Boy, you thought Bill and Hillary were good at putting on phony smiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to ABC News, John McCain is forming an exploratory committee to run for president. Not to be outdone, Hillary Clinton is also forming an exploratory committee just to try and keep track of her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news today about Fidel Castro's health. It's getting worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Associated Press, Fidel Castro is not expected to live much past 2007. And they say he's worth $900 million. In fact, earlier today, Anna Nicole Smith seen paddling towards Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Buffalo, the nation's third-oldest zoo, which is under a $75 million renovation, may not receive accreditation because the elephant house is not up to standards. The elephants may have to be removed. Phew. Not a good time to be Republican, huh? Even their mascot's getting kicked out of the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rainy and gloomy today in New York City, wasn't it? It was so rainy and so gloomy earlier today President Bush accepted the resignation of Al Roker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of changes after the elections last week. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, out, Dennis Hastert is out. You know, he is going to be all right. Don't worry about Dennis Hastert. As a matter of fact, one year from now he will be on Oprah in a bikini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading where six Arab states say they want to develop nuclear technology. Yeah, I would be worried about that, if it wasn't such a stable part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Bush is leaving for Vietnam. I guess this time his father couldn't get him out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty serious. Germany is filing a war crimes lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld because they say he tortured prisoners. Yeah. And they're going to throw the book at him, believe me. It's the book they wrote, so they know what they're talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Germany suing us for war crimes. That's like the British telling us to brush our teeth three times a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush met with the three big US automakers at the White House. Give you an idea of how well things are going -- the three big US automakers are now Tonka, Matchbox and Hot Wheels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal Energy Department announced that gas prices are skyrocketing just a week after the election. I'm shocked! Well, who could have seen that coming? Huh? Or as they're now calling it, 'Cheney's revenge.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush met with the ten-member Iraqi Study Group to hear their assessment of Iraq. Now they're studying it. Good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, I guess they're now preparing the report. I believe we have an advanced copy. Here it is. It's called -- here's the report by the Iraqi Study Group. It's called, 'We are so screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this evening, President Bush left for Vietnam. I understand he's wearing his old National Guard uniform. He's going to pretend he's late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold has announced he will not -- he will not -- run for President in 2008. He said he made the decision after the latest straw poll, which showed him losing by 23% to the straw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the second week in a row, the number one movie, 'Borat' this week, bringing in more than $29 million. Actually, normally they would do this, but the producer of 'Borat' said there won't be a sequel 'cause it is too hard to fool people the second time around, as the Republicans found out last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2008, Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, may run for president. And he's going to -- if elected he'll attack a no-nonsense approach to Iraq, and the first thing he's going to do over there is get rid of the squeegee guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's in Asia right now, and because of the metric system over there, his approval rating is actually 62.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the news. After winning re-election last week, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made a quick visit to Mexico. That's right. Arnold said he went to Mexico so he could thank everybody who voted for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say President Bush planned a trip to several foreign countries this week because he's unpopular at home. Yeah. In response, the White House said, 'That's ridiculous. The President is just as unpopular overseas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats say now that they control the House and the Senate, they plan to raise the minimum wage. Yeah, the Democrats say they're raising the minimum wage because something must be done to protect Kevin Federline's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush now in his eight-day trip to China. His approval rating, 31%. Not good. Do you have any idea how unpopular President Bush is now?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold announced this week he will not run for president in 2008. In fact, today he released his supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I didn't even know you had to announce you weren't running. I mean, who calls a press conference ? 'Everybody, please, can I have your attention, please? I'm not running for president!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Times, there's a revolt brewing among the Republicans in the House. Of course, people are shocked by this. There are still Republicans in the House?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent study shows that Osama bin Laden wields a surprisingly low amount of influence over Islamic ideology. They don't listen to him. I don't want to say Osama is losing power, but you know what his Al Qaeda code name is now? Donald Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Germany has filed a lawsuit against Rumsfeld and other American officials for crimes against humanity. Germany! Yeah. I understand Tijuana also suing us for illegal drug use and prostitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toys for Tots is rejecting donations of a Jesus doll 'cause they say it might offend nonreligious people at Christmas. You know how picky nonreligious people are about how they celebrate the birth of Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A team of scientists say pollution may actually be helpful in counteracting global warming because a layer of air pollution high up could help cool the earth. And today the oil companies said, 'That's what we've been trying to tell you!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wherever President Bush goes on his Asian tour, he's greeted by protesters, hundreds of protesters. So, at least they're making him feel at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democrats have chosen Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer to be the House Majority Leader. Steny Hoyer. Wasn't that a character on 'Dukes of Hazzard?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince Charles has ordered a number -- a large number of staff to start commuting to the castle by bicycle to help fight global warming. He says he himself will make a number of changes. He said -- as an example, is what he said, he said, he will now use the royal helicopter less, and the royal train more. Which I think is a great example for all of us. If we all used our royal train more and our royal helicopter less...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman in Brazil is claiming her cat had sex with their dog and delivered a litter of kittens that are half dog, half cat. And President Bush said, 'This is the kind of thing that can happen if you don't outlaw gay marriage.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vegetarians are now praising the NBA for their new non-leather basketballs. You see the new basketball? No animal products in it at all. Kind of like a Big Mac.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, video game fans, do you like the video games? Whoa. Well, guess what, Sony's Playstation 3 came out today. Yep. That's right. Finally some good news for George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, right now, trying to gain international support for the war in Iraq. Today, he met with leaders from several countries in Vietnam. It's true. Experts say that nothing builds support for an unpopular war like a trip to Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More proof that President Bush doesn't quite get it. You know? Over the weekend, while he was in Vietnam, he called Senator John McCain and said to him, 'You know, I stayed at that Hanoi Hilton you're always talking about. It wasn't that bad.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Bush landed in Indonesia, tens of thousands of people lined the streets screaming anti-American slogans and attacking his presidency. Bush said he felt like he was at the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Bush was in Vietnam, he and the other world leaders donned the traditional garb -- the tunic. And again, I think president Bush got a little confused. I think he thought they were pajamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to our latest intelligence, Osama bin Laden is losing his influence and power. I didn't know he was a Republican. Did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda is now looking to recruit women. Which makes you kind of wonder. I mean, what does al Qaeda promise women to get them to become terrorists? I mean, I know they promise the guys, what, 72 virgins? Right? 72 virgins? Well, what do they promise to the women? One guy that's monogamous?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian scientists claim they've created remote control turtles that they use for spying missions. This is real. They use live turtles with little cameras on their shells, yeah. Which is great if you're tailing a snail!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, in Washington, the FDA lifted the ban on silicone breast implants. Hey, one thing about those Democrats, they don't waste any time. Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, they promised us things for the better. We got it. Sounds like a return to the Clinton era. Doesn't it? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was out on a big trip in Southeast Asia, and he met with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Or as Bush calls him, 'Sonny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow at the White House, President Bush will pardon the turkey. It's that time of year for him to pardon the turkey. Today, Dick Cheney spent all day torturing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is finishing up a trip to Vietnam. Yesterday, he went to Ho Chi Minh City. He was in Ho Chi Minh City. Unfortunately, when Bush addressed the crowd, he said, 'Greetings, Hos.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first time President Bush has visited Vietnam. His first time there. Afterwards, the President said, 'It's nice here. I don't know what John McCain's talking about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John Kerry says he's thinking about running for president in 2008. Yeah. In other words, Kerry is still telling bad jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the controversy over the OJ Simpson book and interview, Fox reportedly offered &quot;the Brown family, you know, Nicole Simpson's sister, millions in hush money if they would keep quiet.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all have a nice Thanksgiving? Yeah, how many didn't give thanks yesterday until their relatives actually went home? Yeah, yeah. Actually, we had a very Hollywood thanksgiving. My wife and I, this year we adopted a gay turkey from Africa with a substance abuse problem and then took it to rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I understand former President Bill Clinton called the Butterball Hotline and hung up when he realized it wasn't a dating service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you hear what happened in Argentina? First Daughter Barbara Bush had her purse stolen. You hear about this? Yeah, she was eating at a restaurant. Somebody snatches her purse. You know the sad part? You know what was in that purse? Her father's plans for Iraq. Now we have to start all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people wondering if President Bush would be mad at his daughter for losing her purse. Hey, he lost the House and the Senate. Don't worry about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Henry Kissinger says the war in Iraq is unwinnable. And believe it. If there's anybody who knows how not to win a war, it's Henry Kissinger, ladies and gentlemen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said he is still considering a White House run in 2008. And he insisted his botched joke will not undermine his campaign. His botched personality might, but not the joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexican President Vicente Fox has dedicated one of the most powerful telescopes in the world on top of a 15,000 foot-high mountain in central Mexico. He says this way he can use it to check on his people in L.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a pretty amazing story. You may have heard about this. A high school student in Rochester Hills, Michigan, has created nuclear fusion in his parents' basement. He made a reactor in his parents' basement. The bad news? His name is Abdullah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been thinking how I can describe the typical Letterman family Thanksgiving to you folks, and here's what it is ? it's like the ? it's like the Sunni triangle with pie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year, of course, they have, like, the national turkey, and then the big deal is that President Bush will come out on to the White House lawn and he will pardon the national turkey, and so we -- we went through this thing, and they -- and they pardon it, and then the national turkey was adopted by Madonna. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But every year, President Bush gets to pardon one turkey, and this year it was Donald Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving. I got some little, nice, happy news, actually. Yesterday -- this is a true story -- the two turkeys that were pardoned by President Bush; you know, every year, the President pardons one or two turkeys. Well, yesterday, the two turkeys pardoned by President Bush were flown to Disney World to be grand marshals of Disney's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Isn't that nice? I thought it was sweet. Yeah. Then the President pardoned a ham and appointed it to the Supreme Court. It's very conservative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. The animal rights group PETA says that instead of eating a turkey dinner yesterday, people should have feasted on tofu turkey, vegetarian stuffing and a vegan apple pie. Yeah. Which explains why nobody invites PETA members over for Thanksgiving; that's the worst sounding meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez greeted a crowd of supporters by telling lame jokes and making cruel remarks about President Bush. No, I'm sorry, that was the Barbra Streisand concert. I'm sorry. I get them confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and after getting their purse stolen in Argentina, and all of the publicity about it, the security is so bad for the Bush twins. You know, the two daughters were down there, had their purse stolen, and of course it's in all of the papers. The U.S. Embassy has asked them to leave Argentina. And they said no. They said no, they weren't going to leave. Like father, like daughter. They have no exit strategy either. Once they're there, they're there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day here in New York City. What a lovely, warm, very warm -- yeah. When it's a nice day like this, are you like me? Bring on that global warming. Huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is trying to raise $500 million for the Bush Presidential Library. Not just a library, it will also contain a think tank. Because when you think George W. Bush, you think thinking, am I right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney visited Saudi Arabia over the weekend. And he's very popular in Saudi Arabia. Over there he's known as Lawrence of Arrhythmia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visited Estonia today. And he thanked the Estonian president for sending troops to Iraq. That's nice. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Bush ? Bush's exact quote was, 'Those two guys are doing a great job.' It's not a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week -- this is the latest -- President Bush is planning to attend a two-day NATO summit to discuss strategies for the war in Afghanistan.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this week's 'Time' magazine, there is an article on whether Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney could be president. The title of the article is, 'Can a Mormon be President of the United States?' Sure, I think a Mormon could be president. Huh? I think a Mormon would be a fine president. Stand up there, have the President and the 18 first ladies. You know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the cover story of 'Time' magazine this week is about how we worry about things -- worry about the wrong things. We don't worry about the things we should worry about. For example, after all this fuss, you know not one person in America got the bird flu? Not one. Yet over 17,000 people have been hit by Lindsay Lohan's car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's ? here's kind of a fascinating change of ideology. NBC has announced that they will now refer to the Iraqi war as a civil war. They're calling the conflict in Iraq a civil war. That's NBC News. And President Bush responded. He says, 'No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's not a civil war until it becomes a series of 'Time Life' books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's great news for the holidays -- the Christmas tree was delivered to the White House yesterday. That's nice. Just what we need at the White House: More dead wood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC News is in some hot water. The Bush Administration is upset with NBC News, because NBC News has started referring to the situation in Iraq as a civil war.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon is, of course, making some decisions on Iraq. The Pentagon is trying to convince Germany to send more troops to the war in Iraq. Yeah. This marks the first time anyone has asked the Germans to send more troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush keeping busy. President Bush is putting together his presidential library. That's right, he's putting together his presidential library.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a really frightening story. This is like some 007 thing. You been following this story about this Russian spy they believe was poisoned?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a recent NBC hidden camera investigation, sensitive information about our nuclear power plants is available in our public libraries; in our public libraries.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his trip to the NATO summit meeting, President Bush stopped in Estonia to thank them for their help in Iraq. You know what a huge help the Estonians have been.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very excited. Al Gore, on the show tonight, and so is supermodel Karolina Kurkova. What a coincidence that is. I mean, we have the guy who invented the Internet and the reason most guys go on the Internet on the same show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, there's talk ? there's talk that Vice President Gore could win an Oscar for his movie, the global warming movie, 'An Inconvenient Truth.' How about that? This will be his first win -- well, if he does get it, it would be his first win since the presidency in 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Senator Bill Frist, the Republican Majority Leader, announced this morning, this very morning, that he will not be running for president in 2008. Well, did you see the response to this announcement? Show the response when he made the announcement.&quot; [Editor's note: At this point in the show, the camera showed a tumbleweed blowing across an empty desert landscape.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had some trouble here last night with the audience. I hate to talk about people when they're not here. What a rough, rough crowd. What a rough... As a matter of fact, last night CBS classified the show as a civil war. Horrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well anyway, the United States now, listen to this, has banned the sale of iPods to North Korea. And you thought President Bush didn't have a plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An historical date today. On this date in 1947, the U.N. voted to create the state of Israel. I'm glad they settled that. Things are going just fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's is Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, by the way, is a Norway spruce. It's a Norway spruce, yeah. Experts say -- yeah. There you go, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story about the holidays: 40% -- 40% of American business owners say they are going to give their employees holiday bonuses instead of having a holiday party. No holiday party this year, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, which means thousands of office workers will have to get drunk and go to Kinkos to Xerox their ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House keeping busy. The White House announced today it was banning the sale of iPods to North Korea. Yeah, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President of Iran has written a five-page letter to America, attacking our government, a five-page letter. Who has time to read that, huh?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. I believe that's his name. Afterwards, Bush said, 'Maliki is the right man for the job.' Just to remind you, Bush also said FEMA's Michael Brown was the right man for the job, Donald Rumsfeld was the right man for the job, Tom DeLay was the right man for the job, which would be okay if Bush was the right man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, earlier today, in Iowa, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack officially announced he's running for president. He said his number one priority for America, get people to stop giggling at the name Vilsack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Illinois, a mental patient went on trial for threatening to castrate President Bush. Now, he was sentenced to seven months in prison, but a Federal judge let him go, because you can't lock people up for threatening to castrate the President.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had former Vice President Al Gore on the show last night, talking about global warming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Kerry, poor John Kerry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House is not happy. Did you know this? They're unhappy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the government, the U.S. Government has unveiled 144 new questions -- 144 new questions -- that immigrants will have to answer when taking the U.S. citizenship test.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, problems with&quot; Mitt Romney: &quot;A main part of his campaign has been attacking, you know, illegal immigration and all that. Well, it turns out his lawn is being taken care of and landscaped by illegal immigrants. Yeah, yeah; not only is he in trouble of politically, Wal-Mart now accusing him of stealing employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama on the show tonight. He reminds me a lot of Bill Clinton, in the sense that he also doesn't tell Hillary what his plans are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Louisiana Congressman Bill Jefferson, the one who got caught with $90,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer, is running an ad saying, 'He never took a bribe from anybody.' I love the way they try to spin this. He said he put the money in the freezer to protect it from global warming. I don't quite buy that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saudi Arabia has threatened to sue global tobacco farms unless they pay for health care. So Saudi Arabia versus the tobacco companies, who do you root for in that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's something scary. Famed physicist Stephen Hawking said that to ensure the survival of our species, we're gonna have to leave the planet. He says that mankind will have to abandon Earth and find another planet to live on. Though he said with current technology, traveling to the nearest livable planet will take 50,000 years. Imagine that, being stuck on Southwest for 50,000 years, huh? I mean, how many connecting flights would that be?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people say, 'Oh, this idea is ridiculous, because a manned space program that big would bankrupt the country.' But I say, 'Who cares? If we're leaving, just write a check.' We're not gonna be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the time of year everybody's getting ready for the holidays. Earlier today, Dick Cheney brought home a Christmas tree that he shot. So that's exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe this. The 2008 presidential race is already heating up. You ready for it? I'm not ready for it. No, I'm not ready. I want it -- like, 2010, I'll be ready for that crap. But not right now. Well, it's heating up. Yesterday, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced he is running for president in 2008. Yeah. That's what he said. Yeah. Yeah, Vilsack will face questions on national security, tax cuts and who the hell he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, my wife and I looked at Christmas trees last night. Went down to the Beverly Hills Tree Rescue Shelter. No, this is where all the trees are cut down in the cruelty-free process. ... Yeah, yeah. What happens is the trees are gently gnawed by very old beavers until they fall over. So the tree is not harmed in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in St. Albans, West Virginia, the city's nativity scene has a manger, shepherds and the guiding star, but no baby Jesus and no Mary and no Joseph, because the town wants to keep church and state separate. Yeah. That's why they named the town St. Albans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush accepted the resignation of UN Ambassador John Bolton. Bolton said he didn't want to leave, but when you have no nations that are united you don't need an ambassador, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had Barack Obama on the show Friday night. People are pretty excited out this guy [cheers and applause]. See what I'm saying? A lot of excitement. But you know what's interesting? They say Hillary Clinton is starting to get a little paranoid about this, because a lot of Democratic Party leaders are getting behind Barack Obama's bid for the presidency. Hillary's worried it might be part of a vast left wing conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in over 20 years, the exam to become an American citizen is being made over; all new exam. In fact, immigrants from Mexico will have to have two tests -- the written test and the new obstacle course. Yeah, you have to ? they've got to swim. They've got to jump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Pfizer has halted their test of a new cholesterol drug because it is causing people to die. People are dying, taking this cholesterol. To give you an idea of how potent it was, today, the Russian government ordered ten cases of this stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know last Thursday was National Methamphetamine Awareness Day? Did you know that? See, a lot of people missed it because the parade went by in, like, five seconds. Zoom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush very hard at work in Washington, right now, trying to solve all the problems. And earlier today, true story, President Bush met with the head of one of Iraq's Shiite political parties. That's right, yeah. Yeah, however, there was an awkward moment when Bush asked him, 'Are you the Shiite head?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Christmas decorations are up. They just put the White House Christmas decorations up. This year, the White House Christmas decorations include a ten-foot tall nutcracker. That's right. It's true, yeah. Experts say this is the biggest nutcracker at the White House since Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Katie Couric ? having her problems, but she's working on it. Several months after taking over the 'CBS Evening News,' CBS says that Katie Couric has decided to make some adjustments to improve ratings. Ratings have been down. She's going to make some adjustments. I think she's getting desperate because the first thing Katie wants to do is hire Matt Lauer and Al Roker. She wants a big window behind her. She wants the news on in the morning for a couple hours...on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week -- this is an interesting story -- Customs officials inspected a flight from Jamaica to Miami and they seized 2 tons of marijuana. Yeah, as a result, the flight arrived in Miami with only 4 tons of marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Christmas, the film 'The Nativity Story' opened over the weekend. This is interesting. Now, did you know that Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus only stayed in the manger one night? Did you know that? See, apparently, Bethlehem authorities came by and told them they couldn't have a nativity scene in a public place, so they had to move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, big problem in Malibu. Did you hear about this? A 30-foot sinkhole opened up on the Pacific Coast Highway. Highway just sunk. You thought President Bush was slow getting Federal aid to rebuild New Orleans. How long is it going to take to bail out Barbra Streisand?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush met with a Shiite leader from the Iraqi parliament. Tomorrow, he hopes to meet with a Shinola leader so he can tell the difference between Shiite and Shinola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, three schools are in the running for the George Bush Presidential Library. I understand the losing school will get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Indiana Senator Evan Bayh announced he is starting a presidential exploratory committee. Right now, the two Democrats throwing their hat in the ring are Tom Vilsack and Evan Bayh. To give you an idea of how unknown these guys are, their Secret Service codenames are Tom Vilsack and Evan Bayh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in New York City, Hillary Clinton spoke to the Democratic Party faithful -- the faithful. So apparently Bill was not there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see Al Gore today? Al Gore was on 'Oprah' talking on global warming. He got so excited about the topic he jumped up and down on Oprah's couch and broke it. Yeah. Put on a few pounds. Global eating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Germany announced this week that it will ban smoking in restaurants, schools and all other public places. The Germans are pretty ? they're pretty ambitious about this issue, yeah. They said if this smoking ban is successful, they will attempt to ban smoking in Poland, France, Czechoslovakia, the Sudan, going up into Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This sounds fantastic, but it's true. Yesterday, NASA announced plans to build a space station on the moon. Build a space station on the moon, yeah. Yeah, when asked where on the moon they would put the space station, a spokesperson for NASA said, 'Between the two Starbucks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, children figure out the truth about Santa Claus between the ages of 3 and 6. Yeah, although the study says that the age is much later for some US presidents. Right now, Bush is calling the Pentagon ? 'What does he mean? Santa's coming, right? He's coming?' 'Yes, sir. He's coming.' 'Oh, okay. All right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear the news? You know Vice President Cheney has a gay daughter. You know that. Mary. Well she's pregnant. Why do I think that's going to be a shotgun wedding?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, she's pregnant now. Apparently, it all began at home during a romantic evening watching a DVD of 'Xena: Warrior Princess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush understands these things. When they told President Bush Dick Cheney's gay daughter was pregnant, he said, 'It's a Christmas miracle!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man from Tacoma, Washington, is in big trouble after faking being mentally retarded for 20 years so he could collect disability benefits. Can you imagine that? He's drawing a paycheck from the taxpayers for pretending to be retarded. Hey, it's worked for Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? This week, NASA announced plans to establish a manned base on the moon. They want to put a base on the moon. They said by establishing this base on the moon, the program will create a number of high-tech jobs, which is, of course, good news for India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, NASA also said another advantage of going to the moon is, other countries would be involved. And it would build a friendly, competitive atmosphere among nations. Nations would be able to compete without hostility. You know, like we do now in World Cup soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraq Study Group report came out today. That's right. The Iraq Study Group report was released as a book this morning. And after only a few hours, it soared to number 18 on Amazon's bestsellers list. Yeah. Yeah, they even got President Bush to buy a copy because they called it 'Harry Potter and the Iraq Study Group Report.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, Mary, and her partner, Heather Poe, announced that they're going to have a baby. Mary and Heather Poe, yeah.

It's kind of strange for the average American. See, we're not used to seeing someone sneaking across the border from the north. It's really -- they usually come the other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the most popular toy is in Russia is this year? It's the Poison Me Elmo, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, hey. Today is the 65th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. That was 65 years ago. Actually, the Japanese are a lot more clever now. Now, they only make a couple of Playstations 3s, then they sit back and watch us kill ourselves trying to get one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Embarrassing moment at the White House Christmas party. You hear about this? Laura Bush showed up in an $8,500 red Oscar de la Renta gown, and three other women showed up wearing the exact same gown. Actually, two women and Congressman Mark Foley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was even angrier. He said every guy at the party had the same tuxedo as he was wearing, black with the white shirt and the black bowtie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a special government commission, the Iraqi Study Group, has spent eight months, the last eight months studying the situation in Iraq and concluded that our policy in Iraq is not working. Took eight months for that? What, are these guys getting paid by the hour? Hello? Talk about government work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier in the week, NASA announced plans to establish a manned base on the moon. President Bush was quick to point out we're only planning to stay on the moon until the moon people are able to govern themselves.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, although -- although the project will be very expensive, President Bush said it can be done cheaply with his guest worker program using actual aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also suggested we wait until there's a full moon so there are more places to land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's something interesting. I found this hard to believe. But I checked it out, and it is true. A Norwegian businessman has opened a lab in Miami that will take the fat liposuctioned out of chubby Americans and turn it into biodiesel fuel. Isn't it amazing? Well, if Al Gore keeps eating, he could save the planet himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, imagine that, turning human fat into biodiesel fuel. In fact, this guy said, theoretically, one chubby Clinton girlfriend could power a small city for a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story in Washington now, Vice President Cheney's lesbian daughter, Mary, is pregnant. That must have been one wild White House Christmas party, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, I don't think Bush understands this whole alternative lifestyle thing. In fact, when he heard Mary was pregnant, he said, 'Who's the lucky gay guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big guessing game in Washington now is who donated the sperm? I'm guessing Ann Coulter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York City has banned the sale of transfat in all the restaurants. Transfat ? doesn't it sound like an airline for really obese people or something like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has warned Western leaders to 'follow the path of God or vanish from the face of the Earth.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraq Study Group was released as a book yesterday. Today, it's number two on Amazon's bestseller list. Yeah. Publishing insiders are already calling it the 'Tuesdays With Morrie' of bipartisan commission findings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is December 7th, the 65th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Or, as President Bush refers to it, 'a day that will live in the infirmary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you have heard about this report the Iraqi Study Group? Have you been following this story? They said by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, for the current situation in Iraqi, we traded one nightmare for another. That's what they said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know the part of the Iraqi report that concerns President Bush the most? Having to read it -- 96 pages!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey, you been following this story of this former Russian spy they think may have been poisoned with polonium? Is that how you say it, polonium-210? Isn't that a freeway over here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they think someone may have sprayed him in the face with a deadly radioactive mist. You know, that happened to me at the mall when I went to the fragrance department at Macy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And exciting news from the White House. Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter, Mary, who is a lesbian, is pregnant. And I think President Bush is a little confused about the good news. He immediately called the Lebanese ambassador to pass on his congratulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to of this. Here's the amazing part. You know who's delivering the baby? Halliburton; yeah, apparently, they got the contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Mary Cheney said today she doesn't care if it's a boy or girl, so long as it grows up to become a gym teacher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how's this for hypocrisy? Starting in January, Washington, D.C. will be smoke-free. You'll not be allowed to smoke anywhere in Washington, D.C. Although, Washington lawmakers exempted themselves from the D.C. smoking ban, as well as rules against smoking in Federal buildings. You know why lawmakers made the exception for themselves? You know why they did it? Force of habit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and look at this. Look at this. Today, the House Ethics Committee ? there's two words that go together. House Ethics Committee released its report on Mark Foley. You know, the congressman who was hitting on the underage boys? Well, they found willful ignorance, but no rules were broken. They said the whole thing was proper according to the law. Okay, Cardinal Bernard Law, but hitting on kids is not a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, who was chairing this committee, Michael Jackson?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's something kind of embarrassing. Yeah, the -- you see this on the news? The White House Christmas tree fell over today. Apparently, leaning too far to the right, I think that was the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Tyler, Texas, a 75-year-old woman fought off a carjacker at a gas station by pumping gasoline at the guy. She doused the guy with gasoline. Yeah, how about that? The bad news; the gas cost her twice as much money as she had in her purse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today -- I don't know if you heard -- just a couple hours ago, the Christmas tree in front of the White House fell over. Yeah, no one was hurt. It just fell over. Yeah. Yeah. And even after the tree collapsed, President Bush insisted that the tree was doing a heck of a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study has found that one in seven Mexican workers are employed in the United States. Yeah. It's true. One in seven Mexican workers is employed in the United States. Apparently, the other six just live here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story. Conservatives in Iran -- imagine being a conservative in Iran. Conservatives in Iran are very upset at the Iranian president because video footage has surfaced of the Iranian president watching a group of female dancers who weren't wearing veils; apparently scandalous, scandalous, yeah. Yeah, it's hard to tell where the footage was shot, but it looks like one of those seedy no-veil clubs out by the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see this on the news the other night? The Christmas tree at the White House fell over. Yeah. Actually, it didn't fall over. What happened was President Bush was standing next to it when a photographer walked in. I guess the tree was trying to distance itself from President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has received a copy of the 96-page Iraqi Study Group report. When they gave it to him, President Bush said, 'Don't tell me how it ends.' And then they said, 'Uh, it doesn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to Senator John Kerry; 63 years old today, Senator John Kerry. Yeah. They threw a surprise party for him. They think he was surprised, because with his personality, it's hard to tell. You know, just ? you know, 'Is he surprised?' 'I don't know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, instead of blowing out the candles, he just talked to them until all the light just flickered out of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Attorney General John Ashcroft is in the news. Remember that guy? He's coming out with a new book. It was just released today. It says, 'Hey, don't blame me, I left in 2005, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. According to a U.N. report, methane gas from cows is more damaging to the environment than automobile emissions. See, this explains why Al Gore has put on so much weight. He is single-handedly trying to rid the world of cows, one cheeseburger at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported that the city of Tehran, in Iran, is having a huge smog problem -- a huge smog problem in Tehran. They're reporting they have smog that's so bad in that city Iranian scientists can't even see the nuclear bomb in front of their face they claim they are not working on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mel Gibson's new movie, 'Apocalypto,' the number one movie in the country. How about that? The number one movie in the country. It's about -- if you haven't seen it, it's about a huge group of people who vanish from Mexico. In fact, the original title was, 'From Here to Wal-Mart,' but they changed it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of Wal-Mart, you hear about this? A man's in a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, shopping in Wal-Mart, a customer -- finds a huge plastic bag filled with cocaine on one of the shelves. And here's the interesting part. It was marked down to $1.35. They really do have low prices. I mean, wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, nobody can figure out how it got there. They are now saying they don't believe the cocaine belonged to an employee because nobody at Wal-Mart can afford cocaine. In fact, one elderly greeter said that he and his wife can barely afford a hit of crystal meth on the weekends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the actor Wesley Snipes has turned himself in to authorities. Wesley Snipes has been arrested. Still no word on bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, we also had the opening of the film, 'Unaccompanied Minors.' Or as Congressman Mark Foley calls it, 'The Greatest Movie Ever Made.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the number one movie this weekend was? 'Apocalypto.' ... It's a Mel Gibson movie and it chronicles the collapse of the Mayan civilization. And you know who Mel is blaming for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, oh, it's a terribly violent motion picture. It shows bloody human sacrifices, and Donald Rumsfeld is calling it the feel-good movie of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about the new Iraq Study Group? They have released their 142-page report. And President Bush has not commented on it. He said, 'I'm not going to comment on this until I've completely ignored it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some good news. Dick Cheney's daughter, who happens to be a lesbian, is pregnant. ... I thought, well, you know, that's great. Good, congratulations, Dick Cheney's pregnant lesbian daughter, that's great. And it gives Dick another excuse to get out the shotgun. That'll be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't believe it, but the 2008 presidential race is already underway. ... Over the weekend, Senator Barack Obama visited New Hampshire. And thousands of people turned up to hear him speak. That's right, yeah. Yeah -- the New Hampshire crowds were excited, because apparently this is the first time they've ever seen an African-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, a baby girl was born onboard a Mexicana Airlines flight from Mexico to the United States. Yeah, yeah. Right after the Mexican baby was born, she said, 'Man that was a small tunnel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report on Iraq, our judgment has been impaired and we have been heading in the wrong direction. I'm sorry, that's the report on Nicole Ritchie. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, President Bush met with Iraq's Vice President. It got a little heated. He said, 'look, just because you're Iraq's Vice President doesn't mean I have to take orders from you, too!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over in Iran, they're having that idiot convention. You know about this? The moron president is having a conference on whether the holocaust took place. Isn't that unbelievable? It's based on Hitler's new book 'If I Did It.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is unbelievable. This is so infuriating. They're acting like they don't believe it happened. See, that's probably 'cause they're still living in the 14th century, so for them, it hasn't happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we should have a conference to see if the crusades ever happened. See how they like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new report by the Migration Policy Institute says there are now 7 million Mexican workers in the United States. 9.4% of all the people born in Mexico are living in the United States, and the rest are expected to be here by the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now that his potential presidential campaign is gaining strength, people are getting more and more interested in the origin of Illinois Senator Barack Obama's name. Fascinating man. Turns out Barack Obama is an old Kenyan name which translates to 'Hillary's worst nightmare.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith from Ohio State? You know, he was taking his Heisman Trophy home with him, and they wouldn't let him through airport security. Yeah, we can't get bin Laden, but we have the Heisman, by God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Kucinich has announced he's running for president in 2008 from Ohio. Some a related story, somewhere a tree fell in the forest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you remember him. Dennis Kucinich, who ran for president in '04, announced he's running against in '08. Coincidentally, '04 is the number of votes Kucinich received.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend -- this is a weird story -- Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith won the Heisman Trophy. ... But today, when he tried to fly home, airline security wouldn't let the Heisman Trophy on board the plane. That's true, yeah. Apparently, the Heisman's been considered a deadly weapon ever since O.J. Simpson won one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, federal agents conducted huge raids in six states and arrested 1,300 illegal immigrant workers at Swift meat-processing plants. I believe this is the biggest raid of a meat packing plant since they stormed Congressman Mark Foley's office.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1,300 illegal workers, or as we call that in L.A., the Home Depot parking lot. 1,300? That's Wednesday. It's expected the illegal will be processed today, they'll be deported on Thursday, and hopefully back to work by Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting lawsuit. A judge has ruled that because all paper money feels the same, the government discriminates against the blind. See, I think that's unfair. The government does not discriminate against the blind. Hey, isn't that who lead us into Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a top Pentagon strategist said today, the war on terror could take 100 years. Today, President Bush warned against setting these timetables. No, President Bush actually said today, 'I will not be rushed into a decision on Iraq.' I guess one time was enough for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of scary, the new head of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Silvestre Reyes, failed a quiz on terrorist organizations. He didn't know the difference between a Sunni and Shiite, didn't seem to know what Hezbollah was -- so apparently, the term 'intelligence committee' is just a suggestion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the idiot president of Iran is holding a conference on whether or not the Holocaust actually took place. The good news, the conference is being catered by Taco Bell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI says there's a surge in these crystal meth labs out in wooded areas. They put them out there to evade detection. And they're urging hunters to be on the lookout for them. They say meth labs hidden in the woods are dangerous because wildlife can unintentionally discover the drugs and eat them. So if you see a bear who should be hibernating, but instead, he's doing jazz-aerobics, approach with caution.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new poll, one in five Americans, believe that they can't trust President Bush. To put it another way, more Americans would be comfortable accepting a ride from Nicole Richie than trusting President Bush!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they had the Iraqi Commission Report and President Bush says he will now not make a decision about getting out of Iraq until 2007. He says he wants to give it some careful thought. Unlike getting us into Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an anniversary. You know what happened on this day in 2003? We found Saddam Hussein. Remember that? And isn't it nice that since Saddam Hussein has been captured we haven't had to worry about terrorism or nuts with nuclear weapons. Everything is so much better now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a top general at the Pentagon said that the war on terror could take 100 years to fight. Yeah, President Bush was furious about the 100-year prediction and said, 'Stop setting a fixed timetable!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christmas shopping got a lot easier for President Bush this year. We have fewer and fewer allies each year to shop for. It makes it easy just that one little gift for England, then we're out. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating over the Iraq war has now dropped down to 24%. In fact, it's so bad, if the election were held today against John Kerry, Kerry would still figure out how to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry is on his way to Iraq. He's going to meet with the troops. Well, that's bound to boost morale, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole country is turning against the war in Iraq, and President Bush is still going in the opposite direction. He's like the Nicole Richie of politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, federal agents arrested 1,300 illegal immigrant workers at six Swift meatpacking plants all across the country. Of course, nobody in management at the meatpacking plant was arrested. They claim they didn't know their employees were using fake identities. 'What? You mean Jose's real name is not Lars Spencin? We're shocked! We had no idea. We thought he was from Sweden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Wal-Mart still has an illegal immigrant problem. You know the Santa at Wal-Mart? He's called Santa Ana. Isn't that different?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush refuses now to rush any decision on Iraq. He said he's going to be listening to advice, he's going to weigh his alternatives, considering his options. He must be drinking again&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact, earlier today down in Washington at the White House, President Bush hosted a malaria summit and at the end of the gathering he promised he would not invade 'Malaria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Awkward moment in Washington yesterday. The new head of the House Intelligence Committee had an embarrassing moment yesterday, when he admitted he didn't know the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite. President Bush said, 'Don't feel bad. I still have trouble with Iran and Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced this week it will not have a new Iraq strategy until after the start of the new year. Apparently, President Bush is hoping Santa will bring him one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear this about this? CNN said today that President Bush is seriously considering sending more troops to Iraq. So apparently, his goal is to achieve a negative popularity rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the former mayor of Cleveland, Dennis Kucinich, announced he is running for president in 2008. Very smart. He's trying to get a head start on being eliminated from the race early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how on-edge employees of illegal immigrants have become, now, instead of saying, 'Welcome to Wal-Mart,' the elderly greeters pull you aside and go, 'Are you a cop?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And maintenance workers for Turkish Airlines celebrated finishing a job ahead of schedule by sacrificing a camel right on the Istanbul Airport tarmac. Unbelievable. They cooked this camel right there in the airport, right in the middle of the, you know, on the tarmac because they finished their job early. Of course, American union members were shocked. 'What, finishing a job early? What, are they nuts? We're stunned. What's wrong with these people? How primitive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And U.S. intelligence believes that Cuban leader Fidel Castro is close to death. Yeah, yeah. Well, I understand -- I understand family members already fighting over his '58 Buick. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so glad you people are here tonight. You seem like a wonderful, nice friendly group and thank God and God bless you. Last night we had a horrible audience.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. The incoming head of the House Intelligence Committee had a very embarrassing moment the other day when he admitted he didn't know the difference between Sunnis and Shiites. Yeah. Yeah, luckily, Sunnis and Shiites both have a great sense of humor about this kind of thing. They're like, 'That's funny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced his new plan to keep Sunnis and Shiites from trying to kill each other. Hey, good luck. We can't even keep the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets from trying to kill each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the heavily favored New Orleans Saints were upset by the Redskins on Sunday. Why is it every time a team of people from Washington come to town, New Orleans gets screwed? Why is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Indiana Senator Evan Bayh dropped out of the presidential race. I didn't know he dropped in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And one of India's top computer service firms announced today it's going to start outsourcing its work to Egypt. They got so much work, they're outsourcing it to Egypt. And You know what's going to happen here? You're going to call India for computer help. The call will get sent to Egypt. They'll be so busy, they'll send it to a company in Arizona that can do it cheaper because they hired illegal workers from Mexico. So everything is just going to go full circle, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of this, did you know about this? Speaking of this, the California company that was hired to build this stupid fence along the border of Mexico has been charged with hiring illegal immigrants. Isn't that unbelievable? It's true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Britain's Prince William. He graduated from the prestigious Sandhurst military academy as an armed officer. President Bush called him to say, 'You know, your dad can get you out of this. It's not too late.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, ladies and gentlemen, there is a new 'Rocky' film opening. Listen to this, the President knew about it and failed to act in time. He knew about it, did nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for a segment. I don't think we have done this segment before on the program, and it's called 'Dick Cheney: Drinking Again?.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today at the White House, President Bush signed a deal that would send nuclear fuel and know-how to India. Yeah, when asked about the Indian deal, president Bush said, 'It's the least we can do after stealing their land.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, over the weekend, Senator Hillary Clinton was asked about President Bush. And she said -- this is a quote ? 'I'm not gonna believe this president again.' Yeah. Yeah, Hillary said, 'To be fair, I stopped believing presidents about ten years ago.' Certainly, she had a bad experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day in Arizona, the FBI arrested a group of military recruiters who were dealing cocaine from their recruiting offices.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know about this? There is now a new law outlawing melting down pennies and nickels for profit. Based on current metal prices, pennies and nickels are worth more if you melt them down. Leave it to the government to figure out a way to lose money while they're making money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course you know we're in the middle of the Hanukkah season. And today, at the White House, a very confused George Bush struck a match and lit a fedora. Yeah, I think he got a little mixed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard by now. What a stupid thing this is. 'Time' magazine has named everyone their person of the year. They said everyone is the person of the year. And somehow, Al Gore still came in second. How did that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today in Maine -- in the state of Maine -- police arrested three illegal Mexican immigrants. How lost were these guys? 'San Diego? San Diego?' Man, that's lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news is, terrorism has been ruled out as a cause of the Taco Bell E. coli outbreak. They ruled even terrorists won't go to Taco Bell. So, they ? they're not that desperate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night at the White House -- true story -- President Bush hosted a Hanukkah party and lit four candles on a menorah. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Or, as President Bush calls the menorah, 'that Jewish flashlight.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Police in Maine recently arrested three illegal Mexican immigrants during a routine traffic stop. Yeah, police became suspicious when they noticed Mexican people in Maine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush had a menorah-lighting ceremony at the White House for Hanukkah. Again, you see, I don't think President Bush understands the Jewish faith.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. This sounds like a tabloid story, but it's being reported in the 'Washington Post.' According to the 'Washington Post,' former President Bill Clinton has received counseling for sex addiction. That's what it says. I don't think it went too well. Yeah. Halfway through the first session, he talked the therapist out of her bra and panties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know what would cure Bill of his sex addiction? Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something fascinating. I did not know this. The biggest cash crop in America is now marijuana: $35 billion a year. You know what the second biggest cash crop is? They don't know, they're so into studying the first one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that, marijuana, the number one agricultural crop in America. I want to thank the band for supporting our farmers, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was all over the news today here in Los Angeles. A one-month-old baby is fine after his grandmother mistakenly put him through the airport x-ray machine at L.A.X. She got on, just put the baby through the x-ray machine. The airport security didn't see the woman put the baby on the conveyor belt. Apparently, they were too busy looking for shampoo bottles and yelling at people to take off their shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, remember Ted Haggard, the preacher that got caught last month with a male prostitute and the crystal meth and all that stuff? Well, another one of his fellow preachers, same church, who works with young adults, had to resign after he, too, admitted to sexual misconduct and poor judgment. Well, now people are calling for a code of ethics for evangelists. Don't we have this? I think it's called the Ten Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this, ladies and gentlemen? President Bush admitted that we are not winning in Iraq. Sounds like Miss USA is not the only one who has sobered up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking about Iraq earlier today, President Bush said that we're not winning, we're not losing. Kind of what I'm doing right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big survey of American sex habits was just released. Just came out -- just came out.

And according to the new study -- this is interesting, 99% of Americans have sex by the age of 44 -- 99%; 99%, yeah. Yeah, the other 1% think &quot;The Revenge of the Sith' was way better than 'Attack of the Clones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, new Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, flew to Iraq to get a firsthand look at the situation over there. Yeah, after surveying the situation, Gates was quoted as saying, 'Uh-oh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, Pope Benedict -- Pope Benedict urged Catholics not to forget the real meaning of Christmas. And not to get caught up in materialism. Yeah. Of course, the Pope gave the speech from the comfort of his jewel-encrusted throne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of holidays, yesterday President Bush delivered his annual Kwanzaa message. ... The President said, 'Let's always remember that Kwanzaa only exists because a guy named Kwan died for our sins.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a sad day. Today was the funeral of President Gerald Ford, passed away at the age of 93. A very nice man. I was fortunate enough to meet him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. &quot;Would it have killed him to wear a tie?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. You know he left his entire estate to the Boys and Girls Club of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Four dollars for a goat dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. I loved it when Chemical Ali sang 'Wind Beneath My Wings.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Not what he had in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Let's start the wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Is it too soon to start hitting on his wives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Ryan Seacrest did a nice job on the countdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Uday and Qusay wanted to be here, but they were too busy rotting in hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. He dropped faster than Bush's poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here &quot;in the United States, in New York City, they dropped -- they celebrate New Year's by dropping the ball off the roof. In Iraq, they celebrate by dropping the dictator through the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So they executed Saddam Hussein. So I guess that means that whole Iraqi thing is over. We can all go home now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very important day here, in America. As you've probably seen, there's been coverage all over the place. Earlier today in Washington, funeral services were held for former President Gerald Ford, and all the living presidents were there. That doesn't happen often. They all got together. Very cool, yeah. President Carter called Ford a wonderful man. Bill Clinton called Ford a true American. And President Bush called Ford 'the guy who invented the automobile.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was released from the hospital after breaking his leg. Yeah. Doctors say Arnold's leg will be broken for two months and his English will be broken forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people talking about this. A cellphone video has surfaced of Saddam Hussein's hanging, and officials are trying to figure out who shot the video. Yeah. People who were at the hanging say it was probably the guy who kept yelling, 'Hey, keep it down! I'm on the phone here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the holidays are over. Of course last night, I see people taking down the lights they hung, and of course, the ornaments they hung. In Iraq, they're taking down the Saddam they hung.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And do you know what Saddam's last words were? Do you know? 'I knew we should have had the trial in L.A.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest reports out of Washington say that President Bush is planning to send more troops to Iraq, but the White House wants to call it a surge instead of an escalation. Well, duh. A one syllable word versus a four syllable word? You wonder which one Bush will pick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And starting January 23rd, people traveling from Canada will need a passport to get into the United States. Yeah. They say it's for security reasons to be able to discern U.S. citizens from non-U.S citizens. You don't need a passport to tell Americans from Canadians, huh? If you see people, like, carrying a big bag of cheap prescription drugs, those are obviously Americans. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in presidential news, somebody leaked Rudy Giuliani's entire 140-page campaign plan to the press. Giuliani is calling it a dirty trick. He said it was stolen while he was in Florida, which is not the first time a presidential race has been stolen in Florida.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll that is just out has Hillary Clinton coming in fourth among democratic hopefuls in Iowa. Fourth. I don't want to say that's bad news for Hillary, but her new Secret Service code name is NBC. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all our best to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, broke his leg while skiing in Idaho. Arnold tried to act like it didn't hurt, but you know Arnold can't act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Pat Robertson's in the news. Screw-loose Pat Roberston said God told him personally there will be a major terrorist attack affecting millions of people in the United States this year. Yeah. However, today, God denied talking to Robertson. God said whenever Robertson calls he lets the machine get it. So, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Saddam Hussein, you know they hanged the guy a week ago. ... But the people were taunting Saddam Hussein, just like seconds before it's lights out. And, you know, when that happens on this show, we just go to a commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But do you know what his last words were? Did you -- have you read this? I don't know if it's in the papers. It was on the Internet earlier. Seconds before Saddam Hussein was hanged, his last words were, 'They made another Rocky movie?' Honest to God, those were his last words. That's a true story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is being criticized after he announced that he is going to have a two-day inauguration ceremony. It's normally one, and he wants a two-day ceremony. Apparently, yeah, the ceremony is two days long because it takes Arnold two days to say the word 'inauguration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening at the White House -- this is a true story -- President Bush welcomed new members of Congress with what's being referred to as 'a bicameral, bipartisan reception.' Yeah. Or as Bush calls it, 'a bye-bye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first Muslim member of Congress is planning to be sworn in on a copy of the Koran that was once owned by Thomas Jefferson. That's cool, yeah. The congressman says he found Thomas Jefferson's Koran on the shelf next to George Washington's Torah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you very much. Man, you sound like the new Democrats in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a big story. Today, Nancy Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House. They say, yeah, this is the furthest anyone wearing a dress has gotten in Washington since J. Edgar Hoover.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, for all you young girls out there who have been following Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, Nancy Pelosi is what you call a role model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Nancy Pelosi said today, 'We waited 200 years for this.' Two hundred years. How many face-lifts has this woman had?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with 'The Wall Street Journal,' the prime minister of Iraq says not only will he not accept a second term in office, he wishes he could quit early. He says he has other interests he would like to pursue, like trying to stay alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's got to make the troops feel good. The prime minister of Iraq wants to quit? Even the French...didn't give up that quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Bush is expected to announce that he is now sending more troops to Iraq, despite the fact that his generals, the military analysts, members of Congress and most of the American people are against the idea. The reason he's doing this? To give Iraq a government that responds to the will of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? The Iraqi government has ordered an investigation into the abusive behavior toward Saddam Hussein at his execution. The crowd was apparently taunting Hussein. You know, some people just don't know how to behave at a hanging. 'Hey, we're trying to hang a guy here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as you know, Saddam Hussein was hung -- or at least that's what he liked to tell the ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news ? he's now gone to a far worse place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new poll has Hillary Clinton coming in fourth among Democratic hopefuls in Iowa. Fourth, which is not really bad, considering she came in eighth behind other women in their own home, you know, with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia was sworn in for another term in Congress at the age of 90. Yeah. Yeah, Byrd said he's excited to be reelected. He's looking forward to working with President Coolidge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Little controversy -- President Bush is claiming that a new postal law gives him the authority to read anyone's letters without a warrant. Yeah. If you're upset about the law, you can let Bush know by writing to your sister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day -- earlier today, Nancy Pelosi was sworn in as Speaker of the House. Everybody's excited. Yeah, yeah. Experts say Pelosi is now the country's most powerful non-Oprah woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, for the first time in 12 years, the Democrats now control both houses of Congress. Yeah. You know what that means, now that the Democrats are in control? Now, the female pages have to watch out. Whoa! Guess the little boys are safe for a while.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what I loved? Today, Democrats celebrated what they call an 'Open House for the People's House.' That's what they called it. This is where Democrats honor the common man. Of course, it's invitation only. You had to know somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we have a new person in the mailroom opening mail. President Bush. You know about this? President now says the government has the right to open anyone's mail at any time without a warrant. How crazy is that? Huh? President Bush finally decides he wants to read something, and it's our mail. How about those memos on the desk? Why don't you check those out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Open mail? I'd be happy if the government could just deliver mail. Try that first. Then open mail afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that kind of frightening? He has the right to open anybody's mail at any time. In fact, today, in a huge coincidence, President Bush announced he is the winner of the Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. Yeah, he gets $10 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential experts say Hillary Clinton will soon form a presidential exploratory committee. Actually, that is not new. She's formed presidential exploratory committees before -- every time she tried to find her husband. 'I know he's in here! Look over there! Open that closet!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's some talk in Democratic circles that with Barack Obama becoming so popular that Hillary Clinton is considering him for her vice presidential running mate. Yeah. To give you an idea how popular Obama is now, he's considering Hillary as his vice presidential running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the price of oil has dropped to under $59 a barrel. How about that, huh? In fact, you know -- you know the effect this is going to have on the price of gasoline? Nothing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, in one week, oil corporation profits dropped from obscene to just indecent. So there you go right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Japanese government report has concluded Japan could make a nuclear weapon in three to five years. The report also concluded the Japanese nuclear weapon would be similar to the American weapon, but smaller and more fuel-efficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Saddam Hussein? Hoo! You know what I mean? It just goes to show you, you start killing people by the hundreds of thousands, pretty soon it's going to catch up with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about ? oh, I know we're excited about football over here...the Jets are going to be in the playoffs. It's remarkable. Everybody in New York City has Jets fever. As a matter of fact, earlier today, Hillary Clinton was wearing her green-and-white pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this. The United States Army is lowering its standards for education ? lowering its standards for education and DUI arrests. That's right. They're trying to recruit ? well, it's the same way they filled the job of commander-in-chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see about this? Dick Cheney got a big pay raise. So I'm now not the only screw-up whose overpaid, so that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, hard at work, very hard at work right now. Yesterday, President Bush announces that his nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is a State Department official named Zalmay Khalilzad. Yeah. Or as President Bush calls him, 'Hey, buddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, yesterday, after being sworn in for his 9th term, 90-year-old -- 90-year-old Senator Robert Byrd shouted, 'Praise, Jesus!' In response, Jesus said, 'See you in about 20 minutes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why they want to raise the minimum wage. They get a wage, give us the minimum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what's going on here. I mean, the game's at 8:30. They have to take the whole day off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has moved out National Intelligence Director John Negroponte and appointed Mike McConnell. Negroponte said he didn't see the move coming, which might explain why he's no longer head of intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, an Iraqi judge officially dropped all remaining charges against Saddam Hussein. That's nice. You don't want to leave a guy hanging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the prime minister of Iraq said he would like to step down. I guess it didn't turn out to be the dream job he thought it would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, they have a special ceremony in Iraq when one of their leaders leaves office. I think it's called a funeral, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, oil prices dropped 10%, while the price of gas rose 2%. How does that work? See, it's supply and demand. The oil company has the supply, and they demand all our money. That's how it works. It's all supply and demand.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, oil industry analysts predict the price of gas could go back to $3 a gallon by February 14th. Huh, how about that? So one way or another, you're gonna get screwed on Valentine's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while in Mexico promoting his movie 'Rocky Balboa,' Sylvester Stallone has criticized and spoken out against U.S. plans to build a fence along the border. The government has not commented yet. Of course, they're still waiting to here what Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal have to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this weather? Isn't the weather crazy, though? This is the warmest January in the history of records ? weather-keeping records ? weather, you know? Warmest January in the history of records. As a matter of fact, another chunk actually broke off Condoleezza Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a new plan that would give everyone in California health insurance. Good for them. Yeah, everybody in -- everybody in California. Not surprisingly, it will be paid for by Blue Cross of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. It's been reported that Rudolph Giuliani has trademarked the name 'Rudolph Giuliani' so other candidates can't use his name in negative campaign ads. They can't use -- if they want to do a negative campaign ad, they can't say his name. Yeah. For similar reasons, Hillary Clinton has trademarked the words 'ball buster,' 'castrator' and 'nut cruncher.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was a pretty big year for Florida. They won the NCAA basketball championship and now the BCS football championship. I guess the only thing Florida didn't score well in ? ballot counting.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how big the game was last night, you know, Congress actually took the day off yesterday so they could watch the game. Now back east, the game didn't even start until 8:30. Congress took the whole day off to prepare to watch the game. Well, that should end the rumors that the Democrats don't have their priorities in order, huh, yeah? Nice to see it's not business as usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush will go on national TV tomorrow night to announce his new plan for Iraq, which means he's got about 18 hours to come up with something, so we'll see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually -- yeah. President Bush is calling his new plan for Iraq 'the new way forward.' Don't confuse that with the old plan. That was called 'wingin' it.' Yeah, that didn't -- apparently, that one didn't work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats say they will harshly scrutinize any new plan by President Bush, unless, of course, there's a big college football game that day. Then, you know -- then, all bets are off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' there's been more than a 50% increase in orders for giant yachts 90 feet or longer. President Bush said, 'This is proof the tax cuts are working. They're providing job for literally dozens of yacht builders.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Pennsylvania yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney went duck hunting at a private club. See, the way it works is, when he hunts, everybody ducks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Features Of George Bush's New Iraq Plan: &quot;10. Make the war best two-out-of-three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Blame it on that crazy New York gas leak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Convene blue-ribbon study group; ignore recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Consult with Rumsfeld, who's now working as a casino greeter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Sit on ass until January 2009; let Hillary figure it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Send Cheney to Baghdad with a shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tax cuts for the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Put Giants coach Tom Coughlin in charge of enemy, watch them collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Raise money for escalation by robbing Mick Jagger's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dig up Saddam and execute him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush will address the nation tomorrow night, and his speech is going to preempt the television show 'Deal or no Deal.' Yeah. To appease fans of the show, the President will hide his Iraq strategy in one of 26 suitcases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Al Sharpton is, I guess, getting involved in politics more thoroughly. Yesterday, Al Sharpton was asked about running for president, and he said -- this is an exact quote ? 'I'm not hearing a lot of meat. When the meat hits the fire, we'll find out if there's some real meat there.' Firstly, I think it's a shame President Bush can't run again because that would be one hell of a debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police -- this is a true story. Police in North Carolina arrested a 26-year-old man for hiding marijuana in his Barbie backpack. Yeah, it's true. The man's parents say that the marijuana is the second most embarrassing thing they've heard today.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, earlier tonight -- in fact, right as we're speaking, President Bush announced he is creating 20,000 new jobs. They were all in Iraq, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, as you know -- you probably heard about this. President Bush said he's ordering a surge in troops in Iraq. You know, the last time the President had a surge he got impeached, didn't he? Oh, that was an urge. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this -- I guess President Bush wants to send in 20,000 more troops to Iraq because he believes it will stop the fighting. Stop the fighting in Iraq? We can't even stop the fighting between Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. submarine, the Newport News, collided with a Japanese oil tanker in the Straits of Hormuz. When he heard about it, President Bush immediately called and asked if the oil was okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of oil, the price of oil continues to fall. It's now dropped below $54 a barrel. Got that? $54 a barrel. So, if oil is less than $54 a barrel, why did it cost me $62 to fill up my car this morning, huh? I know I'm not using the whole barrel, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard, now, the government can now go through your mail, open your mail at any time without a warrant. You know, I had an idea this happened when I got this in the mail. You probably got one. See, it says 'you may already be a winner.' See, look in the corner, it says -- see, 'I checked, you're not, President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The Washington Post' reporting that John Kerry is hiring staff and preparing another run for the White House. He's telling people he will not make the same mistakes again. This time, all new mistakes, so don't worry about that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for universal health care coverage for all Californians. He came up with this idea while falling down the hill in Idaho, breaking his leg. Nothing like a week of dealing with your HMO to convince you need universal health care coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, ladies and gentlemen, there was a big policy address from President Bush about the war in Iraq, and President Bush revealed his new strategy for that war. So, ladies and gentlemen, time to dust off the old 'mission accomplished' banner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush announced his plan for phased withdrawal of Rosie O'Donnell from 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, earlier tonight, President Bush addressed the nation about his new Iraq plan in a live speech broadcast from the White House library. Yeah, he gave it in the White House library. Or as President Bush calls it, 'my books on tape room.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush called Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to congratulate him on his election. That was nice. The phone call got off to an awkward start when Bush told Ortega that he loved his taco shells.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger in the news. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, I love saying that, gave a speech yesterday. When he -- and in his speech, he said he wanted to spend billions of dollars rebuilding California's infrastructure. That's right. Apparently, everyone thought it was a great speech, except for that 45-minute part where Arnold tried to say 'infrastructure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain in the news. Britain announced today that they're working on plans to send the first British person to the moon. Yeah. British -- British officials say they've already chosen an astronaut, now they just need to figure out how to dehydrate meat pudding.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was nothing but reruns on TV last night. But enough about President Bush's speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the good news last night, President Bush finally admitted he made some mistakes in Iraq. The bad news, he's planning on making the same mistakes again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is now calling for sending 21,000 more troops to Iraq. How does he come up with that number? I don't think there's 21,000 people in the country that even think that's good idea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all watch this? Remember the good old days when we were in Iraq to steal the oil? What happened to that? We were there for a purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of that, President Bush says his new plan ensures that every Iraqi citizen gets a piece of the oil revenue, and then Dick Cheney had another heart attack. 'No!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot people saying that last night during the speech in the White House library, that President Bush looked lost and confused. Well, sure, he was in a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I did notice something odd. Did you see any of the books in the library? As he was -- Ellen, run some of the speech last night. Ellen, can we go in tight on some of the books? See look. See that? 'Horton Here's An Insurgent.' There's that one. Go to another one. What is that other one? 'Iraq For Dummies.' There you go. What is ? what's that last one there? 'Dick Cheney's Gay Daughter's Baby Has Two Mommies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said that all the military commanders who have looked at his plan say it will work. That's because all the ones that said it wouldn't work aren't military commanders anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some good news, the President's father, a former President Bush, George Bush Sr., whatever, recovering so well from his hip replacement surgery, he's going to jump out of an airplane again on his 85th birthday. Isn't that unbelievable? He doesn't want to jump, it's just we're so short on troops, he's been called back. We're just running out of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state of New Jersey is now considering rewriting its constitution to eliminate a 150-year-old law that would prevent idiots from voting. Why would you want to eliminate that? We should make it -- all states should keep idiots from voting. Don't you think? And while you're at it, keep them from running for office, too. Can we put that in there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a pizza chain in Dallas announced they're going to start accepting Mexican pesos. Whose idea is that? You know, most fast food employees can't make change in American money. Okay? Now they got to figure out the exchange rate. How long is that going to take?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the pizza chain is called Little Caesar Chavez Pizza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 2006 has been declared the hottest year on record. And today, Al Gore went, 'Yes! I mean, oh, that's awful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And NBA star Jason Kidd has filed for divorce, complaining that his wife beat him up. He said his wife is jealous, paranoid, insults him, thinks he's cheating and throws household objects at him. Or as Bill and Hillary call that, Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, Bill O'Reilly and Stephen Colbert will appear on each other's programs. Colbert is the pseudo-journalist who makes a mockery of TV news ? I'm sorry, that's Bill O'Reilly. I get them confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks see President Bush on television last night? Yeah... Well, he took responsibility for the mistakes in Iraq and he also took responsibility for the collapse of the New York Giants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people who watched the speech said that President Bush looked uncomfortable, and I was thinking, looked uncomfortable? Of course, he's in a library surrounded by books! By books! Of course he's going to look uncomfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the solution. It's the big surge. Bush is going to send more troops to Iraq. That's the solution. Going to send more troops to Iraq. And I was thinking, you think he'd be doing this if he was still in the National Guard?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave a big speech last night. That was big, yeah. In a prime time speech last night, President Bush said that he was sending in 20,000 troops to end the war. That's right. He wasn't talking about Iraq. He was talking about the war between Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, after hearing the President's speech, Democrats in the Senate are seeking bipartisan support for a non-binding resolution opposing President Bush's deployment of his military escalation. In response, President Bush said, 'Huh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, there's actually ice on the ground here in Los Angeles? Ice. Man, people are slipping more than President Bush's approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course today, Martin Luther King Day, the day we celebrate that remarkable life of the civil rights pioneer. You know what's amazing, just -- they were showing clips all throughout the day. And man, that man could give a speech, couldn't he? I mean, he could really move you with his words. See, we don't have that anymore. Now, we have, like, Arnold and President Bush, you know? When they speak, people reach for the dictionary. 'What was that? Nucular? What's that? What's nucular?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, NBC -- on NBC was this show '1 vs. 100.' No, not the game show, President Bush trying to sell his Iraqi war plan; it was '1 vs. 100.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush has called on Iraq for a better performance by their government. And today, Iraq said, 'You first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush's new plan is called the way forward. Now don't confuse that with the previous President, Bill Clinton. He had a similar policy. His was called way too forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of Democrats and Republicans actually are coming out against Bush's plan for Iraq. It's nice to see Democrats and Republicans on the same page, you know? Especially when it's not a congressional page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush says that his new plan ensures that every Iraqi citizen gets a piece of the oil business. As opposed to here, where the oil business gets a piece of every U.S. citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Saddam Hussein's half-brother and former head of Iraq's Revolutionary Court were hanged this morning before dawn. They were hanged. Well, sources said it took an extra two weeks after Saddam's execution, because they had to work out the deal with YouTube.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, has announced he is running for president. Oh, there you go. There you go. Well, Dodd said over the past few weeks he's been having a conversation with the mirror about running. The bad news? Today, the guy in the mirror came out in favor of Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the New Orleans Saints...beat the Philadelphia Eagles 27-24 on Saturday. And once again, New Orleans did it without any help from FEMA. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this is the first time people in New Orleans have ever stood and cheered for a guy named Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Just like Britney -- no underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God, earlier today ladies and gentlemen, Saddam Hussein's brother was executed. You remember Saddam Hussein, he has three brothers. There is Saddam, there is Barzan and little Joe is the third brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you folks were laughing at that last joke, President Bush admitted to five more mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Bush last night on '60 Minutes'? Bush said we are in an ideological struggle with evildoers. Ideological struggle with evildoers. I think he is talking about the Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush admitted to making mistakes in Iraq and said that he has learned from these mistakes and will do better in Iran. So -- I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the interview President Bush said that popularity is not his goal. Popularity is not his goal. And I thought well, mission accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, Barack Obama threw his hat in the ring, and then put it back on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Hillary Clinton is on her way back from a fact-finding tour of Iraq. She said although there are many problems in Iraq, she said there are good things about the Iraqi people also. Like the fact that they hang adulterers! She seemed excited about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study, Americans' attitudes towards overweight people are changing. They say the overwhelming majority of Americans are now more accepting of heavier body types. Do you know what that means? Bill Clinton was a man ahead of his time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, of course, 'American Idol.' But enough about Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Barack Obama has jumped into the presidential race. Experts say this will make things tough for Hillary Clinton, because, you know, he's against the war in Iraq and, of course, she voted for it. And today, I thought this was nice. Bill Clinton told Hillary, 'If it would help' -- he said if it would help, you know, he could get her some sympathy, you know, by cheating on her again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was hoping Barack Obama would announce when he was on our show. But he's waiting for Oprah. ... That's the big rumor. That Barack will officially announce on the 'Oprah' show. I think Hillary will announce on 'Trading Spouses.' And, of course, John Kerry will announce on 'The Biggest Loser,' so between the three of them, it will be pretty exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democrats have also announced that their 2008 presidential convention will be in Denver. Denver will be where the Democrats will be meeting. You know, it's interesting. The Republicans really haven't made a big deal about where their 2008 convention will be. They're keeping it very low key. See, they're afraid President Bush will find out where it is and show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Spanish newspapers are reporting that Fidel Castro in very grave condition, very ill health. In fact, the -- his priest told him yesterday he will soon be in a better place. And Castro said, 'I'm going to Miami? Wow.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting, I understand it was Castro's wish that he be buried at sea, but unfortunately all of the rafts are currently in use in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is big story for the military. It seems an Air Force staff sergeant who posed naked for 'Playboy' magazine has been discharged from the military. The Air Force said she does not meet the high standards they set and she has not conformed to the core values of excellence in everything they do. So obviously, these guys haven't seen the pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of football, there was talk that the coach of the San Diego Chargers, Marty Schottenheimer -- I think I said that right. They said he could be fired. Looks like he's going to stay; we just got that in, right, a couple -- a few minutes ago. He's going to stay. You know, his team was upset by the New England Patriots, making that miss the sixth playoff game in a row that he lost. But the thing is, he's got a pretty good record, I understand. A pretty good record, but his reputation is he can't win the big one, no matter how weak the opponent is. You know, kind of like the Democratic presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear about this? Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are now planning to move to New Orleans. They want to escape all the media attention in Hollywood. I don't know, you think the press will leave them alone with their new home, anyone? I know FEMA will ignore them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting ready for the State of the Union address. President Bush is going to be talking about global warming in his State of the Union address. He's unveiling his new plan. I believe it's called No Icecap Left Behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard about this. I was surprised. President Bush has the answer to global warming. He's going to mention it in the State of the Union speech. He's going to send 20,000 troops to the sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, did you hear about this, President Bush watched the hanging of Saddam Hussein. He said he was not pleased how the Iraqis executed Saddam Hussein. And the Iraqis are getting their nose out of joint. They're a little snippy, and they fired back with, 'Yeah, we're not pleased with how you executed the war.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, you believe the numbers all across the country: 25 in L.A.; 15 in New York; minus 5 in Washington. And that's just President Bush's approval rating. Boy, that's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man. Have you been watching 'American Idol'? Let me ask you something. When did it turn into 'America Junior High School'? What is that? You know, where they're nice to the pretty people and make fun of the nerds. Doesn't that just seem meaner to you this year, huh? Even al Qaeda is going, 'Hey, why so mean?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, President Bush expected, for the first time next week, in the State of the Union address, to talk about global warming. He doesn't want to, but it's either that or talk about Iraq, okay. And believe me, right now global warming's looking pretty good to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, President Bush has great timing, doesn't he? The nation's never been more open to hear about global warming than in the middle of a deep freeze in January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Hillary Clinton is back from her fact-finding tour of Iraq. She had to cut the trip short to address a growing threat here at home, Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said today that politics have become too gummed up by money and influence. Then he had to leave to attend a fundraiser.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the U.S. Border Patrol has discovered a tunnel that went from a house in Nogales, Arizona, all the way under the Mexican border into Mexico. Border agents first got suspicious when they noticed every morning, 300 Wal-Mart employees would leave the house and go to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The word out of Cuba, Fidel Castro's health is worsening after three unsuccessful surgeries. According to reports, one operation removed nearly two feet of his intestines. Two feet of intestine. Imagine that. And then, three Cuban guys tied it in a circle and tried to float it to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, American attitudes about overweight people are changing. We are becoming more accepting of fat people. You know why? Because we are fat people now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It actually snowed in Malibu earlier today, in Malibu. It's a tough time to be living in Malibu now. You have to shovel a path to your burning house. It's awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, President Bush is going to do something about global warming. He became alarmed when another chunk of ice fell off his mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush has a plan to fight global warming. He's going to reinstate Pluto.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Yeah, then he added, 'Oh, and we could also use some light bulbs and $400 billion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff is on trial for perjury.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess you all heard by now, there was snow in Barbra Streisand's hometown of Malibu yesterday, huh? When President Bush heard about it, he said, 'What's happened? Hell has frozen over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, they have no experience with snow in Malibu. It took forever to remove it. You know why? They tried to get rid of it by breaking it up with razor blades. You know, they were -- but it didn't work. They walked around the street ? they were just, they were very confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy TGIF. You know what that means in California? The grapefruit is 50 bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Governor Schwarzenegger was out inspecting the damage to the food crop yesterday from the cold. They showed him on the news with one farmer who cut open an orange and showed it to Arnold. And Arnold looked at it and said, 'Yeah, that is an orange. You are correct.' He thought it was a test for something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold Michael Vick's snow cone got confiscated. Did you know that? He had a snow cone with a hollowed-out center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story. Atlanta Falcon quarterback Michael Vick being investigated after security at Miami Airport confiscated a water bottle he was carrying that had a secret compartment in it that contained what appeared to be marijuana. ... Well, did you hear his excuse? They asked him, 'Did anyone else touch your bags?' He said, 'Ricky Williams.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in her first press conference after her trip overseas, Hillary Clinton said she thinks we may need to send more men to Afghanistan. The men she wants to send -- John Edwards and Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the Scooter Libby trial, the defense is looking for people for the jury who trust Dick Cheney. Well, actually, most of the people who trusted Dick Cheney have also been indicted. So that's a little tricky there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in this month's 'Details' magazine, John Kerry says that he loves cookies so much, he thinks he is the illegitimate son of the cookie monster. Really? Looks more like the illegitimate son of Herman Munster. Doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's still a lot of criticism of the Saddam Hussein hanging. You know, the way I look at it, Saddam died doing what he loved, attending an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know ? Saddam's lawyer was speaking out again today. And he said he has never seen judges so cruel, cold and unsympathetic, and he was talking about 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, for the second time this year, 'Grey's Anatomy' star Isaiah Washington is in trouble with the gay community for making anti-gay slurs. So right about now, he should be an alcoholic and going into rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a bill in the California State Legislature now to ban spanking, which is good news for the kids, bad news for the porn industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a research group is now accusing Wal-Mart of fraudulently advertising food in their stores as organic. The first clue the food was not organic ? it's at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think there's anything natural at Wal-Mart? Even the employees are not naturalized at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. The American Dialect Society has chosen the word 'plutoed' as 2006 word of the year. To be 'plutoed' means to be demoted of value. Like what happened to the planet Pluto. Remember? Remember, Pluto's not really a planet anymore so it got plutoed. Which I think it's bad to get plutoed. Though to be honest, I'd much rather be plutoed than uranused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, big weekend in Baghdad. The Shiites are offering a special hang one, get one free. Be there for that.&quot; David Letterman: &quot;Earlier in the week they hung one of Saddam Hussein's brothers. You know, he's one of three brothers. There was Saddam, there was Barzan, and the third one was little Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, wait a minute. No, it was Saddam, it was Barzan, and the third one was Schemp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muslim-American groups are angry over the way Muslims are portrayed on the new season of the fox drama, '24.' Yeah. Yeah, a spokesman for Fox said, 'If Muslims are upset about that they should see how they're portrayed on Fox News.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Reverend Jesse Jackson told CNN that he's planning to endorse Barack Obama for president. Yeah, experts -- experts say this is a risky move for Jackson because hardly anything rhymes with Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Cambodia, a woman was found who lived alone in the jungle for 20 years and who speaks an unintelligible language. They don't know what she's saying, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' What a crowd. Yeah. Yeah, thank you very much. You sound like Republicans when they heard Hillary was running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's official. Hillary Clinton is running for President of the United States. She said on her website, 'I'm in it to win.' That's what she announced, 'I'm in it to win.' That may seem obvious, but for Democrats running for president, they lost so many times, they have to keep reminding themselves why they're in the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Hillary says she has gotten hundred of calls telling her to go on the road and campaign for the next two years. And that's just from her husband Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also running for president, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico. And he should do really well when you realize, every day, we get thousands of new Mexicans. So that should help. I think that will really -- that should help him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also running, Kansas Senator Sam Brownback. He announced he is running for president. He said he is running, and this is his quote, 'He is on the yellow brick road to the White House.' That's what he said, the yellow brick road to the White House. Hey Sam, watch out for the wicked witch of New York, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chicago Bears going to the Super Bowl. How about that? That was kind of -- that was a little lopsided. What, 39-14? Oh, man. The Bears treated New Orleans worse than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulation to the Indianapolis Colts. They're on their way to the Super Bowl, too. They beat the New England Patriots. 38-34; very exciting game. New England was this close to winning, and then they let it slip away. So John Kerry, you are not alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush spent the weekend working on tomorrow night's State of the Union apology -- address -- address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, this morning, presidential candidate Tom Vilsack, he delivered -- he's running for president, too. Tom Vilsack. Anyway, he delivered a prebuttle to President Bush's State of the Union address, a prebuttle, that's what they call that. I know it sounds like something you get at a proctologist, but no, this is a -- a prebuttle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the Democrats think they know what President Bush is going to say before he says it, and the Republicans think people understand what he said after he said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President's daughter, Jenna Bush, is reportedly trying to get a book deal to write about her life in the White House. President Bush is very upset about it, yeah. Not about what she'll write, he's just worried, 'Oh, I'll have to read another book. It's a nightmare.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell warned baseball owners that if they don't cooperate with his investigation into steroid use, it will significantly increase the chances of government involvement in baseball. Huh? You think the game of baseball is slow now. Wait 'til the government gets involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you know about this? There's a bill in the California Legislature to ban spanking, which would make California the first state to prohibit parents from spanking their children, which could really change the way parents discipline their kids. 'Tommy, if you don't turn off the TV and do your homework, I'm going to put you in the car, drive you to Nevada and spank you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While you folks were applauding, three more Democrats announced they were running for president. A total now of eight people have announced that they want to be president. Eight people now want to be president. It's George Bush's fault. He has lowered the standard. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourself, ladies and gentlemen, politics is a dirty business and Hillary Clinton announced she is running for president. The Republicans are already busy digging up dirt and they found out that once, in her lifetime, she slept with Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush gave his State of the Union speech earlier tonight, or as they call that on ABC, 'Dancing with the Issues.' I believe that was the name of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Do you know the Constitution does not specify how long the State of the Union address must be? You know who gave the longest State of the Union address ever? Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton. You know who gave the shortest? George Washington, just a couple of minutes. Well, sure, when a politician can't tell a lie, it limits how much they can say, you see.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Hillary Clinton announced she's running for President of the United States, which isn't a surprise to many people, except maybe those who just voted for her for a second term as senator. Well, she put in a good, solid 20 days before she decided to do something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? In a series of TV interviews this morning, Hillary Clinton said her favorite movie as a little girl was 'Wizard of Oz,' her favorite movie in college was 'Casablanca,' and then after she got married, her favorite movie ? 'Kill Bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Democrats have a lot of choices. Think about it. Hillary would be the first woman president. Bill Richardson would be the first Hispanic president. Barack Obama would be the first African-American president. And Dennis Kucinich would be the first hobbit president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Kansas, Senator Sam Brownback also announced he is running for president. You know, a lot of people are not familiar with Brownback. In fact, his campaign slogan is, 'almost as well-known as Tom Vilsack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you hear about this? Did you hear about this? Former President Walter -- Vice President, rather -- Walter Mondale has criticized Vice President Dick Cheney's role in the White House during a speech, saying Cheney has stepped over the line. Yeah. And, of course, people were stunned when they heard this. They went, 'What? Walter Mondale is still alive? We had no idea.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and beginning today -- beginning today, citizens of the United States will be required to show passports when re-entering the country from Mexico. Mexican citizens, of course, will still be allowed to use the hole in the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is now a bill in the California legislature to ban spanking. Ban spankings. And ironically -- ironically, you know what the punishment is for first-time offenders? Slap on the wrist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's a new law being proposed in New Jersey that would make it illegal to smoke in a car if you have children with you. Is that going to protect kids? Think about this. I mean, they're not breathing the smoke in the car, they're going to be breathing the air in New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear about this? A guy what kicked off a flight for wearing an anti-Bush T-shirt; the guy had an anti-Bush T-shirt on him, big slogan on there. And when he refused to take off the shirt or change the shirt, they kicked him off the plane. Yeah. Here's the scary part -- turns out the guy was a pilot on Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And another Cincinnati Bengals player, cornerback Johnathan Joseph, has been arrested for possession of marijuana. And today Michael Vick said, 'That's where my dope went. I knew it was -- I knew it was here somewhere. I thought it was in my bottle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story -- the Academy Award nominations were announced earlier today. Al Gore's movie 'An Inconvenient Truth,' up for best documentary. The bad news for Al -- the votes will be counted in Broward County, Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new Harvard School of Public Health report -- listen to this. Transfat -- transfat can actually cause a woman to become infertile. So, guys, the next time you forget the condom, just buy her a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. 'Here, eat that!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In George W. Bush's State Of The Union Address: &quot;10. Wore a 'Hillary in 2008' T-shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Unveiled plan for botched invasion of Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Vowed to end America's dependence on foreign films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 20-minute presentation on why 'The O.C.' shouldn't be canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. More than once, he turned and kissed Nancy Pelosi on the mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. When he said 'Times are tough. That's why when I need a little pick-me-up I reach for a Snickers!' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Concluded policy proposal with a rousing 'Deal or No Deal?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Announced intelligence reports suggest there is a veal shank under the pantsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For viewers who have HDTV, he was 17% Bushier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Showed up late explaining he was watching 'Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened earlier tonight, ladies and gentlemen, down in Washington, DC, the annual State of the Union Address. ... The annual State of the Union address. And oh, man, Bush received a subdued reception, you know, kind of like you gave me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the speech, I saw it, it was so dull, behind President Bush, Nancy Pelosi and Dick Cheney were making out. Honest -- my hand to God, they were back there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Academy Award nominations earlier today. You folks excited about the Academy ? I'll bet you are. ... How about that Al Gore movie? That received two nominations. And out of habit, Al demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush gave his State of the Union address last night. Or as the Democrats are calling it, 'Babel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would say Bush got a cold reception from the Democratically-controlled Congress. I think Saddam got a warmer reception at his hanging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That room was so cold last night, Hillary was comfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was tough out there for President Bush. He was sweating more than Isaiah Washington at a gay pride parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the White House staff rewrote President Bush's speech last night over 30 times -- rewrote it over 30 times --- until finally they told the President, 'Look, we can't make the words any smaller. Some of them have two or three syllables. You have to try the three-syllable words.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush pointed out that unemployment is low and inflation is low. Unfortunately, not as low as his popularity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I give President Bush credit, though. He addressed the problems troubling Americans. The war in Iraq, the economy, the need to develop alternative fuel. He seemed to know what we were thinking. It's almost as if he was reading our mail or listening to our phone calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Hillary? Did you see Hillary sitting there? Yeah, I don't want to say she wasn't buying Bush's speech, but she had that look on her face like she gets when Bill is telling her where he was all night. 'Yeah. What am I, an idiot? Yeah, okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, you know Hillary Clinton is running for President of the United States. Hillary says she plans to run as a mother, which has some Democrats concerned that they would be perceived as the 'Mommy Party.' As opposed to last time when Bill was president, when they were perceived as the 'Who's Your Daddy? Party.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Kerry announced today, he will not run for president in 2008. Finally, a politician that listens to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, just moments ago, John Kerry released his supporter, yeah, so, he's free to go elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, first he was ? that's typical John Kerry. He ran for president. Now he's against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore's documentary, 'An Inconvenient Truth,' about global warming, nominated for two Academy Awards. But a lot of people expect him to get another Oscar nomination for best special effects. Did you see the movie? Did you see it? They made Al Gore look so lifelike. I could not believe -- I was stunned. He's actually moving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I think Al Gore really wants to win. He's very competitive. Like today -- did you hear about this? He accused 'Little Miss Sunshine' of causing global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as part of a nationwide immigration raid, officials caught 761 illegals here in Los Angeles. Hundreds were deported. And it was kind of sad. You know what their final words were, to their friends and family leaving LA? 'See you next week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways George W. Bush Can Boost His Popularity: &quot;10. Hang Saddam again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Improve focus by removing Playstation 3 from Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Develop steamy 'Will they or won't they?' relationship with Nancy Pelosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Make people believe there's a waffle shortage; then when people see waffles in the supermarket, he'll be a hero!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Turn weekly radio address into wacky morning zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Redecorate Oval Office to look like the set of 'The View'-- people love 'The View'!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Convene blue ribbon panel to find out what the hell is wrong with Paula Abdul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nail a heavyset intern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Deploy 20,000 troops to put underpants on Britney Spears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that John Kerry? You know, last time around he ran for president. John Kerry has announced he will not be running for president in 2008. So that means the Democrats are just going to have to find another way to blow the election. That's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry not running. Now I'm the only national figure botching jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you folks have Oscar fever? You know, the Al Gore documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth,' do you know about that one? Nominated for two Academy Awards. One Academy Award was best song. Honest to God, it's about the temperature of the Earth heating up and exploding. It's nominated for best song. I think they deserve an award just for being able to find something that rhymes with ethanol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, Al Gore, speaking of Al Gore, today he confronted another inconvenient truth. He's morbidly obese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks saw the Bush State of the Union address last night? I can still hear the echoes of meaningless standing ovations, can't you? I wish I could get a standing ovation every time I said universal health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the breakdown on the speech last night. During the speech, President Bush said al Qaeda ten times, referred to al Qaeda ten times, mentioned Iraq 14 times, and this is kind of a surprise. He said mesquite 43 times. Isn't that odd?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush then asked for support for our uniformed boys in harm's way. And of course he was talking about congressional pages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this is kind of shocking. President Bush now has the lowest presidential approval rating since President Nixon. Now here's another coincidence. Nixon had a dog named Checkers. Bush plays checkers with his dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you. You're just happy to see somebody who's not running for president. That's all it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now Senator John Kerry announced yesterday he will not run for president in 2008. Now he says -- he said the time is just not right. You know why it is not the right time? It is an election year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he said he wants to spend more time concentrating on his career in comedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush began his State of the Union address the other night by saying, 'I have the high privilege and distinct honor to begin a speech by saying 'Madame Speaker.' That's what he said. Although -- although, Bill Clinton was the first President to utter the words 'I want to speak to the madam.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is being criticized for not mentioning New Orleans in his speech the other night. And today, the President apologized, saying, 'I can't believe I ignored New Orleans again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the second time. President Bush also says he's going to ask Congress for $10 billion more for Afghanistan: $10 billion. You know, I got a solution for the people of New Orleans. Put on turbans, throw rocks at each other, change your name to 'Kabul,' you'll get $10 billion like that. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking about the war, President Bush said the other night, 'This is not the fight we entered in Iraq.' Hey, I still remember the fight he didn't enter in Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, President Bush also told congress, 'Each of us is guided by our own convictions.' And then a Republican says, 'Don't mention convictions, whatever you do! Don't say the word conviction!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Pennsylvania Republican Don Sherwood, he's a congressman and car dealer who lost his House seat last fall after he ran an ad admitting he had a mistress. In his campaign ads, he admitted he had a mistress. He is now refusing to pay her the rest of the half a million dollars he promised her. So let that be a lesson to all young women out there. When you sleep with a member of congress, get your money upfront.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this woman is surprised that he lied. She's surprised he lied? Hey, he's a politician, a car dealer, and a guy, that's the trifecta of lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mentioned this the other night, there is now a bill here in California to ban spanking as a form of punishment. So if you're a teacher in California, spanking your students, you better be having sex with them, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Pfizer, the company that makes the anti-depression drug Zoloft has announced they're laying off 10,000 workers because sales are slow. See that shows you how these companies think. They lay off 10,000 people. Those 10,000 people are now depressed. They take Zoloft, sales go up, you got less workers to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a very odd story. In Florida, a duck that was shot by a duck hunter is doing fine after the hunter found it still alive in his refrigerator two days later. You hear about this story? This guy shoots a duck, puts in his refrigerator. Two days later, opens the door, hears a 'quack.' And today, a worried Dick Cheney checked his deep freezer to see if any lawyer's still in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is now in Iraq. She made a surprise visit to Iraq. Well, you thought Bush wanted to bomb the place before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, she didn't say how long she was staying in Iraq. And President Bush said he was against setting any timetables for Pelosi to return.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said to bring her back prematurely would send the wrong message. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, our troops were thrilled to find out that the surprise guest was Nancy Pelosi. They've been thinking all about Carmen Electra and Pamela Anderson. Yeah, whew!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush now says he wants more money for the reconstruction of Iraq. How come the only place where Republicans think government programs can help people is in Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his State of the Union address, President Bush did say that our economy is on the move. It's moving to India, but hey, it's moving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney lashed out at Hillary Clinton the other day. He said on CNN he doesn't believe Hillary would be a good president. Ooh. Well, he can understand that. I mean, his Administration has raised the bar so high, how can anybody -- how could you measure up, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, the big question that political experts are now asking is what role will Bill Clinton play in Hillary's campaign? I'm guessing the cheating husband?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and John Kerry has announced he will not run for president in 2008, but -- but he has not ruled out losing in 2012. So I would not ? I would not jump the gun on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards -- you know, the man who always says, 'There are two Americas,' 'There are two Americas,' -- moving into a brand-new $6 million, 28,000 square foot home on 102 acres. Well, I think we know which America he's living in, huh? He can almost see the other America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political experts say that Barack Obama drew record crowds in New Hampshire. Record crowds. Well, sure, it's New Hampshire. They've never seen a black guy before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a special announcement for people watching at home. All 400 people in our audience tonight have announced they're running for President of the United States. Yeah, there you go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Delaware Senator Joe Biden just announced he will officially announce that he's running for president on Wednesday. Why do politicians always announce that they're going to announce? Why don't they just announce? Just announce! Don't announce I'm gonna announce.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know why -- you know why Biden did it? This will give him 48 hours to come up with a supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former governor Mike Huckabee -- you can see that Huckabee juggernaut rolling through the audience. Former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee announced he is running for president. This will give Tom Vilsack a chance to move up the list of unknown candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Hillary Clinton has decided to run for president. She's thrown her hat in the ring, and then Bill threw his ring in the drawer. 'Party, party! Whoo! She's gone for two years! Party!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, the knock against Hillary Clinton running is that she's smart but not electable. That's what the critics say -- smart but not electable. As experts call it, a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, I can't fault her for this. At least she was doing it. Did you see Hillary singing the national anthem? This is awful to do to somebody. You probably saw this tape. I'm not even gonna show it, but she was singing in a crowd. You know, they isolate the mic. And you hear her sing. I don't want to say she's bad, but let's just say it's a good thing Simon Cowell can't vote in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all of the presidential candidates are very busy this weekend. John Edwards traveled over 500 miles, and that was just from his front door to his swimming pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Edwards, who is running for president, being criticized now because the new house he just moved into is, like, the biggest house in North Carolina. It's 28,000 square feet, 102 acres. Is that unbelievable? You know, Edwards became famous for talking about the two Americas. Now both of them actually fit in his backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I understand the whole -- the whole property is gated to keep people out from that other America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a surprise visit to Iraq over the weekend. Actually, the one who was most surprised was Nancy. Bush told her she was going to Cancun. She had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems very early to me, but Hillary Clinton already campaigning hard in Iowa. Did you know about this? She's in Iowa right now. And yesterday was interesting. Yesterday, on a campaign trip, Hillary Clinton suggested that she knows how to deal with evil and bad men like Osama bin Laden because she had to put up with her husband. Yeah, which explains why Hillary wants to look for bin Laden at the nearest Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran is getting involved in Iraq. Officials in Iran say they're planning to open a branch of the Iranian national bank in Baghdad. That's right. Anyone who opens a new account at the Baghdad branch will receive 72 virgins and a toaster.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Kentucky arrested a man who had over 80 pounds of marijuana hidden in his car's tires. Yeah. Yeah, police became suspicious when they saw Snoop Dogg chasing the car for two miles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

They say if you're traveling to Miami, they advise you to leave of extra time. Especially if you're floating in from Cuba. Give a couple extra days to get all that straightened out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby, now on trial ? he's now on trial for perjury. Perjury. Let me ask you a question. If you're on trial for perjury, why do they even bother to make you promise to tell the whole truth, the truth, nothing but the truth, huh? 'Yeah, sure, whatever, yeah, yeah. I promise to.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Joe Biden, who is also running for president, says most US senators are against President Bush's plan for sending troops to Iraq. The senators are against it. Wow. Gee, if only there's something they could do about it. It's not like they're in a position of power or anything. Too bad they can't act on these beliefs. Tough break, tough break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, Hillary Clinton has been in Iowa all week. If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she'll spend her time, of course, in the West Wing, while Bill will be in the East Wing, doing what he used to do in the West Wing, while Hillary was in the East Wing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is anybody really surprised that Hillary is running for president? I'm not surprised. I mean, if you're married to Bill Clinton -- women, wouldn't you want to be able to tap his phone, read his mail and torture him to find out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congress began hearings today on the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. Today? They're just investigating Hurricane Katrina now? See, you know, that's pretty sad when the government's investigation of the government's slow response to Katrina, is slower than the government's response to Katrina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Casino Royale' opened in China over the weekend. This is the very first Bond film ever to play in China. The director and all of the stars were at the opening. And I thought this was nice. The Chinese people all very polite. They acted like they hadn't already seen the pirated version. 'We don't know what's going to happen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush keeping very busy right now. Earlier today in Illinois, President Bush visited a Caterpillar tractor factory, and the workers -- this is true -- the workers let him drive one of the giant tractors. Yeah. And as of right now, the President and tractor are still missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Oh, God. Joe Biden, on the day of announcing his candidacy for President of the United States, he called Barack Obama 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate...bright and clean.' I think we've seen the shortest presidential campaign in history, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No word yet on when Biden will admit himself into rehab.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, he also -- he wasn't -- he attacked all the candidates equally. You know? He also said the Democrats made a mistake the last two times by nominating 'blow-dried candidates.' That's what he called them, 'blow-dried candidates.' Now, I'm no political expert, okay? But maybe a guy with bad hair plugs shouldn't be talking about other people's hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, I guess he's the front-runner, at least in Iowa. I think it's -- John Edwards is the front-runner. He's now being criticized by conservatives for living in a mansion while talking about poverty. As opposed to Republicans, who live in a mansion and talk about a tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what's funny, every time -- every time you turn on the news now, there's Hillary Clinton in another city making another speech. And then they always cut to the reporter who is going down a list of her upcoming appearances. They list her upcoming appearances. And, of course, Bill Clinton loves this, because it's like the Hillary Clinton early warning system. He knows. 'Memphis, yes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The knock on Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate is that she is smart, but not electable. Well, as opposed to George Bush, who is electable, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and hey, how about this? Happy Birthday to Vice President Dick Cheney. He turned 66 years old yesterday. Wow. This reminds me, isn't his annual autopsy coming up pretty soon? Don't they usually do that about this time of year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, we're at that weird stage in the Administration where half the people in the White House staff are on C-SPAN and the other half on Court TV. Have you noticed this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh and Congress began hearings this week on the government response to Katrina. See, I'm confused. Was there a government response to Katrina? Was there anybody? I think people in New Orleans are still waiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran announced today plans to open a bank in Baghdad. I believe it's the Bank of Death to America, is the name of the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called the bank, did I tell you that? Yeah, they denied my credit. Denied my loan. And then they denied the Holocaust. This is not a good bank, I don't think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Omaha, Nebraska, they're opening what they're calling, America's first terror-free gas station. The good news, they will only sell petroleum products from countries who like us and do not support terrorism. The bad news, they only have eight gallons. Unless you get there early, you're pretty screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And donut manufacturers --because of all of the bad publicity recently, donut manufacturers announced they are starting to manufacture healthy donuts. Healthy donuts. Donuts with more natural ingredients and no transfat. Yeah, yeah. Healthy donuts, yeah. It's like gunmakers coming out with bullets that have eight essential vitamins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today on Wall Street, President Bush visited the New York Stock Exchange. That's right, yeah. Yeah, there was an awkward moment when President Bush asked, 'When do I get to meet Dow Jones?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is considering a bill that would ban the sale of incandescent light bulbs. Yeah. Arnold isn't worried about saving energy. He's just tired of trying to say incandescent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barry Bonds is in the news. Yesterday, Barry Bonds' agent said that Bonds could hit as many as 1,000 home runs. Yeah. Then the agent admitted he's on more drugs than Barry Bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Joe Biden announced he's running for president yesterday. And today, he was just running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I'm sure you heard by now. I love these kinds of stories. Just hours after announcing he was running for president, Joe Biden made what many considered were inappropriate comments about Barack Obama. In fact, Joe Biden was forced to fire his campaign manager, Michael Richards.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to believe, but Biden is making the Democrats long for the comedy routines of John Kerry. 'John, tell another joke. Save us!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, what I love is the other candidates' response to Biden's remarks. You know, how like, they showed all the other candidates, Hillary -- and they're all going, 'It was unfortunate.' Then, when the camera turns away, they go, 'Yes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And critics of Venezuela say they've now had a radical lurch towards a dictatorship by a leader with unchecked power. When they told President Bush about this, he said, 'What, Cheney's in Venezuela? What happened?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fidel Castro appeared on Cuban television today, to show that he's still alive. The same thing Joan Rivers does every year at the Oscars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mentioned this last night. In Omaha, Nebraska, they're opening the first-ever terror-free gas station. They're only selling petroleum products from countries that like us and do not support terrorism. But don't worry, the station itself will still be run by foreigners that hate us. Don't worry about that. That won't change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, people are already talking about the '08 presidential race. That's hard to believe, isn't it? It's almost two years away. More than two years. I screwed that up. Anyway, the point is ? it's a long time away. Early to bring it up. But former Clinton adviser Dick Morris said, and this is a quote, he just said this ? 'Hillary Clinton will be the next president, but she'll be the worst president we've ever seen.' That's what he said, yeah. After hearing this -- after hearing this, President Bush said, 'Wait a minute, I'm not finished yet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he is starting a joint energy research project with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Yeah. Actually, the man's name is Rod Benson, but Arnold pronounces it 'Blagojevich!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news -- earlier today, former Vice President Al Gore was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. That's right. Gore is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, Gore is being honored for his work putting both Arabs and Jews to sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, thousands of Mexicans gathered in Mexico City to protest high food prices. And the protest only lasted an hour because everyone had to leave for their jobs in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is predicting the Indianapolis Colts will win the Super Bowl. But not to devalue her opinion, she also predicted the war in Iraq would not go into overtime, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush spoke at the 55th annual National Prayer Breakfast. President Bush said that he has prayed every single day since he took office. Hey, you're not the only one. Join the club!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also went to the New York Stock Exchange this week, and Bush said the salaries of top executives should be based on their success. They should only get paid if they're successful. Hey, if that were true, Congress would have lost money, wouldn't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of money, you hear about this? Exxon -- Exxon, record profits. Over $39 billion this year in profits. $39 billion. Who would have thought you could have benefited by selling gas for 3 bucks a gallon? It's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is a big story. According to a new UN report, the global warming outlook is much worse than originally predicted, which is pretty bad when they originally predicted it would destroy the planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the worst part? Oh, it's gonna be humid, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the report on climate change said that humans are very likely making the Earth warmer. Humans are making the Earth warmer. To which Hillary Clinton said, 'Hey, can't blame me for that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy Groundhog Day. Today was Groundhog Day. Punxsutawney Phil was spotted. In fact, as he was coming out of his hole, he ran into Joe Biden digging a hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton saw her shadow. Turns out it was Barack Obama climbing up in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite story of the week. I love this. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's campaign manager resigned -- resigned after he found out that the mayor was having an affair with his wife 18 months ago. When they say the mayor of San Francisco's really on top of things, boy, they're not kidding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this gets bigger. While that was going on, the mayor has been getting a divorce. He's getting a divorce from his wife, who's a reporter on Fox News, who is pregnant by another man. It has gotten so bad over there, in San Francisco, they're now considering banning all straight marriages. They don't work. They don't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's a happy story. Did you see this on the news? Fourteen and a half pound baby boy just born in Mexico; 14 1/2 pounds. Man! Make that hole in the fence a little wider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To prove that he is still alive, Fidel Castro was seen in a new video. It was broadcast on the most popular website in Cuba, Inner Tube. That's their big one. Many people come across on Inner Tube.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a weird story. This week, at a fashion show -- this is true -- at a fashion show in Rome, a line of dresses were introduced that feature huge pictures of Hillary Clinton's face. Yeah, yeah when he heard this Bill Clinton said, 'Finally, Hillary's face on another woman's body.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems like half the country, now, is running for president. Yeah, everybody keeps throwing their hat in the ring. Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack's staff is handing out boxes of popcorn to promote his presidential campaign. It's his gimmick, yeah. Vilsack says that when people go into the voting booth, they should ask themselves one question ? 'Which candidate gave me the most popcorn?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. The Exxon Mobil Corporation has just posted the largest annual profit of any company in American history -- $39.5 billion. Yeah. In fact, it's worth so much their changing their name from Exxon Mobil to Exxon Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice predicted -- she predicted that the Colts would win. Isn't that unbelievable? A Bush Administration victory announcement that actually came true. That has never happened.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Tony Dungy, the first African-American coach to win the Super Bowl. Very exciting. In fact, as the first African-American, Jesse Jackson called it a groundbreaking moment. Al Sharpton called it a positive step. And Hillary Clinton called it a bad omen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton hard out on the campaign trail. Hillary is expected to attract the woman vote. And, of course, Bill will attract the 'other woman' vote. So between the two of them -- see, they will have the female vote locked up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden, God bless him, still out there trying to make amends for the comments he made about Barack Obama last week. Now he's going too far the other way. Have you heard his new campaign slogan? 'Joe Biden, once you go black, you never go back.' See, I don't think that's gonna work, either. I think that's too far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Vice President Al Gore. Been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Luckily for Gore, Florida does not vote on this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the nation's first openly gay governor, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, has officially filed for divorce. Yeah. He cited irreconcilable differences. Apparently, his wife is a woman. Right there you've got problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. Maytag has recalled 2.3 million dishwashers, and the INS has deported 50 more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in. The UN conference on global warming has been cancelled. Whoo! It's cold, I'm telling you, cold here today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so cold President Bush sent 20,000 troops to Al Roker's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the Indianapolis Colts and the city of Indianapolis, my hometown, and the state of Indiana. The Colts beat the Chicago Bears at the Super Bowl. I thought this was weird. After the game, a confused President Bush phoned the locker room and asked to speak to Janet Jackson. What is -- what does that mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy became the first African-American head coach to win the Super Bowl. And today, President Bush called to congratulate him. Isn't that nice? That was very nice, yeah. Yeah, there was a -- there was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'I also thought you were great in the halftime show.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger is in trouble. Did you hear about this? Arnold Schwarzenegger is in trouble after tapes surfaced of him saying negative things about other Republicans. Yeah. Actually, the Schwarzenegger tapes surfaced last year, but they weren't deciphered until this week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the big story today. 'Houston, we have a problem!' Oh, my God! Whoo! Man, is this something? Did you hear the story about this female astronaut named Lisa Marie Nowak? I think that's what her name is. She flew on the space shuttle Discovery just last year. She's been charged with trying to kidnap and murder another female NASA engineer who was her romantic rival. She put on a wig, attacked the other woman with pepper spray and a BB gun after driving 900 miles from Houston to Orlando, Florida, in diapers so she wouldn't have to stop to pee. Did you hear about this? She drove 900 miles wearing diapers, thus breaking the old record set by Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's unbelievable. And I guess it wasn't even that -- like, the woman told police -- the astronaut, the woman that was arrested -- that she was involved with another NASA astronaut. But it was a more a working relationship, less than a romantic relationship. Or as NASA calls that, an 'unauthorized docking procedure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, never mind. Anyway, she was in court today. And the judge let her go free on bail. On bail? Talk about a flight risk. She's an astronaut. She could leave the planet. She could be on Mars by tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton said this week if she was elected president in 2008, she will bring the troops home. The troops home? She can't even get Bill to go home. Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pastor Ted Haggard -- you remember him? Ted Haggard, the evangelical leader who had the gay relationship for three years with a male prostitute while doing crystal meth? Well, he has emerged from three weeks -- three weeks -- of intensive counseling. He says he is cured. He is now completely heterosexual. Thank God they caught it in time, huh? Whew! He was one of the lucky ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The Denver Post,' after three weeks of intensive counseling, he told the oversight board of his church he is now completely heterosexual. Although I think they caught him. When they said, 'How do you feel?' he said, 'fabulous.' 'Get back in there! Get back in there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. She promises to 'take you out like Pluto.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It sounds crazy, but you could swear Mars is following you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Your were on the 'Maury' episode: 'I Had A Booty Call And Now An Astronaut Is Trying To Kill Me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Her previous attempts to kill you have been postponed due to high winds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. She poisons your Tang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. She says she looks forward to being the first to walk on your lifeless corpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Been getting threatening emails from connie@internationalspacestation.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She keeps stabbing you with a pen that writes upside-down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much! Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen. Are you applauding or just trying to keep your hands warm? Here's how cold it is today. Earlier today, President Bush said, 'See, I fixed global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this? This is pretty exciting. A big love triangle. You know what I'm talking about? This woman astronaut was going to kidnap another woman because they were in love with the same guy, so this woman astronaut drives 900 miles wearing a wig and a diaper. I want to tell you, this is one giant step for man, one giant leap to the nut house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The astronaut drove 900 miles wearing a diaper so she wouldn't have to stop. And I'm thinking, this is amazing. I mean, honest to God. What kind of car gets 900 miles to a tank of gas? That's ? that's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So she goes to the airport, and she was going to kidnap this other woman, but thank God the kidnapping attempt failed. And of course it failed. Let's face it, she's no rocket scientist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big story today. Follow me on this. A female astronaut has been arrested for attacking another astronaut's girlfriend with a BB gun, a mallet and pepper spray after she drove 900 miles wearing a diaper. All true. Yeah. Yeah. After hearing about it, NASA officials said, 'We may need to add a new question to the astronaut entrance exam.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The '08 presidential race heating up. Everyone's throwing their hat in the ring. Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo has announced he's forming a presidential exploratory committee. Yeah, the committee won't be paid for their work, but they will get some sweet, high-paying jobs in the Tancredo Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then I gotta mention this. Ted Haggard, the minister -- remember this guy? The minister who was caught with a gay prostitute? He's just finished a three week sex addiction program. He says he is now -- this is a quote ? 'completely heterosexual.' He's 'completely heterosexual.' Haggard says he will prove he's completely heterosexual by having sex only with men who are completely heterosexual. That's his plan. I think it's a good one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey! Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' Nice to have you here. Well, it's Wednesday, or as our astronauts call it, 'Hump Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, have you been following the story of the female astronaut? You been watching this? You all know the story by now. She drove 900 miles from Houston, Texas, to Orlando, Florida, to confront the woman who was her romantic rival. She drove the whole time wearing a diaper so she didn't have to stop and pee. And let me tell you something, ladies -- nothing turns a man on more than a woman with a full diaper. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact the police said, when they arrested her, the cops said they had not seen a driver wearing a diaper in Florida since yesterday.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite a shock. Of course, since it's Florida and this woman is only 43 years old, she will be tried as a juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, this woman is married and has three children. Wow. You thought the Reverend Ted Haggard and his wife were going to have a tense Valentine's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the other big rehab story. Pastor Ted Haggard -- you remember him? He was the head of the evangelical church there in Denver. Had the big crystal meth and had a three-year relationship with a male prostitute. Well, he's emerged from three weeks of gay rehab and says he is no longer gay. He is no longer gay. At least, that's what he told his roommate in rehab, Isaiah Washington. He said, 'I am no longer gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, you have a three-year relationship with a male prostitute, after three weeks of therapy, you're not gay anymore? I mean, what kind of 'Clockwork Orange' treatment are they using on that guy? What do they give him? Electroshock while playing Broadway musicals? 'I could have danced' -- zap! 'Aah!' 'I could have danced all night' ? 'aah!' That's how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, that's what Haggard says. He is now 100% completely heterosexual. He says he no longer has a gay bone in his body. That's what he said today. How many did he have before?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, more rehab news -- you probably know about the Mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, who had sex with the wife of his campaign manager. Well, he announced he's going into alcohol rehab. How insulting is that to the campaign manager? Not only did he have sex with your wife, he had to be drunk to do it. It's even worse. Isn't that worse?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Gavin Newsom's got a new girlfriend. She is an actress, and she was on one of the TV shows today. She said she has no problems with the Governor's [sic] affairs. Has no problem with it. Clinton called the Mayor, rather, and said, 'She's a keeper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama now trying to quick smoking. You see that? I guess Barack Obama smokes a couple of packs a day. He's trying to quit because he's running for president. He's now chewing the nicotine gum. In fact, today, on the news, they showed him chewing the gum while walking, to which President Bush said, 'Show-off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ralph Nader said, this week, he's leaving the door open for running for president in 2008. Ralph Nader, yeah. In fact, he's still has the wrinkled suit ready to go, yeah. Hasn't cleaned it or ironed it since 2000. It's ready.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about this? Al Gore has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. How about that? That's pretty good, yeah. Believe me, that's ? that's one election he won't have any competition from George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore also nominated for an Academy Award. Al Gore will be on the red carpet. How about that? Al Gore on the red carpet. Is that what the Oscars need? More cleavage? I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know what's kind of sad? The Oscars are, what, still three weeks away? Al Gore has already eaten everything in his gift basket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big rumor is -- and you heard it here first -- I actually heard this from some speechwriter people in Washington. They say that Al Gore is going to announce he's running for president at the Oscars. That's the big rumor. See, I think all of the candidates should announce at the Oscars. If they talk more than 30 seconds, the music would drown them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news. Doctors say -- you know that 14-pound baby boy born that was born in Mexico last week? He's doing very well. He is now 18 pounds and living in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest trick amongst drug smugglers now is smuggling drugs into the country hidden in prunes. That's how you know baby boomers are getting old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there could be advantages to that. If you ate prunes that had crystal meth in them, you know you'd get to the bathroom on time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that story? You know what I'm talking about? The NASA astronaut just goes kind of crazy and she's whacky and she was stalking a rival. And when they caught her, when they apprehended her, she was wearing a wig and an adult diaper. And there's a lot of confusion because originally authorities thought she was Elton John.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story in the country right now, everybody's discussing the crazy astronaut. We enjoying this story? Pretty good story, isn't it? I've never heard of a better story in my entire life. I've read all the literature in the world and this is the greatest story ever told by anybody. It's almost too good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, yesterday, of course, astronaut Lisa Nowak was charged with several felonies after she drove 900 miles to assault another woman while wearing a diaper. Nowak was charged with attempted kidnapping and possession of a loaded diaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this is interesting. Before the arrest -- before the arrest, the astronaut was apparently stalking the woman for several weeks. Yeah. Yeah, the woman suspected she was being stalked by the astronaut because every time she looked in her rearview mirror, she saw the space shuttle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone in the world right now is running for the presidency in 2008. Everybody. See, the audience tonight is comprised of people who are running for president. Political experts are now saying that to win the presidency in 2008, a candidate has to get hot at the right time. Yeah, yeah. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Hillary's doomed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an announcement to make before we get started. ... Tonight, we're not stopping for commercials. We're going all the way through because I am wearing a diaper. We are going all the way through. All the way to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about that crazy astronaut, Lisa Marie Nowak, whatever her name is. As you know, she tried to kill her romantic rival. You know that part, right? In her car he had this a wig, a BB gun, a trench coat, a steel mallet, a folding knife with a four-inch blade, half a dozen latex gloves, three or four feet of rubber tubing and several large plastic garbage bags. She bought all the stuff at Costco. They said if she would have bought it from NASA, it would have cost $78 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amazing. Yeah, apparently, she told the police she was involved with another astronaut and that it was more than a working relationship, but less than a romantic relationship; or as the Clintons call that, marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what else? Oh, presidential candidate Barack Obama said he's gonna quit smoking. You know, he's a smoker. He's gonna quit smoking, which is good news for Hillary Clinton. You know, now that he's breathing down her neck, she won't have to worry about that secondhand smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, so many places banned smoking in public. If Barack Obama wants to smoke, he has to go somewhere where there is no one around, like a Joe Biden rally. You know, some place like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this. According to the latest presidential survey in Massachusetts, Senator Joe Biden has moved from 0% up to 1% in the polls. You don't want to peak too early! This could be a problem! He's peaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Joe Biden said today, he was happy to hear that Barack Obama is quitting smoking. Biden said, 'It is important to keep your lungs clean, I mean, you know, keep them bright and clean.' He's now back to zero, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's a funny story I saw on the news last night. It seems this couple is walking down the street in Washington, D.C., and they pass actor Will Smith. You know, Will Smith's got a, kind of, entourage, not a big -- you know -- people. And they thought he was Barack Obama. And they went over to Will Smith. They stopped him and said they were voting for him in 2008. Actually, same thing happened to Elton John. People thought he was Hillary. They didn't realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big rumor, and you heard it here first, is that Al Gore may announce he's running for president at the Academy Awards. Well, that would be a first. Somebody at the Oscars talking about politics who actually knows what they're talking about. That's never ? that's never happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. The principal of an Islamic school run by the government of Saudi Arabia has admitted they do use textbooks which describes Jewish people as apes and Christians as pigs. And they said they're going to continue to use these books because they are appropriate for 5-year-olds. How lucky are with that our Saudis are our allies, huh? Hoo! Thank God for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? A state senator in New York City wants to fine people $100 if you walk around the streets in New York listening to your iPod; $100 fine. I guess people have become so distracted, they bump into people on the sidewalk trying to urinate. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't it cold? So cold today, Saddam Hussein was glad to be in hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so cold, that Iran is attempting to enrich hot cocoa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so cold they had to chisel that whacky astronaut out of her diaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this -- this cold weather is no laughing matter. I mean, it's causing potholes. Were you aware of that, that the cold weather in New York City causes potholes? This city has more holes than a NASA screening process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush keeping busy. The White House just announced that President Bush is planning a trip to Mexico in March. Yeah. Yeah. Bush said he looks forward to celebrating Cinco de Marcho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about the crazy astronaut story. Yeah. Yeah. ... This week, in case you didn't know -- this week, a NASA astronaut attempted to kidnap another astronaut's girlfriend using a BB gun, mallet and pepper spray after driving 900 miles wearing a diaper. Yeah. Yeah. Which would all be amazing, except that the Russians got a monkey to do it last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced today he will leave on a tour of Latin America. His first stop -- Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something scary. I never knew this, and apparently I guess this is true. Justice Department officials have determined that a President of the United States does have the legal authority to have someone killed. Did you know that? ... No, if you're the President, you can actually legally order the killing of someone in the United States. And today, Bill Clinton withdrew his support for Hillary. He said, 'That's it. I don't want to be involved with that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that -- the famous designer Donatella Versace -- is that how you say her name, Donatella Versace? Well, she's recommended Hillary Clinton stop wearing those pantsuits and start wearing dresses and skirts. Versace said Hillary should treat femininity as an opportunity. You know, the way Bill does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And my favorite story, I love this story. After three weeks of therapy and counseling, the Reverend Ted Haggard announced he's now completely heterosexual. And to prove it, he ate a Snickers bar while pulling out his chest hair. He did that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about that? Yeah, yeah. You all saw that commercial, right? At the Super Bowl. I guess gay rights activists have demanded that Snickers stop showing that Super Bowl commercial with the two men kissing, because they say it's offensive to gay men. And if you think that ad was offensive, you should see the one they made for Nutty Buddy. That was really offensive. I don't want to tell what you what that one was like. Don't even want to go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, a lot of -- a lot of people are skeptical that the Reverend Haggard could be cured of his homosexuality in three weeks. Anybody -- how many believe that he's cured? I'm just curious. Do you believe he's cured of homosexuality in three weeks? But, see, you have to remember, he was on crystal meth. So he got a lot more done every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to make a million bucks? Here's what you do. Open a bar and call it Rehab. The place will be packed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, I have the latest on this week's big astronaut scandal. Have you all been following this crazy story? I have the latest. NASA just announced it has suspended astronaut Lisa Nowak for 30 days. Yeah, so everyone should rest easy knowing that the crazy diaper lady won't be operating a spacecraft until March 10th at the earliest. That's -- yeah. Then yes, then she gets to fly one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor in Hollywood right now is that Al Gore may announce he's running for president during a speech at the Academy Awards. Yeah, that's right, folks. They found a way to make Oscar speeches even more boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a weird story. The government of Cuba says it is deporting a top Colombian drug lord to the United States. Yeah. This means the Cuban government is kicking out the one person in Cuba who doesn't want to go to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you! Welcome to our big post-Grammy party! You all watch the Grammys last night? Congratulate -- the Dixie Chicks won five Grammys. I wouldn't say President Bush was upset, but today he tried to get the Supreme Court to overturn the ballot results. It only works once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore thanked the music industry for helping to protect the environment. Really? I think Snoop Dog alone has put enough smoke in the Earth's atmosphere to block out half the sunlight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of that, as you know, Al Gore has been nominated for two Academy Awards. But he has a bit of a problem as far as transportation goes. He doesn't want ? you know, he doesn't want to ride in a big car. And if you've seen Al lately, you know he no longer fits in a small car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, unless Hummer comes out with a hybrid in two weeks, he is screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today is Abraham Lincoln's birthday. As you know, Abraham Lincoln once said, 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' A very famous quote later proved wrong by the Clintons. But still a famous quote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and -- and in an interview in 'USA Today,' Senator Barack Obama says the shortness of his political resume is his greatest strength. You know, politics is the only business where people brag about how little experience they have. You know what I'm saying? Can you imagine a guy saying, 'Look, I've never been to medical school, I've never even seen 'ER,' but if you just let me do your brain surgery, I know...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama was on '60 Minutes' last night. And Steve Croft asked him this question. He said ? he said, 'Do you think America is ready for a black president?' Well, duh. What's he gonna say? 'Oh, you got me! No!' What a stupid question. 'Oh, you're right, Steve!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if Ralph Nader runs for president in 2008, it will make history. He will be the first person to ever run for president four times in the same suit. Did you know that? That's kind of a wrinkled suit he's got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And fashion designer Donatella Versace says that if Hillary Clinton wants to win, she should ditch the trousers. Yeah. Actually, you know what would improve Hillary's chances even more? If Bill kept his trousers up. That would actually help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has announced he is going on a five-nation tour of Latin America. And then he will come back home and decide which one to invade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news for job seekers. I understand NASA has some openings. Looking for new astronauts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA said over the weekend that they will review the psychological screening process for astronauts after what happened with that Lisa Marie Nowak, the astro-nut there. NASA said they will then determine if any modifications are needed. You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news over the weekend. Senator Barack Obama announced he's running for president. That's big. Excited? Very big. That's right. Yesterday, Senator Barack Obama gave a speech in front of thousands of people in Iowa. That's right. During the speech, Obama pointed out his family in the crowd, which was unnecessary since he was in Iowa. Someone's like, 'We know. We see them, yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, President Bush kept busy. President Bush gave a speech honoring Abraham Lincoln's birthday. Yeah. It was an awkward moment when Bush referred to Lincoln as the guy who invented the penny.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, in honor of NASA, FTD has just come out with their new 'I would drive 900 miles in a diaper for you' bouquet. Beautiful, beautiful.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how expensive roses have gotten. Today, the Reverend Ted Haggard said, 'Even with crystal meth and the cost of the male prostitutes, it was still cheaper being gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something I didn't know. This is kind of interesting. When Al Gore presented the best album award to Red Hot Chili Peppers the other night at the Grammies -- did you know this? -- Al Gore said that, because of global warming, the Chili Peppers are now 20% hotter than they were 10 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists now say that using stem cells, their own stem cells -- women will be able to grow their own breast implants using their own stem cells. Be able to grow them. You know what that means? LA could one day go back to being a farming community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember 50 years ago it was just orange groves? Those would all be breasts now, just all down Wilshire Boulevard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie at the box office is Eddie Murphy's 'Norbit,' where Eddie plays a huge, fat woman. Or as Clinton calls the movie, 'Dreamgirls.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think everybody has Valentine's Day fever. Hillary Clinton, for example, will be wearing her sexiest pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Valentine's Day is tomorrow. And in a recent interview -- this is interesting -- First Lady Laura Bush said that President Bush always forgets Valentine's Day. That's what she said. She said he always forgets Valentine's Day. The First Lady went on to say unless the holiday has a bunny or a flying reindeer, forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney announced he's running for president. If he wins, he'd be the first Mormon president. That's right. Yeah, first Mormon president. Apparently, Romney is planning on winning the soccer mom vote by marrying all of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at an international conference, an official from Cuba -- an official from Cuba said that his country restricts use of the Internet because it's 'a wild, new technology.' Yeah. Other wild, new technologies in Cuba include the 8-track, the typewriter and Tupperware. They're still getting used to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see. In the latest count, there are now 25 politicians who have announced they're running for President of the United States. And 15 of them also claim to be the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something I find just hard to believe. The Bank of America here in Los Angeles is now offering credit cards to illegal immigrants who do not have Social Security cards. Isn't that amazing? Or Social Security numbers. Isn't that ironic?

Well, he's condemning President Bush and the Iraq war now at his concerts. Ricky martin wants us out of Iraq now. Of course, the Bush Administration had no comment. You know, they're still waiting to hear from Marc Anthony. So we're gonna wait. We should know more later.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton is being pressed on why she hasn't apologized for voting in favor of the war in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a team of astronauts, engineers and scientists have asked the United Nations to make plans to deflect a giant asteroid before it hits the Earth on April 13th, 2006. You know about this? You heard about this story? There's a 1 in 45,000 chance it could hit, yeah. So it's about the same chance as Joe Biden has of being president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Bank of America is now issuing credit cards ? they're issuing credit cards to illegal immigrants. So you can get a Visa card before you even get a visa card.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you're saying to yourselves, where is Vice President Dick Cheney? I'll tell you. Right now he's in Tokyo.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's something ugly. In the year...2036, an asteroid is going to hit Earth. And it's -- it's a big one. It's like 460 miles wide or something like this and it's coming right here. Now I won't be around to worry about it, you won't.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things getting very nasty in Washington today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ash Wednesday, of course, marks the first day of Lent. A lot of people giving up things for Lent. Tony Blair giving up on the war in Iraq, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what happened today. The British announced they were pulling their troops out of the Iraq. Dick Cheney immediately called it good news. He said, 'It's a sign that we're winning.' How come when our allies pick up and leave, that's a victory for us? But when we leave, it's a victory for al Qaeda? How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today in Japan, Vice President Cheney made a visit to the USS Kitty Hawk. And as the Vice President boarded the ship, he was given a 19-gun salute. And then two Navy sailors were injured when Cheney returned fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Barack Obama was in Los Angeles last night for a huge campaign fundraiser. Yeah. Well, you see, that shows you what a great country this is -- when an African-American with a Kansas mother and Kenyan father, who spent time growing up in Indonesia, can run for president in the state where the Spanish-speaking people have elected an Austrian governor. That is America, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was a -- a big surprise with the Anna Nicole Smith hearing in Broward County, Florida, today. Apparently, the judge reached under his desk and pulled out 400 votes for Al Gore. They don't know how they got there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know something? Between the Britney Spears news and the Anna Nicole Smith news, I'm really starting to miss the crazy astronaut. What happened to her? When did she go? What happened to her?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney was in Japan. Were you aware of that? Yep, he stepped off the airplane in Tokyo and flashed that winning sneer. And then right now, Cheney is in Australia. Just for fun, he shot a koala bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big international news. That's right. I don't know if you heard, but yesterday, the British government announced they're going to begin pulling their troops out of Iraq. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Denmark and Lithuania have also announced that they're pulling their troops out of Iraq. Yeah. Actually, it's just one guy who's half-Danish and half-Lithuanian. Named Thor Nisdale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the '08 race heating up. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have both set up MySpace pages. But Barack -- this is true. They both have set up MySpace pages. That was the true part. This is also true. Barack has twice as many MySpace friends as Hillary. That's true. Yeah, he has twice as many, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- yeah, well, anyway, that's his name. Mitt Romney. He's had his first presidential campaign commercial. And Romney says in this ad, which just started running, this is not a time for talk and dithering in Washington, making him the first candidate to come out against dithering. Have you noticed? No one else has taken a stand on this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ooh, here's some good gossip. Now, I don't understand where this is coming from, but it looks like Hollywood is starting to turn on Hillary Clinton. Hollywood mogul David Geffen, he gave, like, $18 million -- some huge amount -- to the Clintons over the years. Well, he told columnist Maureen Dowd of 'The New York Times' that Hillary Clinton was too scripted, that Bill Clinton is reckless and both the Clintons lie so easily, it's troubling. That's what he said. Bad scripts, reckless behavior and lying. Thank God that kind of thing can never happen here in Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bad enough Hillary had to deal with the vast right wing conspiracy. Now it looks like there's vast left wing conspiracy, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Denmark announced today it is pulling its troops out of Iraq. People are starting to -- I didn't even know Denmark had an army. Did you know Denmark had an army?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a slow pullout. Lars will leave on Wednesday. And then Olaf will come home sometime in August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand this. Bank of America. Bank of America is now giving credit cards to illegal immigrants. See, this way they won't need cash. You can buy forged papers and phony driver's licenses on credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, in Texas, 40 illegal immigrants from Brazil were found stuffed inside a tractor-trailer. They weren't dead. They were just stuffed inside the truck. Of course, people were furious with this story. In fact, the manager at Wal-Mart said, '40? We ordered 50.' I don't understand what has happened. There are ten missing. What has happened?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. According to a new report by the United Nations, livestock are more responsible for global warming than all the cars in the world combined. They say the methane gas from cows has 20 times more global warming than carbon dioxide. See, that's -- see, my next cow is going to be a hybrid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, by God, how about this -- al Qaeda released seven new videotapes simultaneously. Oh, that's chilling, isn't it? Seven new videotapes simultaneously.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dick Cheney? He's at it again. You know the Vice President, Dick Cheney? He's on a world tour. He was in Japan, and now he's in Australia, and not going well in Australia, by the way. No, no, no. He went nuts and hit a guy in the face with a boomerang.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for America, everybody. Great day for America, not such a great day for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They're at it already. It's 18 months ? they're not even, it's even for the nomination, they're fighting, they're feuding. Barack and Hillary, fighting and feuding. Why can't they shake hands and say, 'May the best man win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The feud between them started when the Hollywood mogul David Geffen, who's an ? he supports Obama. He called the Clintons liars. Now, listen, when a Hollywood producer calls you a liar, he knows what he's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got some international news I'm going to start with. I don't know if you're aware of this, but Denmark and Lithuania have announced they're going to pull their troops out of Iraq. Denmark and Lithuania. They're taking them out, yeah. Yeah, apparently Denmark and Lithuania are going to pull out on the same day so all four guys can carpool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Bush is busy. President Bush flew to North Carolina today to discuss ideas for cutting gas consumption. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the best idea was for Bush to not fly Air Force One to North Carolina. He should take a bike next time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, of course, big story on the campaign trail. Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama have been sniping at each other back and forth. Yeah, it's getting very ugly, yeah. The good news for Obama is all this bickering with Hillary is making him look presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at a political rally, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called John McCain a 'great senator and a very good friend.' That's what he said, yeah. Yeah, apparently -- apparently, Arnold likes McCain because it's so much easier to pronounce than Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all ready for the Oscars? ... Al Gore is expected to win for his documentary on global warming. See, I hope he puts partisanship aside. I hope he includes President Bush in the acceptance speech. Don't you think he should? I mean, without President Bush, we probably wouldn't have a lot of this global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Al Gore said today that by the year 2015, it will be so hot that the relationship between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may actually start to thaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's campaign wants Barack Obama to publicly renounce Hollywood producer David Geffen's statement attacking the Clintons. Did you hear what he said about the Clintons? Geffen said, 'I know everyone in politics has to lie, but the Clintons do it with such ease, it's troubling.' That's what he said. See, I think that's an unfair statement. Just because you're really good at something doesn't mean it's easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Barack Obama answered that today. He said he wants to put an end to tit-for-tat politics. And Clinton said, 'He's half right. Let's take the tat out of politics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Tom Vilsack announced today he has dropped out of the race. The reason cited ? he's Tom Vilsack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, now the hard part -- telling his supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, there were signs Vilsack had had enough. You see what he did last night? He shaved his head and got a tattoo. That's not a good sign when you're a presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney has refused to back down from his criticism of Nancy Pelosi's stance on Iraq. Dick Cheney is not the kind of man who backs down from a fight. He might get a deferment to get out of it, but he won't, you know ? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Denmark said they're withdrawing their troops from Iraq. Now, if you're concerned this will embolden the terrorists, don't worry, they don't even know Denmark was there either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, England's pulling out its troops. Denmark's pulling their troops out. And today, Switzerland said they want their army knife back. So it's not looking good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'USA Today,' Cuba has major offshore oil deposits. Someday, oil could be Cuba's biggest export, as opposed to their current biggest export, Yankee relief pitchers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the 2008 presidential race? There's some interesting potential match-ups. For example, Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani. How about that for a match-up. It's an interesting choice. On the one hand, you have a pushy New Yorker with a history of marital problems, or you have a pushy New Yorker with a history of marital problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Barak Obama? And what I know about Barak Obama now is he smokes cigarettes. I didn't know that. Did you know that, before he started running? ... It's tough to quit. It's hard to quit. Anybody ever try to quit smoking? I mean, it can be done. Janet Reno gave up cigars. So I know you can...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore, how about Al Gore? That movie 'An Inconvenient Truth' has been nominated for an Academy Award -- two as a matter of fact, two. And it's all about the environment. And I can't think of anything better for the environment than an event which features 2,000 stretch limousines. Really, can you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced today he's dropping out of the 2008 presidential race. Our Vilsack dreams are crushed, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Vilsack dropping out, yeah. Vilsack says he dropped out because he had incredibly low name recognition, and that was among his wife and children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news this week, presidential candidate Barack Obama was endorsed by former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. That's right, yeah. This is big, yeah. Daschle -- Daschle is the first major Democrat to endorse Obama and the first person in South Dakota to see a black man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, of course, keeping busy. President Bush went to North Carolina this week to discuss alternative fuels. And he participated in a panel on cellulosic ethanol. Yeah. Or as Bush calls it, 'That stuff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic candidate Tom Vilsack pulled out of the presidential race today. I don't know who he is, either, but he's out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An embarrassing moment for the Israeli minister of defense yesterday. He was inspecting troops with his army chief of staff and&quot; failed to remove the lens caps from his binoculars. President Bush &quot;immediately hired him to oversee intelligence operations...in Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who may win an Oscar is Al Gore for the movie 'An Inconvenient Truth.' He may win an Oscar. He's got a good chance because if it was up to Hollywood, he'd be president, so they might give it him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all watch the Oscars last night? ... Oh, my God, wasn't it long?&quot; It was &quot;like JetBlue with celebrities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations, of course, to Al Gore. His movie won an Oscar. Yeah, yeah. Today, it got reversed by the Supreme Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Al Gore announced last night that for the first time, the Academy Awards had a green theme, which is not really true. It's always had a green theme. It's money and envy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this nutty judge in the Anna Nicole Smith case? The guy who was crying -- just crying all the time. In fact, today, he got flowers from the crazy astronaut. Did you see that? I guess they are hooking up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, presidential candidate Tom Vilsack, who was on our show just last week, announcing was running for president, has dropped out of the presidential race. Experts say it's because he failed to attract a very important demographic group when you're running for president -- people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a juror in the Scooter Libby trial has been dismissed by the judge after the juror was exposed to information about the case outside of the courtroom. How did this happen? I mean, the news channels talk about nothing but Anna Nicole and Britney Spears for the last two weeks. What channel was this guy watching? I'd love to have some information. I can't find that channel on my TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about this -- man. A middle school principal -- principal in a middle school in Tampa, Florida, has been arrested after he tried to buy $20 worth of crack in his office. See, that's when you know when you go to a tough school, when you can buy crack in the principal's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, of course, Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her role in 'The Queen.' And now -- this is the latest -- the real queen of England has invited her to have tea at Buckingham Palace. Yeah, the real queen, yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile, President Bush has extended a similar invitation to Larry the Cable Guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actress Angelina Jolie is in the news. Angelina Jolie is joining the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations. That's right. In a related story, Kofi Annan will be playing the part of Lara Croft in 'Tomb Raider 3.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;JetBlue Airlines ? they're having a hard time these days, and their hard times continue. JetBlue Airlines is experiencing more flight delays and cancellations because of another winter storm. It happened again, yeah. Yeah, in their defense, JetBlue says, 'We're really more of a May through August airline.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;U.S. Government -- this is weird, but it's true, apparently. The U.S. government has hired several psychics to help find Osama bin Laden. They've hired psychics to help find Osama bin Laden, yeah. So far, the psychics haven't been able to locate bin Laden, but they do predict that soon, he'll find true love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that Al Gore -- this is only a rumor. I heard he got crazy at the 'Vanity Fair' party. I'm told he left the light on in the bathroom. Mr. Environment, my ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quick question -- how many of you have money in the stock market? Not anymore!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whew! At one point today, the market was down over 500 points. Well, you know what caused the near panic? It was a severe slide in Chinese stocks. That's what it was. Chinese stocks. I guess there was a rumor in China that minimum wage would be raised to eight cents an hour. And people panicked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the drop started after the attempted assassination on Vice President Dick Cheney. See, that's when investors realized, if anything happened to him, President Bush would be in charge.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush toured several neighborhoods that are still mostly empty. And he had Dick Cheney coming along, you know, to shoot any looters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professors at Iowa State University say they're trying to find a way to turn fuel ethanol, you know, ethanol we use in our cars, into alcohol that people can drink. Well, that makes sense. Oh, yeah, you know, we have this huge oversupply of gasoline and such a short small liquor supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this? Today, in Afghanistan, a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the main gate of the Army base where Vice President Cheney was staying. Cheney says he's fine. He says the guy was either sent by the Taliban or by the American Bar Association in retaliation for that lawyer he shot in the face. It's one of those two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, actually -- apparently, they are saying Vice President Cheney was not the target of a suicide bomber in Afghanistan. They say it was just a coincidence that Cheney happened to be there while they were trying to kill him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's been a rough day for President Bush. The war in Iraq is not doing well. The stock market, of course, falls 500 points. But at least he can still enjoy playing sports. He likes playing sports. Show that footage today.&quot; NBC showed the President bouncing a basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell this is campaign time. In an effort to get the support of the Service Employee Union, Hillary Clinton has agreed to spend a day working as a nurse. Hillary Clinton as a nurse. That sounds like the plot of the worst porno film ever made. Doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to this week's 'Newsweek' magazine, they say Hillary's campaign refuses to consider Bill's infidelity. This is what 'Newsweek' said. They called it 'the elephant in the room that no one wants to address,' which is what got Clinton in trouble in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, that's the big story in 'Newsweek' -- will Bill Clinton embarrass Hillary during the campaign? I don't know. Do you think that's the problem? Is it possible for Hillary to be embarrassed by Bill anymore? Think about it. I mean, outside of Bill Clinton being caught in bed with the Reverend Ted Haggard, I don't think it's possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue introduced President Bush at the Republican Governors Association meeting yesterday. And this sounded like a backhanded compliment he gives President Bush. ... Listen to this.&quot; Gov. Purdue: &quot;You know, Vince Lombardi once said that success is not about strength, it's not about knowledge, but it's about will. That's the leadership that President George W. Bush is providing. Thank you, Mr. President.&quot; Leno: &quot;He's about as open as it gets. What is he saying there? That Bush isn't strong, he isn't smart; he's stubborn?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about this? Did you hear this today? The state of Virginia's General Assembly has passed a resolution apologizing for slavery. Well, whew, not a moment too soon, huh? You know, you want to nip these things in the bud before any hard feelings start to develop. You want to get right in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of that, did you hear this? According to a report by this genealogist, Al Sharpton's ancestors were slaves once owned by Strom Thurmond's relatives. And now, Al Sharpton wants a DNA test to see if they are related. And you know somehow this is going to end up that Strom Thurmond is the father of Anna Nicole's baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, a Florida court ruled that Anna Nicole Smith's body cannot be moved to the Bahamas until an appeal can be heard. See, this is great news for the cable networks, who were afraid this story would go away and they'd have to go back to covering the war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, the producer of Al Gore's movie won an Oscar for that film, 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Or as the Clintons call it, marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know this was going to happen. You know -- today, a group of Democrats started a 'Draft Al Gore' movement. I'm not sure if President Bush understands this. When they told him Al Gore could be drafted, he said, 'Well, can't his family get him in the National Guard?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he plans to differentiate himself from President Bush with a single word -- intelligence. That's what he said. Yeah, he ? that's what he said. He said, 'intelligence.' Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Intelligence? That's two words.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Tom Vilsack, of course, dropped out. Since former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack dropped out of the presidential race four days ago, Vilsack supporters are divided about which candidate to support now. Yeah. Apparently, one guy likes Obama; the other guy's backing Hillary. There are only two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore won an award for the global warming movie. Did you see Al Gore at the Oscars? Doesn't look like he's trying to save the planet, he looks like he's been trying to eat the planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I am not taking a stance. Listen, I'm not putting out a liberal ? I'm not flying a liberal agenda or a conservative agenda, but I think the conservatives are down playing the global warming because they'd like California and New York to be under water. I think that's what they're looking for. I see through their plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big thing to do to offset the damage done by the carbon emission is to plant a lot of trees. The trees do a lot of good. They do magic tree work. And the Mayor of L.A., the Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, he has this plan, in L.A., there's billboards everywhere. They say 'Let's Plant A Million Trees,' all these billboards ironically made of paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why he's using so much energy? Have you seen Al lately? I think he's been keeping that refrigerator door open a little too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney safely back in Washington after an attempt was made on his life in Afghanistan yesterday. Although, the Taliban denies they were trying to kill the Vice President. They now claim it was just a hunting accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. A state senator in Florida wants to ban the term 'illegal alien' because she says it is offensive. She wants to replace it with something more sensitive, like 'Mexican explorer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, aren't we getting a little too politically correct? I'm sorry. Huh? Have you ever seen someone that's here illegally say, 'That's it, I'm offended. Honey, put the kids back in the car. We're going back. No, I will not listen to it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, in New York City, the health inspector that gave a passing grade to that KFC/Taco Bell with all of the rats running around inside. Remember he said, 'Oh, there's no problem here?'&quot; He's &quot;been reassigned, yeah. He's got another government job, patrolling the Mexican border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market drops 400 points and today out of habit JetBlue apologized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know if we have any baseball fans, but baseball season about to start. Big scandal in baseball. Yesterday, police busted a steroid lab.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Cuba, some politicians in Florida are trying to ban the use of the term 'illegal alien,' because they think it's offensive. Yeah. The Florida officials say, 'We prefer the term 'good swimmer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' Man, you sound like a bunch of Republicans looking at Al Gore's electric bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of an embarrassing situation for Al Gore. You know, the whole global warming thing, turns out, his Tennessee -- excuse me, his Tennessee home has been using 20 times the average -- 20 times the energy as the average household. But to be fair, it is still not as much energy as John Edwards' blow dryer is using.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Republicans have been attacking al for having this big electric bill. But Al Gore says his bill is higher than average because his house is bigger than average. It's a 20 room mansion, you know, the kind of house you normally find a Republican living in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the Justice Department announced the biggest drug bust in ten years. Listen to this -- 400 members of the Mexican cartel arrested with 14 tons of marijuana, 5 tons -- tons -- of cocaine and a ton of crystal meth. Apparently, they're planning a second NBA all-star game in Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a state senator in Florida wants to outlaw the term 'illegal alien' because it is insensitive. Yeah. They want to go with the more politically-correct term, 'Wal-Martian.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And life expectancy in the United States has risen to a new high, 78 years of age, that's the new average. That's the new record. And they expect it to continue to rise until people are living well into their 90s. That's the good news. Unless they're planning on living on Social Security, then you're screwed. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, according to the Taliban, Osama bin Laden is alive, but they said if he dies, he now would like to be buried in the Bahamas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the courts have finally cleared the way for Anna Nicole to be buried in the Bahamas. The bad news ? they're flying her body on JetBlue, so it could take a few more weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study, atheism is in decline around the world. Although most atheists say they don't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice day today here in New York City, wasn't it? It was so warm here in New York City today, that the Wall Street brokers were jumping out of windows in shorts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news from the 2008 presidential campaign. Last night Senator John McCain right here on this program announced he was running for president. That's right. And then -- and then today he shaved his head and checked into rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow night here on the 'Late Show' Al Gore will announce he's going on the South Beach diet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, of course, running for president. Hillary Clinton's campaign is bragging that Hillary has raised over $1 million on the Internet. Yeah. In a related story, Bill Clinton is bragging that he has spent more than $1 million on the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another horrible day for the stock market. Down another 100 points. In fact, the only company that made money was the Tennessee power company that sells electricity to Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an announcement in South Carolina, Joe Biden, who is running for president, says he plans now to speak at more places, but to smaller crowds. Oh, yeah, like it's his choice. Shut up. I guess the huge stadiums are just too much for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Tom Vilsack, who just dropped out of the presidential race, was on TV today to talk about his presidential campaign. He said it was the best 12 hours of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, our old buddy George Clooney was in the news. He says he is not going to go into politics. You know, he's very political. But he's not going to go into politics. This is what he said, because he's had too much sex with too many women. Not going into politics because he's had too much sex. I bet Bill Clinton had a good laugh on that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of that, Hillary Clinton's campaign has issued a statement saying that she and Bill will be together this weekend in Selma, Alabama, which will be their first joint appearance together in a month. See, that's when you know you have a bad marriage, when you have to put out a press release saying you're going to be together for the weekend. And you need cameras to record it, in case people don't believe you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study -- listen to this, four out of ten Americans -- four out of ten say they would have sex with a co-worker. Here's the scary part -- that was just a survey of astronauts, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what today is? Today is the 74th anniversary of 'King Kong.' Seventy four years ago today, it opened down the street, around the corner at Radio City Music Hall. And you know what it is. It's the story about a woman who becomes involved with a creature from another species. And that wouldn't happen again until Maria Shriver met Arnold Schwarzenegger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's why New York is great. The diversity in this town is unmatched anywhere in the universe. They now, for the first time in 200 years, guess what's back in New York City? In New York City -- beavers. Beavers back in New York City. And as soon as he heard about this, Bill Clinton started slapping on cologne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it's incredible. It's an infestation of beavers. It's so bad, they were thinking about bringing in Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day -- true story -- an American Airlines employee tried to let former Vice President Al Gore bypass airport security, but guards stopped Gore and made him go through the metal detector. That's true, yeah. Yeah the -- good, yeah. The head of security said, 'We had to search Al Gore. He could have been armed with a speech.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madame Tussauds wax museum is opening a new location in Washington, D.C., and the greeter at the front door will be Abraham Lincoln.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saw '300' over the weekend. No, not the movie. That's the number of times Newt Gingrich has cheated on his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has admitted that he was having an extramarital affair back in 1998 at the same time he was the leading critic of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Newt said you can't compare the two affairs because his woman was really hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And surprisingly, Rudolph Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani has defended Newt Gingrich, saying it's okay Newt had an affair and no one is perfect. See, this is when you know the Republicans are in trouble. When a guy with three marriages and an affair is defending the guy with three marriages and two affairs so they can team up and beat a Clinton. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see all those people protesting while President Bush was in South America? Bush hasn't had that many people shouting 'gringo, go home' since his last trip to L.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 30 towns in Vermont have voted to impeach President Bush, but Bush says, hey, he doesn't care what a bunch of Canadians think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a speech in South Carolina, presidential candidate Joe Biden...says he has a plan for Iraq. He can solve the problem, and it's time to make a change. And then the kid at the counter said, 'Mister, you want fries with this or not?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel ? he's a Republican -- called a press conference to announce he'll be making a decision about running for president sometime later in the year. So he called a press conference to say maybe later in the year, he's going to say something important. This is the kind of bold, decisive leadership this country needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Dick Cheney's old company, Halliburton, which made billions in no-bid government contracts, has announced they're moving their headquarters from Houston to Dubai to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Isn't that unbelievable? A lot of senators are furious about this. Now they've got to wait for the couriers to fly halfway around the world with their bag of cash. You know, this is unbelievable. No more just driving up from Houston now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear that Vice President Cheney tripped today? Did you hear about this? Luckily, Scooter Libby was there to take the fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, I think Scooter Libby got off easy. Usually when you take one for Cheney, it's a shot in the face. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and last week NASA fired that crazy astronaut, Lisa Nowak. You know that woman there? Apparently there was no place in NASA for such an unstable woman. The good news -- today she was hired as a co-host of 'The View.' So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And one of -- one of President Bush's daughters, Jenna Bush, is writing a book about her time working with UNICEF. President Bush's daughter is writing a book. So apparently, the apple can fall very far from the tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about this. Celebrity birthday, Osama bin Laden, 50 years old. His friends took him out to the Tora Bora Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard At Osama bin Laden's 50th Birthday Party:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Who's up for 'Pin the turban on the blind Sheik?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'Death to these novelty candles that light again after you blow them out!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Mullah Omar's running late -- he forgot to change his clocks.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. To fool United States Special Forces, we had the bakery personalize the cake 'Happy Birthday Debbie.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'For he's a jolly good fellow, which the infidels will deny.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'I hope you don't already have season one of 'Who's The Boss?' on DVD.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Paris Hilton will attend anything.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'When does the stripper jump out of the falafel?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'No cake for Osama ? he's ballooned to 102 pounds.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Saddam sent a congratulatory telegram from hell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that President Bush and the big Latin American tour. And he's in Mexico, arrived in Mexico earlier today. He's down there looking for tequila of mass destruction, did you know that? Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visited a Mayan temple this weekend in Guatemala. And afterwards, true story, Mayan leaders performed a cleansing ceremony to clear Bush's bad energy. Yeah, that's what they did. They performed a cleansing ceremony. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, Bush got upset and said, 'Oh, yeah? He who smelt it, dealt it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After visiting Guatemala, President Bush flew to Mexico. That's right. Yeah, there was an awkward moment when Bush greeted the Mexicans by saying, 'Hello, future Californians.' And they thanked him and went north. Yeah. To their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I guess you heard, today was a big day for the US Border Patrol. They caught 500 immigrants trying to sneak into the country and 200 Halliburton executives trying to sneak out, so it worked out well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I guess you heard Halliburton is moving its headquarters to Dubai to avoid paying taxes in the United States. Isn't that unbelievable? Isn't that crazy? When did Halliburton start paying taxes? Is that new? What about those tax cuts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess they're going to go to the Middle East. Apparently, they're getting into terrorism. There's huge money in this now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know why there moving? Because some members of Congress have started investigating Halliburton for overbilling and for taking too much of American taxpayers' money for doing too little work -- or as Congress calls that, competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this just in -- Alberto Gonzales has announced he's going to move the Justice Department to Dubai. That just came out today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is coming under scrutiny for firing eight US attorneys, apparently for political reasons, at the request of the White House. Yeah. Things are looking so bad for Gonzales right now, he might have to shave his head and go into rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you, see, you want to get rid of attorneys, you don't use Gonzales, you bring in Dick Cheney.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a huge controversy at the Pentagon. The general, Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has publicly stated that homosexual acts are immoral and so is adultery. Homosexual acts and whoring around are immoral. Well, he just offended every member of Congress right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush has been touring Latin America. He renewed US support for Colombia. Apparently, Colombia has been suffering economically lately, since the breakup of Bobby Brown and Whitney. You know, they've been ? they've been hurting. The money's not coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while in Latin America, President Bush visited the ancient Mayan ruins, and then he invited their officials to come visit our ruins, the Walter Reed Medical Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush's final stop on his Latin American tour is Mexico City. Mexico City now and he'll return home tomorrow afternoon. The ironic thing -- most of the people there will be in the United States before he is. That's kind of ironic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen that? $3.50 a gallon in Los Angeles. It's unbelievable. In fact, gas is so high around the country now, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich have started a cheater's carpool to save money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And PETA, you know, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, they say based on this new UN report, livestock caused more global warming than cars. They want Al Gore to give up hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, ham and pork, to which Al Gore called PETA a bunch of global-warming fanatics. 'That's a theory! You're all hysterical!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is true. PETA says that because livestock causes so much global warming, we should give up eating meat. And I'm doing my part. ... I only eat meat now that's been run over by a Prius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks now says they plan to open 40,000 new stores&quot; all &quot;across the world, including China. Is that a good idea, opening stores in China? I mean, they're already out-producing us, right? We're going to give them more caffeine? Does that make sense?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be opening a turkey sandwich shop. Give them some tryptophan. You know, so they -- so they slow down. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Other New York Times Allegations Against Al Gore: &quot;10. In addition to 'An Inconvenient Truth,' wrote 'Big Momma's House 2.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Tells attractive ladies they can fight global warming by sleeping with him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you folks know this, no reason you should know it, no reason you should care, but over the weekend, Osama bin Laden had a birthday. Did you know that? The guy's still out running around having birthday parties. It was a big weekend. They went to the Tora Bora Hooters. It was crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in addition to his birthday, he had to turn his clocks forward to the 2nd century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden is older now. I think he's 50 years old, and he's starting to get a little salt and pepper in his beard. He also has some mustard, ketchup and hummus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's something weird. Like we need more weird things. A Taliban commander was captured. He was disguised as a woman. Guy dressed up as a woman, a Taliban guy, dressed up as a woman and they caught him. And he faces up to 25 years in prison or a year on 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, you know where President Bush is? He's in Mexico. It's nice we have a President who still goes on spring break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Mexico today. And he met with Mexican President Calderon to talk about immigration issues. That's right. Yeah. Unfortunately, things were cut short when during the meeting, President Calderon immigrated to California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is interesting -- while in Mexico, true story, President Bush visited the ruins of an ancient Mayan city. That's right. Yeah. And there was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'We will get the evildoers who did this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is March Madness, but enough about the White House Attorney General's Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about that? The Administration is still taking a lot of heat for firing eight US attorneys. See, that shows you how unpopular the Administration is, when people are siding with the lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, people in Washington are now calling for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. Do you have any idea how much trouble he's in? The White House is now thinking of replacing him with Scooter Libby. That's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, told the 'Chicago Tribune' he considers homosexual acts to be immoral. In fact, he feels so strongly about this issue, he will not even shake hands with the Navy's rear admiral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is safely back from his tour of Latin America. He said it really opened up his eyes, this tour. He said, 'It's amazing.' He said, 'We thought we had a lot of illegal aliens here. They're all over the place down there!' He said, 'Everywhere you go ? it's unbelievable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an elite military unit made up of Native American Indians is now being used to track down terrorists in the Middle East, including Osama bin Laden. They're using Native American Indians. They're over in Afghanistan right now. They haven't found bin Laden yet, but they did open 13 casinos. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you see this? Yesterday, Hillary Clinton announced the vast right-wing conspiracy is back. You know what that means? Bill must be dating again! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>

It's one of those things where you don't think about it and you don't think about it. The next thing you know, everybody is caught up in St. Patrick's Day. Here's exactly what I'm talking about. Earlier today down in Washington D.C., Vice President Dick Cheney shot a leprechaun in the face. Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Scooter Libby, by the way, is already wearing a button that reads, 'Pardon me, I'm Irish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the President returned from a week-long trip to Latin America. That's right. When asked about it, Bush said, 'Actually, I went to Latin America, Latin Mexico and Latin Guatemala.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big controversy -- the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff recently upset gay activists because he said that 'a homosexual act between two individuals is immoral.' Yeah. Then, the chairman added, 'Unless it's two chicks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie '300' is setting box office records, but there is a controversy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you watch last night? We're down to 11. Down to 11. Yeah. Not 'American Idol,' the number of U.S. Attorneys still working, that's where we're at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, you probably know this story by now. Alberto Gonzales has gotten into trouble for firing eight US attorneys for what appears to be political reasoning. Yeah. President Bush said today he still has confidence in Gonzales. Same confidence he had in Rumsfeld, Scooter Libby; Michael Brown of FEMA doing a hell of a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bush said today he's standing behind Gonzales, which is where you usually stand when you're about to push somebody overboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, as you know, got back from his tour of Latin America last night. Turns out, do you know he visited Guatemala by accident? Did you hear about this? Yeah. It was -- he was -- he wasn't supposed to -- it was an accident. Apparently what happened was ? see Bush is not good with words. He was on Air Force One and tried to order guacamole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professors at Iowa State University say they're trying to find a way to turn fuel ethanol, you know, ethanol we use in our cars, into alcohol that people can drink. Well, that makes sense. Oh, yeah, you know, we have this huge oversupply of gasoline and such a short small liquor supply.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a recent poll, anti-American sentiment is running high in Mexico. Half of Mexico's population says they have a negative view of the United States. And the other half, already here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexicans also angry with President Bush for not doing enough to allow more guest workers into our country. And President Bush is pretty firm. He told them, 'Hey. There are only so many Wal-Marts. We can't do everything.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, I guess you probably know about this, Al Qaeda's number-three man, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, has confessed to being the mastermind behind September 11th and said he planned 29 other attacks, including plotting to kill Bill Clinton. Yeah. Today, Hillary Clinton said, 'You too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, we would have prosecuted and executed him by now, but as you know, the White House fired all the attorneys. So we can't do that. It's going to take a little longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Halliburton is taking a lot of heat for moving its corporate headquarters to Dubai just to avoid paying taxes. And I think that's wrong. Don't you? Going to Dubai to avoid paying taxes. You know, I was -- I talking about this with my accountant today in the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech in Iowa, Barack Obama described John Edwards as cute and good-looking. How's this make Hillary feel? I mean ? 'Ooh, you're cute. Oh, you're good -- oh, you're cute. Oh, you're good-looking.' 'Hey, I clean up. What's the matter with me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you know this, but while President Bush was in Mexico this week, he kept sprinkling Spanish words and phrases into all his speeches. Yeah, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent campaign speech, Barack Obama complemented his opponent, John Edwards, by calling him 'kind of cute.' Yeah. Yeah, and then he said that Hillary -- then he said that Hillary Clinton has a really great personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The California Legislature announced that they have moved their state president primary from June to February. That's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all see people wearing those buttons, 'Kiss me, I'm Irish.' That's the most popular one. Least popular button ? 'Frisk me, I'm Arabic.' That doesn't seem -- those don't go anywhere. I don't know why that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Hillary Clinton's least favorite Irishman is? Barack O'Bama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a stunning new poll in 'Time' magazine, Hillary Clinton's lead has dropped from 19 points over Barack Obama to just 7 points. She's now blaming it on a vast left-wing conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we have had unseasonably warm weather here in Los Angeles. People sweating. I was sweating like Newt Gingrich watching 'Cheaters.' It's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting about this election? Several of the candidates are men who have been divorced, some of them more than once. And I guess now -- see, we have to expect that from politicians now. It's not like the old days. Remember the old days when a politician stayed married to the same woman his entire life? You know, like Bill and Hillary. There was a bond. You know what I'm saying? It's so different now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big rumor is Newt Gingrich may run for president. And Newt Gingrich has the best reason to stay out of the Mideast. He knows they stone adulterers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yesterday, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he's moving the California primary from June to February. I think that's what he said. It sounded more like he 'was moving the binary from noon to alley.' I don't really know what he said. I'm not sure what he said, something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to move the primary up to February so the season will be over in February instead of June. Kind of like the Lakers season. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a new book coming out about Bill Clinton. You know this was going to happen. It said Bill Clinton has had a number of one-night stands in Ireland, France, Taiwan, Rio and London. He flies overseas to have sex. Yeah, it shows you how times have changed. Remember the old days? He didn't have to leave his desk. You know, now, he can go everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the top 9/11 suspect, has claimed he is responsible for the first bombing of the World Trade Center, the shoe bombing attempt in the airplane -- remember that? Bombings in -- this guy is confessing to everything. A lot of people now are doubting him. They don't believe him. Well, did you hear his latest claim? He says he is now solely responsible for NBC's fall schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has been released from Washington Hospital Center after a heart procedure, and doctors say he's going to be fine. That's good news. He's going to be fine. Gee, I wonder why he didn't go to Walter Reed Medical Center?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study -- listen to this. Common chemicals found in soap and plastic may be contributing to America's obesity epidemic. See, that's when you got a weight problem, okay? When you're eating soap and plastic. Okay? That's a bad sign. You got to cut back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House today, big news. President Bush celebrated St. Patrick's Day by saluting prominent Irish-Americans. Isn't that nice? Yeah, Bush praised Sandra Day O'Connor, Tip O'Neill and Barack O'Bama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economists -- this is a true fact -- economists are predicting that this year, on St. Patrick's Day, consumers will spend $4 billion. Yeah. Unfortunately, about $2 billion of it is going to end up all over their shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks for coming out on a chilly ? it's chilly here, but it's terrible weather back east. Massive snowstorm hit the Northeast. Or as environmentalists are calling it, 'a temporary global warming hiatus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In more serious news, according to some new recently declassified documents, Iraq pretended to have weapons of mass destruction to prevent themselves from being attacked. Well, that plan worked out well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, you know that guy that confessed to all the crimes? He confessed to being the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and he also said he planned 29 other attacks, too. Because of this, they say he could lose his New York City taxi cab driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big scare at the John Edwards campaign headquarters. It was evacuated after a staff member opened an envelope containing white powder. Yeah. Turns out, it was just some John Edwards age-defying makeup base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess, in Al Gore's office, they found some white powder, too, but that was just from his powdered donut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton announced that the vast right wing conspiracy is back. Or maybe it's just that the vast right wing conspiracy is Barack. That's what it was. I got them confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of today, about all those US attorneys that got fired, you know, by Alberto Gonzales? Well, President Bush, on his trip to Mexico, he was able to find some workers that work for half of what these US attorneys are charging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, concerning the firing of Gonzales, you've been listening to the Republicans defending the Bush Administration. They keep saying US attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. Have you heard that expression? Sounds kind of dirty, doesn't it? They serve 'at the pleasure of the President.' What are they, down on all fours, barking like dogs? I don't know what it means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as you may have heard, the trial of legendary music producer Phil Spector started today. If you don't remember, Phil Spector is the music producer who shot that woman in the face back in February of 2003. Or as Dick Cheney's calling it, 'a hunting accident.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, one-third of Washington, DC is illiterate. Unfortunately, it's the third that's in charge of the government. That's the sad part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest trend in home building now is these custom houses that have two master bedrooms -- one for him and one for her. See, once again, the Clintons were ahead of their time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you folks are here on a good night. The entire balcony is filled with Federal prosecutors fired by Alberto Gonzales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend is the fourth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraqi war. Were you aware of that? Fourth anniversary of the start of the war. Yes, a lot of protests, a lot of antiwar protests. The Bush Administration said they were surprised by the number of protests. I was thinking, you know what? I'm not surprised they were surprised. That seems to make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a creepy story. A guy flying on a flight, long flight, six hour flight, British Airways. He is flying along. Halfway through the flight, he discovers that the person in the seat next to him, dead. Long flight, six hours, person in the seat next to him, dead. I say, hey, count your blessings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this, but earlier today...the world's largest airliner flew from Europe to New York. The plane's wingspan is as wide as a football field. Isn't that cool? It was great. Yeah, this thing is huge. It's huge, yeah. In fact, the plane is so big, it can carry 500 passengers, or 80 Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq. That's right. Yeah, when asked about it, President Bush said, 'See, and people said it would never last.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hooters announced it's opening up its first restaurant in the Holy Land. Yeah, after hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'As far as I'm concerned, Hooters is the Holy Land.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest in the world of politics. Al Sharpton and Barack Obama spoke on the phone for about five minutes yesterday. They have reportedly put their differences behind them. Yeah. So yeah, they're friends now. Yeah. Yeah, which means Obama can get back to running for president, and Sharpton can get back to doing whatever the hell it is he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Bush held a news conference where he accused the Democrats of playing politics with the firing of the US attorneys. You know, the attorneys he fired for not playing politics?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Bush even called Alberto Gonzales to offer his support. To give you an idea how unpopular Bush is, Gonzalez said, 'No, thanks. I'm fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney rushed to the hospital today. Apparently, Cheney was having pains in his leg. On the way to the hospital, he started having tightness in his chest, shortness of breath and profuse sweating. But when they told him he wasn't going to Walter Reed, he said, 'Whew!' It all went away and he was fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the former vice president of Iraq was hanged yesterday. Man, this round of 'Dancing With the Stars' is a lot tougher than last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Sandler (guest-hosting for David Letterman):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to make fun of President Bush. He's a nice guy. Actually, he told me he's seen 'The Waterboy' 28 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Sandler:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he saw -- he saw 'Click' 53 times. After 'Click&quot; came out, he called me and asked me where to get one of those remotes that rewinds everything five years. I told him to check out Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Republicans in Washington are looking for a replacement for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, but apparently they need to find an experienced legal mind that President Bush is comfortable with. Yeah. As a result, the number one candidate is Judge Judy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush -- President Bush spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki via a video conference call. Yeah, big video conference. Or as Bush calls it, 'a phone call you got to wear pants for.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first day of spring. Spring officially began at 8:07 Eastern time. ... Didn't Al Gore say we were all going to die by spring?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is officially Spring. How about that? Very exciting. Oh, you know, the trees are starting to bud, the grass starting to turn a little green,&quot; NASA &quot;astronauts switching to the lighter diaper, not too much fabric. The ones that breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today Al Gore blamed the end of winter on global warming.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, while on Capitol Hill today, Al Gore testified, 'If we act now, we can still save the planet. Well, not the whole planet, except Florida. See, screw them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's kind of ironic. While testifying, Al Gore was questioned by Hillary Clinton. Kind of, global warming meets global cooling. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another sign of springtime. I guess this happens every spring. The Ringling Bros. Circus arrived in Washington, DC this week. And that shows you the differences between the administrations. Like, President Bush, very excited to see the circus animals. And of course, Clinton was all excited to see the fat lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney went to the hospital because of discomfort in one of his legs. Apparently he injured it jumping for joy when he saw how high gas prices were. He went, 'Yes!' Came down a little hard on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is now offering interviews with Karl Rove and Harriet Miers before congress, but President Bush says they can only testify if they are not under oath, their answers cannot be recorded, they must be behind closed doors, and they get to wear disguises and pretend to be each other so nobody knows which one is which. So it doesn't seem on the up and up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week marks the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq, to which former President Bill Clinton said today, 'I can't think of any sadder anniversary, except my own.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, on the 'Today' show, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he doesn't care what Rush Limbaugh says because Rush Limbaugh is 'irrelevant.' Yeah, Arnold started pronouncing 'irrelevant' during the 'Today' show and finished pronouncing it during the 'Nightly News.' Yeah, it takes a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news -- Karl Rove was subpoenaed today. ... No, today, and this is true -- today, after Congress subpoenaed presidential adviser Karl Rove, President Bush said he will allow Rove to answer questions, but not under oath. True story, yeah. Yeah, the President said, 'I'm all for him talking as long as he doesn't have to tell the truth.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Florida is funding an anti-gravity classroom that allows students to experience weightlessness. Yeah. Not surprisingly, in the anti-gravity classroom, the American kids still weigh 160 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the latest. Players on the San Francisco Giants say they don't mind playing with Barry Bonds, because they think they may learn something just by watching him. Yeah. Yeah, Bonds' teammates say that, so far, they've learned 75 different ways to administer a flu shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore spoke on Capitol Hill today, to urge lawmakers to do more to fight global warming. He said we're facing a planetary emergency. You can tell he's serious when he talks about the world ending because he appears to be eating everything in sight. He's very fat right now, like a man who doesn't care.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Attorney firing scandal. The White House said today they would allow President Bush's top adviser, Karl Rove, to testify before Congress, but only if he is not placed under oath. Well, that should work out great, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?' 'No.' 'Okay, let's get things ?' what's the point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love when they say this -- this thing with the constitutional crisis. Oh, please. We haven't used the Constitution for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced his new plan. Have you heard about this? What he wants to do now, the audience will now be able to call up and vote for which US Attorney they think should be eliminated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday on MSNBC, indicted Republican Congressman Tom DeLay, who was forced to resign last year -- you might remember that. He said in his new book that he used to cheat on his wife all the time and get drunk. Says 'cause 20 years ago he was -- and this is his quote ? 'a self-centered jerk.' But that's all changed now. Now he's just a disgraced politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore returned to Congress yesterday. Everyone said Al Gore was treated like a rock star. Did you see him? I think the rock star was Meatloaf, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Even Ted Kennedy said, 'Hey, who's the fat guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Al Gore told Congress that global warming shouldn't be a political issue, it should be a moral issue. And a congressman said, 'A moral issue? What's that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said in the future, our energy sources would work similar to how the Internet works today. Really? So our cars would run on porn?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hooters has announced plans to open a restaurant in Israel. Now -- wasn't that's part of the original Clinton peace plan, if I'm not mistaken? Wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The land of milk and honeys, isn't that what he called it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Glamour' magazine, Hillary Clinton has 22,000 friends on her MySpace page. That's almost as many friends as Bill has on his eharmony.com page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Have you seen that anti-Hillary YouTube video that's been getting so much attention? You know the one where the woman throws a sledgehammer at a giant TV screen with Hillary talking on it. Yeah. See, they had to get a woman to throw the hammer, 'cause you know, there's no way a guy would smash a giant screen TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Al Gore told members of Congress, this is a quote, 'That the planet has a fever and it needs a doctor.' Yeah. When they heard this, the Congressmen asked Gore, 'You won an Oscar for this?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources at the Pentagon -- this is interesting -- say that several factories in Iraq will soon begin making clothes to be sold in the United States. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, 'cause Americans only want two things from Iraq, a stable central government and affordable, quality menswear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Hillary and Bill Clinton appeared together at a fundraiser in New York last weekend. And they're appearing again this weekend. Bill wants to be there, because -- you know, to support her campaign. And she wants Bill there, because it's spring break.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said today the toughest part about getting married to his current wife was finding a wedding song they both hadn't used before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Now, see, you probably don't know this. In an interview that came out today, Rudy Guiliani's wife admits that Rudy is her third husband, not her second husband. Did you hear about this? She completely forgot about her first marriage. Oh, Bill Clinton does that all the time. That's nothing. No big deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the President of Iran was supposed to come to New York tomorrow, but he's called off his plans to visit New York City. You know why? Anybody know why? He couldn't get tickets to 'Fiddler on the Roof.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when President Bush heard the Iranian leader canceled his trip, he called him and said, 'If you stop traveling, that means the terrorists have won. Oh, you are the terrorist.' Then he hung up. He got a little confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today that he has legal opinion on his side in the Alberto Gonzales case. President Bush can claim executive privilege, according to his lawyer, Alberto Gonzales.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Lisa Nowak, remember her? The diaper-wearing astronaut? Well, she has entered her plea in that attempted kidnapping case. She said she is not guilty by reason of incontinence. So we will see, see how well that holds up. I have no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And one of the preliminary judges in the Anna Nicole Smith case was picked up for smoking a joint in a park in Hollywood, Florida. He's a judge. He's sitting under a tree, smoking a joint, gets arrested. Now, this wasn't the judge who was crying in court. I don't want to know what he was smoking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know that Malibu is only 27 miles long, but has 25 rehab facilities? Isn't that amazing? Yeah. In fact, you know where the phrase 12-step program came from? That's how far it is between rehab centers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very nice. At a Washington museum, a new exhibit is about to open that features a first grade report card of President Bush's where he received straight As. Isn't that nice? Yeah, that's very nice. Yeah. Yeah, this sounds impressive, but President Bush was 23 at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The '08 presidential campaign, well underway. That's hard to believe, but it's really grinding along already. This is the latest. Country legend Merle Haggard has written a tribute song called 'Hillary' that is supportive of Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Yeah, Bill Clinton has also written a tribute song called 'Hilary,' but it's about Hilary Duff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. According to a new report by a genealogy company, Barack Obama's great-great-great-grandfather was born in Ireland. Yeah. Yeah, that should really solidify Obama's support among Irish African-Americans raised in Hawaii. He's got those two guys sewn up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the campaign, earlier today, Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent the day campaigning in Newark, New Jersey. Yeah. Yeah. Afterwards, McCain said, 'Oh, my God, and I thought Vietnam was bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, NBC and the Fox Network announced they're going to join forces to create a new broadcast portal that will compete with YouTube. Yeah. Yeah, this amazing new broadcast portal is called 'television.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, being March madness, of course we're now down to the final four. But enough about Mrs. Giuliani's former husbands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know this story? Well, it turns out Rudy Giuliani's wife forgot one marriage. Originally she said she was married twice before. Now it turns out, oh, she was actually married three times. But she says she never talks about the first marriage. But then neither does Bill Clinton. He doesn't talk about his first marriage. You know, so, that is fairly common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In more serious news, according to 'the LA Times,' insurgents in Iraq are targeting educated people like professors and librarians. Yeah. One book owner said that if the intelligent are targeted and killed, then the only ones left to lead the country would be the ignorant. So at least they are getting closer to an American-style democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, I think the pressure is starting to get to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Did you hear about today? He tried to fire the cast of 'Boston Legal.' Oh, it was terrible, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, President Bush is worried, too. He thinks this could hurt his guest attorney general worker program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate Tom Vilsack -- remember, he announced his candidacy on our show? And then hours later quit the race. He says he is now officially endorsing Hillary Clinton. Well, that should put her over the top, huh? Unless, of course, Walter Mondale comes out for Dennis Kucinich, then it's wide open again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new tell-all book, Republican former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said he partied too much, drank too much and slept with too many women he wasn't married to. You know what Republicans call a guy like that? A Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his book, DeLay also criticizes other Republicans. That was Ronald Reagan's rule, remember? 'Never criticize other Republicans.' See, this is where you've got to be careful, because he could run into those Republicans one day in prison, and that would not be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest Census survey, the number of people without health insurance has dropped by 2 million. Well, duh. That's because they are dead because they didn't have health insurance. That's why. That's not really a positive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that 29% of US households do not have internet access and little hope of ever getting it. You know what technical names of people with no hope of internet access? Do you know what they call them? AOL customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Things I Can Say Now That I'm Miss USA. 3. 'I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the congratulatory presidential phone call came from Clinton, not Bush.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day in New York City, am I right about that? Whoo! So nice here. I tell you how nice it was. Hillary Clinton ? it's spring, you know, -- Hillary Clinton switched over to her seersucker pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great weekend for Hillary Clinton,&quot; who &quot;raised $2.6 million at her Hollywood fundraiser last night. I wasn't there. Do you know who wasn't there? Bill wasn't there. Where was he? He was in New York at Elton John's birthday party. Well, you know Bill, he loves the fat girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the story is that scientists have made a new breed of sheep, which is part human, part sheep. I'm not kidding! ... Yeah, it's 15% human! They made a sheep that's 15% human. You know, if you make Hillary Clinton 15% human, she'll make a lot more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security announced that they are -- there are 600,000 fugitives unaccounted for in America: 600,000. And those are just the ones in the Bush Administration. That's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the government -- the government says they can't account for these fugitives. Well, of course they can't account for them. They're fugitives, right? That's the definition of a fugitive! You can't be accounted for! Exactly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know about this? Iran has seized 15 British sailors, who Iran claims had sailed into Iranian waters. Now, Britain denied the sailors entered Iranian territory, and Iran responded by denying the Holocaust. That was their answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And three bodyguards of the Iraqi deputy prime minister assisted a suicide bomber in last week's failed attempt to assassinate the deputy prime minister. See, that's when you know you're in trouble, when you have to hire bodyguards to protect you from the bodyguards. That's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, on '60 Minutes' Sunday, they had this reformed terrorist guy. Did you see this? He said the biggest reason young Muslim men become terrorists is their objection to the arranged marriage. That's pretty bizarre, isn't it? I mean, how ugly is the chick when the guy's going, 'You know, I'd rather blow myself up.' That's not a good sign. That's not a good sign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some members of Congress are thinking about impeaching President Bush because he is adamant about not withdrawing troops. What are the odds of that? That's pretty ironic. Two presidents in a row would be impeached for not pulling out. That is unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bill Clinton was the surprise guest at Elton John's 60th birthday party at Madison Square Garden. One embarrassing moment, when he saw Elton John from behind, he said 'Hillary?' A little awkward. A little awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an aide to the newly elected Democratic Senator Jim Webb of Virginia was arrested for trying to bring the senator's gun into the Senate office building. The senator carries a gun, and he had it in his briefcase and got stopped. Webb said he needed the gun for protection, and apparently he had an afternoon meeting with Vice President Cheney. So he just wanted to make sure. Said he was packing for the meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview, Rudy Giuliani's wife admitted that Rudy Giuliani is not her second husband -- actually, her third husband. She forgot about her first husband. But Rudy understands. When they started dating, you know, he forgot he had a wife, too. So those things -- these things can happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, I guess these meth labs are now coming out with candy-favored meth. Don't we have that? Aren't those called Cocoa Puffs? Don't we have those already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in less than two weeks, the US Olympic Committee will decide whether LA or Chicago will be the US host city for the 2016 Olympic Games. So it's the City of Broad Shoulders versus the City of Fake Boobs. So we'll see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I think LA has the inside track. First of all, all of the foreigners are already here. That's the great part about it. See, they don't have to travel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoa, you hear about this? How scary is this? Officials say flaming space junk falling out of the sky barely missed a passenger jet that was flying over the Pacific Ocean. Unbelievable. There's enough to you have to worry about when you're flying. You know what 'I'm saying? You get up ? 'Oh, thank God, there's no terrorists onboard.' 'Oh, oh. Thank God, the pilot isn't drunk.' 'Oh, hey, I didn't get stuck sitting next to big, fatty sweat guy.' Just when -- just when you think you're home free ? 'Ah!' Half a ton of flaming space junk hits. Frightening thing that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and speaking of that, did you hear about this? The astronaut Sunita Williams, I think that's her name, may set a US record in space. She's been in the International Space Station since December, and the flight that was supposed to bring her back home has been delayed. She could now get stuck on the space station for months, months. Isn't that amazing? I didn't know JetBlue flew to the International Space Station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, McDonald's has got a new hamburger out, the one-third of a pound hamburger. Have you seen this? I had one. It's pretty good. I'm not saying it'll clog your arteries, but they are calling it the McCheney, okay? That's the name of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, while you folks were applauding, Mr. Giuliani remembered another marriage. Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, you know -- did you hear about this? According to this week's 'Newsweek' magazine, they've now come out with&quot; a carbon-friendly diet &quot;that reduces greenhouse gases. Let me tell you something, okay? If your diet is so bad that you're causing global warming, just stay out of Taco Bell, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and did you see -- did you see Karl Rove at the correspondents dinner last night? ... White people are yelling, 'Stop it! Stop it! You're making us look bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God. That's like the Republican version of spring break. You know what I'm saying? Their wet t-shirt is old guys in tuxedos sweating profusely. The wet t-shirt competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the former astronaut -- astronut, whatever you want to call her, Lisa Nowak, you know that woman?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, earlier today, in Florida, a boat full of 100 Haitians washed ashore. In their luggage, 200 Cubans. Yeah. What are the odds of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in the Midwest report they are now catching drug dealers making strawberry flavored crystal meth. They're selling crystal meth in candy flavors. See, that's always been my biggest beef with crystal meth, the taste. You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now if they could just come out with a zesty wintergreen heroin -- oh, my day would be complete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and -- interesting article in 'USA Today' about a group of Native Americans at an Indian reservation in Minnesota who are trying to save the language of Dakota that's on the verge of extinction. That's the native ? Dakota, yeah. It's the same thing we're trying to do in Los Angeles with English. You know, try to preserve it.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And actor and former US Senator Fred Thompson -- the guy from 'Law &amp; Order,' somebody from NBC -- he might run for president, thinking of running.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and more serious news -- the UN Security Council expressed concern over Iran capturing those 15 British soldiers. Yeah. Concern, yeah. You know, with the UN involved, this could escalate from concern to severely frowned upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bet Iran is shaking in their boots now. This could -- a stern letter from the UN. Ooh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, it was in this week in 1867, the country of Canada was founded. Prior to that date, American pioneers had no access to cheap prescription drugs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in the Midwest report they are catching drug dealers making crystal meth in candy flavors. Apparently, a lot of addicts felt their teeth weren't rotting out fast enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, of course, the first night of Passover. And today, the president of Iran denied it ever happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in more serious news, as you know, Iran is currently holding 15 British sailors hostage. And the United Nations has told Iran, the world is united against them. So now the Iranians know how we feel, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear about this? The Naval Academy announced last week it is investigating allegations of lewd behavior and heavy drinking by a group of midshipmen on spring break. Apparently, they were groping women and drinking. Of course, President Bush was furious. He said, 'Hey, these guys are acting like a bunch of drunken sailors.' You know, he was furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Nevada, as part of a training exercise, firefighters burned down the famous brothel, the Mustang Ranch. Remember the Mustang Ranch? They burned it down. The sad news -- two congressmen still inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although Hillary Clinton set the mark by raising $26 million for her presidential campaign in the first quarter of 2007, Mitt Romney, the Republican, right behind her with $23 million. That's something Hillary hasn't felt in 20 years, a man breathing down her neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Circuit City announced it is laying off 4,300 workers. Do know whose decision it was to fire these people? Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Al Gore had a birthday over the weekend. I don't want to say Al Gore's putting on a few pounds, but I understand at the party, they had a cake jump out of an even bigger cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Cialis -- you know, that Viagra-like drug. They announced they're going forward with a major marketing push in China. China. Cialis in China? Haven't they already stolen enough of our missile technology?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should we really be -- is that a problem in China? Not enough people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, baseball season has officially started. And for the second year in a row, President Bush did not throw out the first pitch. You know why? The rumor is he's worried about being booed. Yeah. That never stopped the Kansas City Royals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger making news all the time. In a recent speech, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger told his audience, this is a quote, 'Don't believe the platitudes of a politician.' Yeah. Of course, when Arnold said it, it sounded like, 'Don't believe the platypus of a bad optician.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, the Reverend Al Sharpton announced yesterday he is not running for president. Yeah. In a related story, nobody asked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is running for president. I don't know if you're aware of this. But she set a fundraiser record. She's already raised $26 million. That's a lot of money. It's more than anybody. To put that in perspective, that's more money than President Bush lost in all the years he was a businessman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, last night was the first night of Passover. Passover, of course, commemorates the Jewish people's escape from Egypt to establish their own homeland while surrounded by enemies on all sides that wanted to wipe them out. Well, what a difference 3,500 years makes. Whoo! Thank God. Thank God those days are gone forever!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what you call people wearing yarmulkes during Passover? You know what you call them? Presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story in the presidential campaign is how much money Hillary Clinton has raised. It's a record. She raised $26 million in the first quarter and then shifted $10 million she had left over from her Senate race for a total of $36 million. In fact, Hillary has so much money now, John Kerry, now hitting on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you hear about this? According to 'US News &amp; World Report,' plans are under way for a movie about the Clinton Whitewater scandal. Remember that? It's been a long time. And they're trying to get Charlize Theron to play Susan McDougal. Remember, she was in the one who went to jail for that. Trying to get Charlize Theron to play her. And if that happens, Bill Clinton will play himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and listen to this. And the part of Hillary? That's going to be played by Nathan Lane. Yeah. So it should be a fascinating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big issue in this year's campaign is how many of these presidential candidates are guys that are divorced? Some of them two and three times. Do you think that hurts the candidate? Do you? No? See, I think it gives them valuable experience. They know how to negotiate with the enemy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you hear about this? Police in Connecticut arrested a man for speeding, who identified himself as Vice President Dick Cheney. They took the guy to the hospital. Obviously, the guy has mental problems. I mean, these days, what sane person would try to pass himself off as Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Dick Cheney doesn't like to tell people he's Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here you go. A man in Dallas, Texas, arrested after leading police on 35-mile chase while driving the church van completely naked. Nice to see the Reverend Ted Haggard is back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a press conference today, this is interesting, President Bush was asked if he knew the current price of a gallon of gasoline and Bush's answer was within a few pennies. He did well, yeah, which isn't surprising, because Bush spends most of the day watching 'The Price Is Right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican candidates are announcing their first quarter fundraising totals so far. Apparently, they're doing very well. They've raised a lot. Mitt Romney announced he's raised $23 million. Rudy Giuliani said he's raised $15 million. And Congressman Tom Tancredo announced he's raised two children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the start of the baseball season, which is great. ... I like when the stadiums have promotional nights. They give stuff away, t-shirts, badges. They don't always go well. Back in the 1970's, the Yankees, at Yankee Stadium, gave away free baseball bats. Thousands of drunk guys in the South Bronx at night, let's give them all weapons. What could possibly go wrong? It's like giving Dick Cheney a martini and a handgun. It's a very predictable result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Baseball is now all about the money and the steroids. They make so much money now, they take the steroids to shrink their testicles so they have more room for the giant wallets in their pocket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news for a change. Those 15 British hostages returned home today. Very good news. Very good news. Who would have thought those sailors would be released before Sanjaya was? That's unbelievable. I thought for sure he would go first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Iranian President Mahmoud 'I'm a nut job' -- is that how you say it? He has asked Britain not to punish the sailors for their confessions. You know, I don't want to -- but in less than a day, they confessed? You know, if we could figure out how to get O.J. and Robert Blake into Iranian waters...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when they left, they were each given a gift bag by the president of Iran. Isn't that like a consolation prize? What is he, Bob Barker now? 'You didn't get the jet ski, but we have some lovely parting gifts. Come on down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I'm saying? Look, I've never been held captive. I'm sure it's horrible. But I -- would you have taken a gift bag?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't remember John McCain leaving the North Vietnamese prison -- what was it, the Hanoi Hilton -- after five years with spa treatment and a free pedicure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, anyway, the sailors were brought to the palace to meet with the Iranian president before being released. Listen to this -- then they were given new suits to wear. They gave them all brand new suits, but no ties, because ties are considered a Western extravagance. You know, you know, as opposed to living in a palace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not making this up about the gift bags. ... Do we have -- we have one of the gift -- we have one of the actual gift bags. I'm going to show you. This is what was in it. A tub of this: &quot;I Can't Believe It's Not Hummus.' A toothbrush. They're British, so, you see, it comes with instructions. I guess this is to torture them if they didn't talk. A DVD of 'The Black Donnellys' on NBC. And I guess this is a home version of the biggest game in Iran. This is the big television game show, 'Jew Or No Jew.' Finally, a 'Goats Gone Wild' video. So that's all this great stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, as I'm sure you've heard, Secretary of No Particular State, Nancy Pelosi, is being sharply criticized, even by 'The Washington Post,' for visiting Syria yesterday, against the wishes of President Bush. See, our official policy is to punish Syria for not renouncing terror. Hey, maybe the visit from Nancy was part of the punishment. 'Okay, we give up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, yesterday, President Bush was on vacation. He went on vacation to his ranch in Texas for what the White House said was a short weekend break. You know, aren't we at war? Huh? Anybody else's weekend start on Wednesday? When does that happen? Try that at your job. 'Boss, I'd like to take the weekend off. I'll be leaving Tuesday night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo has thrown his hat into the presidential ring. He said he decided to run for president after talking over it with his family. But even members of his own family are going, 'Who are you again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney stunned everybody by raising $23 million in the first quarter of this year; $23 million, all in small donations. Apparently, he got $1 from every Osmond. That's what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I love it when these politicians try to be all things to all people. Like in the speech -- I guess Romney was speaking in front of the NRA, I guess it was. He's saying how he is a lifelong hunter. He's a lifelong hunter. Turns out he's hunted exactly twice. Two times in his whole life. Dick Cheney has hunted lawyers more times than this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what he said, he's a lifelong hunter but he's only -- yeah. He's only held a gun twice and one of those was a glue gun with Martha Stewart. Okay, so it doesn't even count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on CNN last night, presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said he wants to make it clear he is not in favor of gay marriage. No. He believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, no matter how many times it takes them to get it right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this -- according to 'USA Today,' same-sex marriages are now becoming more acceptable and commonplace in Mexico. More Mexican people are accepting gay marriage. In fact, a lot of Mexicans who sneak into the country illegally are just here antiquing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the president of Iran released the 15 British hostages, and the hostages say they were well treated and were not tortured. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. The hostages said, 'Not once were we forced to eat British food.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone was surprised that the hostages were released so quickly. I guess it was only about 13 days. When asked why they were released, Iran's president said, 'We realized that whole Iranian hostage thing is so 1979.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another prominent Republican is taking some heat today. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, in an effort to, I guess, to woo conservative voters, he's been telling people he's a lifelong hunter. But it turns out, the truth is, he went hunting once when he was 15 years old. And once last year. So by lifelong, he means he went twice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I think it's important to add that both of the times he did go hunting, he shot an old man in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for the 15 British sailors that were held hostage in Iran. They returned home today. On their way out of Iran, they were each given a little gift bag with a CD In it. It's a compilation album of the Iranian pop charts. That's what I call jihad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The annual Easter egg hunt at the White House is going to be a little different this year. Instead of eggs, they're going to be hiding Alberto Gonzales' e-mails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the jokes don't seem as good today, the Jewish writers are off for Passover. The Christian writers off for Good Friday. So the entire monologue, written by Muslim extremists today. That's why I want to apologize.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, House Speaker...Nancy Pelosi went to Syria in defiance of the White House. And now, more bad news for President Bush -- looks like she's coming back, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Barack Obama announced he has raised almost as much money as Hillary Clinton -- $25 million to her $26 million. See, what surprised most experts is that Obama raised most of his money from small, individual donors, while Hillary got hers from big lobbyists and wealthy supporters. And today, Hillary blamed the whole thing on a vast, ordinary person conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republican Mitt Romney, who's taken a lot of heat for calling himself an avid hunter, he spoke in front of the -- like, the NRA or some gun group. He said, 'I'm an avid hunter!' Turns out he's only hunted twice in his entire life. He's now saying no, he's hunted more times. In fact, he says -- this is a quote. This is what he said today. He said, 'He is an avid rodent hunter.' Yeah. In fact, his favorite hunting spot -- Taco Bell. Yeah, he got -- bagged nine rats last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And those -- those 15 British hostages that were released from Iran are now taking criticism for accepting gift baskets from the Iranian president. Turns out the gift basket had a CD in it. In fact, it was the same Kevin Federline CD they had used to get them to confess, yeah. They just gave them a copy of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And once they got home, they were held hostage by another Iranian, the cab driver that took them home from the airport. Yeah, that's seven hours. Seven hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this seems pretty sleazy -- Circuit City laying off 3,400 employees and wants to replace them with cheaper labor. These people have done a fine job. They're just doing it as a cost-cutting measure, and they say that people can apply to get their old jobs backs, but for a lot less money. Isn't that awful? See, I got a better idea. Fire the CEO who makes $8 million, hire him back at $4 million and you can probably save a thousand jobs right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a new land where gay marriage is legal -- Disneyland -- you hear about this in the paper today? The Disney Company has changed its position and will now allow gay couples to participate in its Fairy Tale Wedding program. You know what this is at Disneyland? Disney wedding packages start at $8,000. It includes a wedding planner, the ceremony, flowers, table decorations, a ride in Cinderella's coach and costumed trumpeters. Sounds gay to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, quite frankly, I'm surprised there are any straight guys in the program up to this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they call it the Chip 'n' Dale package. I think that's what it is. A Chip 'n' Dale wedding package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Walt Disney Company announced they're going to allow gay couples to hold Disney weddings that feature a Cinderella coach, costumed trumpeters and Mickey and Minnie Mouse in formal attire. This is big. They're going to allow it. Yeah. All that stuff, yeah. Yeah. However, most same-sex couples say they aren't interested, because it sounds too gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is spending six days at his ranch in Texas. He says he will not -- he will not attend the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Yeah. When asked why, the President said, 'Someone ruined it last year by inviting a bunch of children.' He didn't -- yeah. He was mad about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big movie opening today, 'Grindhouse.' The big movie. Rose McGowan plays a girl with a machine gun leg. Dick Cheney's dream girl right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was so cold in Georgia, Newt Gingrich had another affair just so he could stay warm.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. In an effort to prove he really is a hunter, yesterday presidential candidate Mitt Romney shot and killed the Easter Bunny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I love this story. While speaking to some gun group, Mitt Romney ? he's running for president. He proclaimed himself a hunter. Said he was a hunter. Turned out he only went hunting twice in his entire life. Twice. Rudy Giuliani has been married more times than this guy went hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and he said, Romney said -- this is what he said -- he said he's not a big game hunter. He just likes hunting rodents and mice. See, the nice thing about hunting mice, after the kill, you can just Scotch tape them to the hood of your car when you're driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson has announced he is running for president of the United States. Well, experts are saying that this announcement could have absolutely no impact on the race whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill and Hillary Clinton are on Easter vacation in the Dominican Republic. They are at a very exclusive private resort and spa. The press is calling it a second honeymoon. Hillary has gone all out. I understand she brought some sexy new pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, see, Hillary likes to get Bill out of town during Easter, because Bill has a habit of looking for eggs and then trying to fertilize them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republicans issued a statement today demanding that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi get back to work. President Bush would have made the statement himself, but he's still on vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A consumer watchdog group says there should be a box to check on your ballot if you want a dollar of your taxes to fight crime instead of going to presidential candidates. Which I think is a great idea. I mean, anytime you take a buck away from a politician, you're fighting crime right there. You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, ladies and gentlemen, while you were laughing at that last joke, Barack Obama raised another $25 million. That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, Barack Obama is a guest on the program tonight. He'll be on the show tonight. He -- he wants to make two major announcements. One, he is announcing his plans to end the war and two, he wants to announce his plan for canceling 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today down in Washington DC is the big annual Easter egg hunt they have on the White House lawn. And no surprise here, the $87 billion egg coloring contract went to Halliburton -- $87 billion! That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the kids are all running around hunting for the Easter eggs and periodically they pick up some of Cheney's shell casings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was -- it was great. I mean, the kids did a tremendous job. The kids found hundreds and hundreds of eggs. And I'm thinking well, hell; let's let them look for bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot going on in the world. Of course, our President working hard. President Bush hard at work on the immigration issue right now. Trying to fix that problem. This is the latest. Earlier today, just a few hours ago, President Bush was in Arizona and he inspected an unmanned plane that's used to patrol the border. Yeah. At least the plane was supposed to be unmanned. It turns out they found six Mexicans inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he's going to appear on the show Pimp My Ride. Yeah, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's going to be on Pimp My Ride. This is, of course, great news for fans of the show, but bad news for the guy who does the closed captioning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, DC this morning,&quot; the &quot;First Lady hosted the White House's annual Easter Egg Roll. President Bush had a lot of fun. He found three eggs, which is a new record for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold in New York City, Don Imus and Al Sharpton were hugging each other for warmth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know by now, radio personality Don 'I messed up' has been suspended for two weeks for making racially insensitive remarks. But not everyone is upset with Imus. In fact, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is thrilled that people are asking for someone else to resign besides him for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, CBS now ? that's the radio station that does it -- is refusing to comment whether Imus' suspension is paid or unpaid. They won't say. So basically, what they're saying is, 'He's wrong! What he said is horrible! It's despicable! Take the next two weeks off. Have a nice vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The suspension doesn't even start until Monday. Shouldn't it start right away? If you do something wrong, shouldn't it start right away? Isn't it like catching a drunk airline pilot? 'All right, hold onto this bottle, but I want it back Monday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually -- no, they say they're leaving him on this week because he's using his radio show to raise money for his favorite charity, Sons of the Confederacy. Sons of the Confed -- I think that's -- I think that's what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know what really bothers me about this Imus incident? Think about this. It's been two days now. Right? Two days. There's been a ton of media coverage. A woman's basketball team has been slandered, and no sign of Gloria Allred. Is she okay? She could be pinned under a car or something. Why hasn't ? shouldn't she be out front now? What happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And talk about statements coming back to haunt you, last week, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, 'the rifleman', as we call him, he called himself a lifelong hunter. Turns out he only hunted twice in his life. And, of course both, of those times were for Easter eggs. So it doesn't even count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, Romney's denying that. He says, oh, he hunts a lot. You know, he won't just shut up about it. He said he hunts a lot, but he only hunts small animals like Jed Clampett did. Remember Jed Clampett from 'The Beverly Hillbillies'? Compared himself to Jed Clampett -- that a good idea? Anybody going to want to vote for President Jed Clampett? Huh? Especially after eight years of President Jethro? I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Not a good idea. No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush outlined his guest worker program, or as we call that in LA, 'the nanny.' Yeah, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards, as well as a number of other Democratic candidates, say they will not participate in a presidential debate next month because the debate is on Fox News and Fox News is biased. Well, how are you going to stand up to terrorists when you're afraid of Fox News?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, a number of Circuit City employees, who were let go, announced that they are suing the company, claiming they violated California's age discrimination law. Very strict -- California very strict about these things. In this state, it is illegal to replace someone older with someone younger, unless, of course, it's a second marriage. Then it's okay. But other than that -- other than that -- ooh, very strict, very strict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this just in, the NAACP reception for Don Imus has been canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, do you like celebrity birthdays? Happy birthday to Cheetah, Cheetah, the original Tarzan chimp, 75 years old. ... Yeah, Cheetah lives quietly in California, peeling bananas with his feet and dragging his knuckles on the ground and ah -- no, wait a minute, that's the Governor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. It's a couple of days late. But yesterday, the White House finally got around to having its annual Easter egg roll. They just did it yesterday. Yeah. And... there were several cartoon characters there, including Clifford the Big Red Dog, Bugs Bunny and Charlie Brown. Yeah. Yeah, nice, yeah. Yeah, afterwards -- afterwards, President Bush said, 'Finally, a summit meeting I enjoyed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, an image of the Virgin Mary appeared in a tree along the Mexican border. Yeah. Yeah, not surprisingly, the tree snuck into the US two weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanjaya -- this kid, Sanjaya sang in Spanish tonight&quot; on &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;I guess it's part of President Bush's plan to drive out the illegal aliens.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very cold on the East Coast. Very cold in America. Very cold on the East Coast. Just to stay warm, Don Imus hugged Al Sharpton today. Snuggled up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big environmental news. Madonna and The Police have signed on to play that Al Gore's benefit, you know, that concert to save the planet. They've signed up to do that, and it's about time because the musicians from the 80's, they should do their part for the environment. Because it all started with the hair spray thing. That was them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold weather continues back East. I'll tell you, New York was so cold; people were shaking like Don Imus at the Apollo Theater. That's how cold -- whew!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, you folks might not have heard this. It happened just a few moments ago. Don Imus has been fired from MSNBC. He got fired. Yeah. I don't know what he's going to do now. I think we can rule out coaching basketball.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they said on the news today, he might have to settle for doing a show on a lower-profile network with a smaller audience than MSNBC. You know, like NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I thought this was very gracious. The women he insulted, you know, the Rutgers women's basketball team, have agreed to meet with Imus. But, again, Imus doesn't get it. You know where they're meeting? He wants to meet at the Cracker Barrel. See, right there. It's the wrong venue. It's the wrong venue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this just in, North Carolina officials have dropped all the charges against the Duke Lacrosse players. Remember that rape case? Yeah. Yeah. Said they are innocent. Little suggestion for the guys, don't celebrate with a frat party, okay? Just stay home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a speech in Alabama, Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said the one thing about him you can count on is when he makes a decision, he sticks with it. If you don't believe him, you can ask either of his two ex-wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all of the major Democratic presidential candidates have now pulled out of a presidential debate sponsored by Fox News because they feel Fox News is biased. Fox denied the claim and said, 'Well, the Republicans are going to win anyway so -- nee-nee.' So, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent study shows that the country of Mexico is generally very accepting of same-sex marriages or as they call them down there, 'Juan-on-Juan relationships.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. The wholesale price of oil has dropped $3 a barrel. You know what that means at the pump? Nothing. You're going to get screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But have you seen the pictures, the videotape of Don Imus lately? Have you gotten a good look at the guy? If I were Don Imus, I wouldn't be saying anything about other people's hair. Honest to God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House says it wants to appoint a high-powered official to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and issue directions to the Pentagon and the State Department. Yeah. Yeah, this person would be called the President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just days after her controversial trip to Syria, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she's considering taking another controversial trip, this time to Iran. Yeah. Yeah, and even worse, when Pelosi gets back, she's going fishing with Don Imus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A producer has been fired from CBS News because Katie Couric taped a story for the news that turned out to be plagiarized from 'The Wall Street Journal.' Yeah. Yeah, viewers became suspicious when they noticed that Couric was reading the story directly out of 'The Wall Street Journal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember -- remember the lady astronaut who drove cross-country in the diaper and tried to kidnap another woman? ... Well, her name is Lisa Nowak. Florida prosecutors just released documents listing the items that police found in her trunk when she was on this trip. Besides the diapers, they found bondage photos and drawings, British currency, unidentified pills, a wig, a rubber mallet, a B.B. gun, a knife, a rubber hose and 11 fortune cookie fortunes. It's for real. By the way, that's what they should put in the Oscar gift basket next year. Those exact items.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just so you know, before we begin, this monologue has been inspected and approved by Al Sharpton. It's our new NBC policy. So we can move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now. Maybe you don't know this. You were waiting in line. CBS has now fired Don Imus. How many times do you get fired from the same job? First, NBC fired Don Imus. Then CBS fired him. Then this afternoon, ABC hired him just so they could fire him, too. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, I don't think Imus gets it. Like, today, he blamed the whole thing on the Jewish-owned media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night on Fox News, host Sean Hannity said his opinion of the Don Imus scandal is that conservatives are going to be the victims on this. So, Don Imus insults the Rutgers women's basketball team. Who's the victim? Rich white guys. How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary Clinton announced today she is going to meet with the Rutgers women's basketball team. Haven't these women suffered enough? Geez! Please!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there was some good news for Don Imus. Today, he got a note from President Bush saying, 'Hey, thanks for knocking the Iraq war off the front page. Appreciate it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, on the show tonight. Very excited about that. I'm very excited about that. You know, she is second in line to be president. Yeah, yeah. And with Cheney ahead of her, that line could move pretty quick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, she just got back from a trip to Syria. Syria. You know, I know the Democrats aren't the rich party, but that sounds like about the worst spring break trip ever. Doesn't it? A horrible spring break trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani getting some flak for not knowing the price of a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread. You know, they always do this. You know? Gallon of milk, they always ask him that. But he does know how much a wedding cake costs, because he bought three of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, they always do this with candidates. They ask him, 'How much is a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread?' Most guys don't know what that is. Even single guys don't know what a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread is. But ask a guy what a six-pack and a frozen pizza costs, he can tell you right down to the -- right down to the -- exactly, exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know if you've heard this. I have the latest on the Don Imus scandal. You keeping up with this? I have the latest. This thing may be over now, I guess. Yeah, yesterday, Imus was fired by MSNBC. And then today, he was also fired by CBS. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when reached for comment, Imus said, 'I can't believe I've been kicked off TV and Sanjaya hasn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More people running for president, that's the latest. Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter has filed papers to run for president. But in his official filing, he misspelled the word 'president.' Political experts say it's all part of Hunter's plan to attract Bush supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton said she doesn't lie awake at night worrying about attacks from her political opponents. Yeah. Yeah, but she does lie awake at night wondering where the hell her husband is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Radio legend, Don Imus, fired today by CBS Radio for his racist depiction of the Rutgers women's basketball team. A huge story. On every news channel. All the papers. I'll tell you, if there's any good that came of this, it's who knew we'd ever talk this much about women's basketball? You know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imus has been taking it from all sides. A lot of famous people, a lot of media personalities, really taking notice of this. I even read that Santa Claus has announced he's changing his trademark laugh to 'ha, ha, ha.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snoop Dogg yesterday pled no contest to attempting to bring a gun and marijuana onto an airplane last year. I don't know what his argument for the gun was, but Snoop claimed he uses the marijuana to treat migraines. Apparently not smoking pot gives him a headache, so he needs...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imus fans shouldn't worry about Imus. He is working on a new show, 'The Amazing Racist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, on Wednesday, NBC fired him. Then, on Thursday, CBS fired him. And today, a group of real cowboys demanded he stop wearing that stupid hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, friends -- friends say this whole thing has left Imus confused and angry. Like yesterday, after he left CBS, he attacked Jack Black and Don Ho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as I mentioned, as you know, the show 'Imus in the Morning' has been cancelled. It's being replaced with a new show, 'Sharpton in the Morning.' That's the new show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you see what happened to Al Sharpton today? You see that? Huge gash on his head. What happened was he and Jesse Jackson both saw an open microphone, rushed at it ? boom! They knocked each other down. Unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, even though those Duke lacrosse players were found completely innocent of those rape charges, Jesse Jackson said in an interview that they are not totally innocent because they paid a woman to dance naked and that's the first step that leads to domestic violence. Well, that and also your wife finding out you got your assistant pregnant. Both of those can lead -- both of those can lead to domestic violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate John Edwards said, regarding the Imus scandal, he believes in forgiveness. He believes in forgiveness and Imus called Edwards to thank him and asked if he knew of any radio jobs in that other America he's always talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House said today that they have lost the e-mails requested by congressional investigators -- e-mails that may have dealt with the firing of those eight Federal prosecutors. They lost them. Yeah, yeah. Today, the Administration has tried to assure Americans that they are not corrupt, just incompetent. Just incompetent. Thank God for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my -- let me ask a question. Have you -- how do you lose an e-mail? You know, if I get a pop-up ad from a male enhancement company, it's in my computer forever. I can't get rid of it. How do these guys lose an e-mail?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scarier moment ? a scary moment earlier today for Vice President Dick Cheney's plane. You hear about this? Air Force Two. He's on the plane -- wham! Hits a bird over O'Hare Airport. The bird got sucked in the engine. Or as Cheney called it, 'hunting accident.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's the first bird he ever hit, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it's Friday the 13th and down in Washington DC, a confused President Bush lit a menorah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's a guy, Mitt Romney, running for president. And historians are already considering the fact that if he becomes president, he'll be the only one in history ever named Mitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was talking to the press a couple of weeks ago and he said that he likes to hunt, he goes out hunting all the time. Well, it turns he's only been hunting twice in his life. So he's not a lifelong hunter. And now the aides, his aides, are panicked. They're saying, 'Well, you got to, for God's sake, will you go hunting and shoot somebody in the face?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somehow -- I don't know how, but somehow, even though he's now been fired, and you'd think it would all be over, the Imus story continues. That's right. It's still all anybody's talking about. Today -- this is the latest -- Hillary Clinton announced she will now meet with the Rutgers women's basketball team. Yeah, yeah. Hillary Clinton's going to meet with them. In a related story, Bill Clinton announced he's going to meet with the Rutgers women's swimming, volleyball and gymnastics teams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Don Imus is now off the air. Been fired from CBS, MSNBC and -- yeah. Well, today, Don Imus made a point of thanking one of his sponsors, Bigelow Tea, for sticking by him. Yeah. That's right. Thanked them, yeah. Imus said, 'I want to reward Bigelow Tea's loyalty by publicly linking them to racism one last time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a hell of a week for Don Imus. After being fired from his TV and radio shows, he had a face-to-face meeting with the Rutgers women's basketball team last night. The meeting went on for three hours and afterwards, the team forgave him. That's nice. If this was a sitcom, he would be sentenced to be their equipment manager, right? And eventually they would win his heart. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a strange twist to this Imus story. The governor of New Jersey, John Corzine, was seriously injured on a car accident on his way to Imus' meeting with the team. He's in critical but stable condition. And it is wild. What a week for New Jersey. Their basketball team gets insulted, their governor is in intensive care, there's a brutal snowstorm on the way, and Tony Soprano got his ass kicked in a Monopoly squabble. Right? That's why we have a robot governor. He cannot be destroyed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our nation's Vice President Dick Cheney had yet another scare today. A bird flew into the engine of his plane as it arrived in Chicago. Which means Dick Cheney finally killed a bird. Congratulations. You can lay off the old men.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, it was so wet; Hillary Clinton had to wear a wetsuit over her pantsuit. That's how wet it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, meteorologists believe the storm actually started in Washington. What happened was the hot air from Congress mixed with the cold chill from the White House to create a low pressure area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, pretty bad storm. In fact, the White House said today the storm destroyed over 10 million e-mails. That's what happened. Oh, tough break. And right before the Gonzales hearing! Oh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, they ? I'm from New England. They call this storm a nor'easter. That's what they call a nor'easter, which really confused President Bush. When he heard a nor'easter was coming, he said, 'Great, let's get the eggs out again.' See, he got confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people weren't sure how to file their taxes this year, because their job is in India? I'm just curious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest basketball scores -- Rutgers women 1, Imus 0. That is the latest score.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now the Rutgers girl's basketball team has accepted Don Imus' apology. Apparently, they bumped into him when he was at their college radio station, applying for a job. I guess they saw him there, said, 'Hey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many think firing Imus was the right thing to do, by applause? How many do not agree with the firing of Don Imus? How many never heard of Don Imus until this thing started?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, if you think Don Imus was upset he got fired on Thursday, you should have seen Al Sharpton. He was furious. He said, 'What? You can't fire him now. I have rallies and marches set up for this weekend. People are coming in. You can't cave this early! You're a bunch of wusses! I need at least a week!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, things not looking good for the Republicans. John McCain's campaign is in freefall. Mitt Romney got caught making up those stupid hunting stories. Rudy Giuliani's been married three times. In fact, the Republican candidates are doing so badly, Democrats are going to have to work extra hard to screw up this next election. Yeah, even harder than they did last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people asked for&quot; tax filing &quot;extensions this year, even President Bush. You know, he got an extension, because he's still trying to decide whether or not to write off Alberto Gonzales. So he's still trying to figure it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the weather back East continues to be terrible. In fact, they have had so much rain in my home state of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney -- yeah. Well, you hear about this? Mitt Romney now claims he went hunting with a spear gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so wet in New York City, the Yankee pitchers were commuting to the game on the same rafts they came here on. That's how bad it -- how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess this storm is called a nor'easter. See, that's a New England ? that's what we say in New England, call it a nor'easter. And, of course, when President Bush heard about this, again, he got very confused. He said, 'Does he mean next week will be a nor'passover?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, the parade of presidential candidates of saying really stupid things is in full swing. Did you hear about this? Presidential candidate Tommy Thompson from Wisconsin ? he's speaking to a Jewish group, a primarily Jewish audience, and he tells them -- he said, 'For the first time in my life, I'm earning money, which is part of the Jewish tradition.' Experts say this could hurt him with the Jewish vote in Iowa. Both of them. Yeah, both of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And mitt Romney has announced that his son, Tagg -- Tagg Romney -- has joined the campaign. Yeah, yeah. No word from the other kids, Skip, Jump Rope and Seesaw. We don't know where they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's some very exciting news, especially for comedians. John Kerry says he has not ruled out running for president again. Oh, the voters have ruled it out, but he has not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this is true. During a book signing in Denver, and then in an interview on a Denver news show, Kerry said he is reopening the door for running for president in 2008. Yeah. You know, first Kerry said he wouldn't run. Now, he said he might change his mind. So, it's nice to know he's consistent on changing his mind.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations are in order. The winner of the Boston Marathon, a 28-year-old man from Kenya named Robert Cheruiyot. He ran the -- you see that? He ran the marathon in 2 hours, 14 minutes, 13 seconds. Unbelievable. And the winner of the Harlem Marathon, Don Imus. Ran through Harlem in two minutes -- so much faster. So much faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, this whole Imus thing has got people taking talking and people taking sides. And I read one columnist said today, he said about the firing of Don Imus, that it could mark the beginning of the thought police. Ooh. The thought police. Yeah. Not much chance of Paris Hilton getting pulled over there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wal-Mart announced this week they're going to open up health care clinics. Wal-Mart. How scary is that, huh? Go in for your annual physical, there's that 80-year-old greeter putting on the rubber gloves. 'Well, hi there, Mr. Leno. Let's take a look see.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Los Angeles continues to have the highest gas prices in the country. It's like $3.70 or something here. Yeah. In fact, at the gas station near my house, a big sign says, 'Now accepting your tax refund.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chicago is still in the running to potentially host the Summer Olympics in 2016. LA was eliminated from consideration this weekend, which really is a shame. I was, you know, looking forward to a 16-hour commute to work every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One scary moment yesterday for Newt Gingrich. First, Newt got worried when he heard the IRS was cracking down on cheaters. Then he realized, 'Oh, guys who cheated on their taxes, not their wives.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the...storms back East, over 250,000 people are still without power. In fact, it's so bad in Washington, DC, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales decided to resort to destroying e-mails by hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And FEMA told Congress this week that a revised emergency response plan it was ordered to develop after Hurricane Katrina will not be ready by hurricane season. Well, there's a shock. FEMA not ready?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's only been two years. I'm surprised FEMA even knows when hurricane season is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh. And this week, during appearances in Denver, John Kerry reopened the door to running for president in 2008. You know something? Somebody should really lock that door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Kerry said he talked it over with his wife. And, you know, he needs to raise enough money for a campaign. You know, so, which, in Kerry's case, is the same thing, talking it over with his wife and raising money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, John Edwards has a new campaign slogan ? 'shampoo, rinse, repeat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this? According to 'The Boston Globe,' presidential candidate John Edwards got two $400 haircuts at a Beverly Hills salon -- 400 bucks for a haircut. And he also said he got a $225 facial at place called the Pink Sapphire. The Pink Sapphire. Doesn't that sound like something that shows up on your credit card statement? You quickly have to explain to the wife, 'What? It's a haircut place. It's a haircut place, honey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican candidate Mitt Romney says that Hillary Clinton is wrong when she says it takes a village to raise a child. But when Hillary's book came out, Romney said that Hillary was right. It does take a village to raise a child. You know, for a lifelong hunter, this guy sure shoots himself in the foot a lot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Hugh Hefner announced he is backing Hillary Clinton. Hugh Hefner is backing Hillary Clinton. Hillary actually likes Hugh Hefner. Now, don't confuse that with Bill, who likes huge heifers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a recent interview, First Lady Laura Bush says she can't fall asleep at night without reading. She says that her nightstand holds so many books, she fears it may collapse. Well, I guess maybe you could tell which side of the bed is hers, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential hopeful John Edwards had a $400 Beverly Hills haircut. That's a lot of dough. I mean, honest to God, ladies and gentlemen, this hairpiece didn't cost me $400.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the worst part. Earlier tonight, Edwards hosted a dinner to raise money for a facial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales raised his right hand, swore to tell the truth, then everybody had a good laugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Gonzales' motto is 'The buck stops -- over there! Over there, it stops!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he testified today that he had nothing to hide. Well, not anymore. He deleted everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Laura Bush said in an interview today that she can't fall asleep without reading, as opposed to her husband, who can't read without falling asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, campaign records now reveal that John Edwards, who's using his campaign money to get $400 haircuts in Beverly Hills...said he only went to the expensive stylist because they are friends. Friends? What kind of friend charges 400 bucks for a haircut? I've got enemies that don't screw me that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but Edwards insists that this is in keeping with his view that there are two Americas, one that pays $400 for a haircut, and the other America that spends its money on stupid things like rent and food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love candidates saying stupid things. Presidential candidate Tommy Thompson, the former governor of Wisconsin -- did I mention he's running for president -- well, he's speaking to a Jewish group, and he's trying to be friendly, you know, make a little joke. The thing is, this Jewish group ? it's all Jewish people. And he actually says to them, 'You know, for the first time, I'm earning money in my life, which is part of the Jewish tradition.' But then he apologized. 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry -- I said I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That's the speech I was supposed to give in front of the Muslim group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wal-Mart announced that they're opening health care clinics in their stores. Isn't that unbelievable? Wal-Mart's going to be a health care clinic. And in a related story, the famed Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota announced today they're going to start selling lawn furniture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health care clinic inside a Wal-Mart? Boy, that's something to think about next time you hear, 'Clean-up on aisle four!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you folks were applauding, John Edwards raised another $3 million for haircuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards, of course, a candidate for president, is trying to show folks he's a hawk, so today declared war on split ends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say that this John Edwards gets expensive facials. He gets facials. What is the deal on the Democratic candidates? The male candidates get facials and the female candidates wear pantsuits, so what...is going on?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, we had Sanjaya on and, as you know, he was, of course, voted off 'American Idol.' ... Well, you know, they had a bunch of stuff in the paper today, and the experts say that America wasn't going to vote for a guy who spends that much time on his hair, which is more really bad news for John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talked about this last night, that John Edwards had a $400 haircut in Beverly Hills -- $400 haircut. Now the latest rumors, Hillary Clinton may have spent nearly $200 getting her back waxed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in testimony yesterday, Alberto Gonzales admitted the firing of US attorneys was mishandled. He said, yes it was mishandled, but he was only marginally involved. Well, that's a good alibi. 'I am not involved in my own job. Thank you. I have no idea what's going on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying Alberto Gonzales is in trouble, but today, Sanjaya said, 'Get rid of him. Vote him off. He's a loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is some good news for a change. According to new reports just out today, on the average, 2006 was the safest year for airlines. How about that? Well, it's, you know, it's mostly ? it's mostly due to JetBlue. You can't have an accident if you never leave the runway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And FEMA told Congress that their new hurricane emergency response plan will not be ready anytime soon. When asked why, you know what they blamed? The weather. 'Yeah, it's the weather. We just can't get it together.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart announced this week they're going to open up thousands of health care clinics in their stores. Apparently, they got a great deal on some really cheap doctors from China.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart, health care? I don't know -- health care at Wal-Mart. That's how you know you've got a bad HMO. 'Well, here, go down to Wal-Mart. Go down there. Ask for Jeb the greeter. He'll take care of you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, how embarrassing would that be? You're standing there naked. You're bent over the cashier there. You know what I'm saying? 'Price check on colonoscopy! Price check! Price check on colonoscopy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now those of you interested in alternative fuels, here's something interesting. Scientists have found a fungus in elephant dung which they say can be turned into fuel. In fact, when they presented the discovery of the elephant dung to the head of the science department, he went 'Ew!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I didn't realize this Sunday, were you aware of this, Earth Day -- are you aware that Sunday is Earth Day? So in honor of Earth Day, all of the jokes tonight have been recycled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks remember Vice President Al Gore? Very close to being president but he got more votes than the guy who won.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyway, Al, Al has gained weight, has gained quite a lot of weight. As a matter of fact, he is on a diet. He is actually on a diet. And it is not going well. As a matter of fact, the ice caps are disappearing faster than Al's&quot; waistline, &quot;so he's in trouble there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Al hired a personal trainer and the trainer said, 'Al, here's your problem. It's an inconvenient ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday, by the way, in case you don't know, is Earth Day. Earth Day is the day we reflect on how we are destroying the planet. And then we stop reflecting and we fire up the jet skis and go right back to destroying it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanjaya has quite a weekend ahead of him. He's going to the White House Correspondents Dinner over the on Saturday night, which means there's a really good chance he will meet President Bush. And it's crazy to think that a guy who did not get the most votes, who's not good at what he does, is famous despite the fact that he's consistently horrible, would get the chance to go to the White House and meet Sanjaya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, in case you are going to the correspondents dinner, don't tell but President Bush think Sanjaya is the prime minister of India.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, of course, was Earth Day ? or, as President Bush calls it, Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Earth Day, of course, the day we all plant a tree. And then eight months later, we cut down the tree, hang lights on it and stick it in the living room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of the candidates are out campaigning on the big Earth Day weekend. They had some good ideas. Like, John McCain suggested we bomb Iran using just hybrid planes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newt Gingrich said the next time he cheats on his wife, he'll do it with the lights off to save energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has vowed to wear only organically grown pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see Bill Clinton picking up some trash on the beach? You see that? Then he gave her cab fare home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the candidates jumping on the environmental bandwagon. In fact, John Kerry and his wife, Teresa, are coming out with their own book on the environmental and it just came out. I have the first copy. It's called 'And You Thought Al Gore's Book Was Boring.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's going on with Sheryl Crow? You know about this? She has suggested that to help the environment, only one square of toilet paper should be used for each trip to the bathroom. One square per person. Oh, that'll work out well. Did you ever see the size of the people coming out of that hometown buffet? I'm sorry. Okay? Okay, they couldn't wipe their nose with one square. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One square of toilet paper?! Thank you. I'm not going to be shaking hands anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see who was at the White House Correspondents Dinner this past weekend? Sanjaya from 'American idol.' He was a guest. In fact, Republican leaders made Alberto Gonzales sit next to Sanjaya as kind of a hint that maybe it was time to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the good news -- this kid is very -- we had him here last week. Very nice kid, Sanjaya. And he's already got a new job. You see his new gig? He's been hired by the John Edwards campaign as a hair consultant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say John Edwards spends too much time on his appearance, but you know what his secret code name is? Do you know? Ryan Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new ABC/'Washington Post' presidential poll, in just the last two months, presidential candidate Joe Biden moved from 1% to 2%. You what I think? I think he's peaking too early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news, former Russian President Boris 'Buy Me A Drink' Yeltsin has passed away. ... They waited eight hours to make the official announcement, to make sure he just wasn't passed out drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But very nice, I understand his memorial will be an eternal flaming Jell-O shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about the Northwest pilot? This is unbelievable to me. This story just amazes me. Last week, a Northwest pilot was found driving under the influence of cocaine on the wrong side of the highway! Huh? Remember the old days? When a crack pilot was a good thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Wal-Mart announced they're going to open health care clinics in all their stores. They're promoting this as a way for Americans to get cheaper prescription drugs. Don't we have a source for that already? It's called Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a worldwide survey, what group of people worldwide are the most sexually satisfied? Which ones? Austrians. Austrians are the most sexually satisfied people in the world. In fact, when George Bush heard about it, he said 'That's why it's called down under.' See, I don't think he understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody have allergies. A lot of folks have allergies. It's the allergy season and it so bad here in New York City that the crack dealers now have started selling antihistamines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the pollen is unusually bad this year. As a matter of fact, Al Gore is already...working on a documentary on global sneezing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's big news coming out of Washington D.C. President Bush is standing by Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. Bush says Gonzalez is an honorable man and you know what that means. George is drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the price of gasoline continues to rise here in Los Angeles -- $3.70 a gallon. It's unbelievable. Highest in the nation. In fact, I saw John Edwards driving a Prius to get a $400 haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got myself a new computer this week. I got the Alberto Gonzales Dell computer. Have you seen this one? It works great. It destroys your e-mails and has no memory. But other than that, it's a fantastic unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, seriously. While almost everybody in Washington is still calling for Gonzales to resign, President Bush said Gonzales' testimony last week increased his confidence in him. Yeah. Bush said he had no idea Gonzales could lie like that.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Cheney was impressed! 'I can't believe it. The guy is good! He didn't squeal!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Just a couple of hours ago, congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney, yeah. You know what that means, if Dick Cheney were impeached? You know what would happen? George Bush will become acting president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says his fellow Democrats in Congress will pass a bill to start pulling our troops out of Iraq on October 1st. He said October 1st is the day. But Reid says he won't say what time of day because he doesn't want to tip off al Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a speech in New York City, Hillary Clinton said when she gets to the White House in 2009 -- this is what she said. She said, 'When I get to the White House in 2009,' she says she is 'afraid to see what she's going to find under the rug at the Oval Office.' You know, I don't think Clintons are the best people to talk about the rug in the Oval Office, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news ? I'm sure you've heard by now. Former president of Russia, Boris 'Buy Me A Drink' Yeltsin, has passed away. Left behind a bar tab of $3.2 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was a prison riot at Indianapolis today. Over 35 former congressmen were involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, you hear about is this? Huge riot at a prison in Indianapolis. I guess they heard about the Sheryl Crow toilet paper deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know about this? The singer Sheryl Crow had suggested to help the environment...we should only use one square of toilet paper for each trip to the bathroom. One square! People get more of that stuck under their shoe coming out of the bathroom!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, come on! Is that going to help the environment? It's not going to help your underpants, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what's going to happen now. Toilet paper companies are going to jump all over this. They'll start coming out with smaller rolls and calling it the new fun size.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech Sunday before a church group, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said he was going to make San Francisco a sanctuary for illegal immigrants so they can go there and not worry about being deported to their home country of Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is starting to get nasty. 'The New York Post' is reporting that contrary to what has previously been reported, the wife of former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey -- remember, he's divorcing her. He's gay now. He's gay now. But they're saying that she knew he was gay long before he announced it, and they even had known before their wedding. Actually, the tip-off, when he designed her gown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And seismologists at the University of California Berkeley have announced plans for an earthquake alert system that would give a 10-20 second warning before an earthquake hits. That's not enough for people to get to safety, but it's enough time for the insurance companies to cancel all the policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Spider-Man 3' is out. Not in the theaters. It's out on the streets of Beijing. It hasn't opened here yet. They already pirated the film and are selling it for $1 on the streets in China. You know what that means? ... 'Spider-Man 3' could hit Wal-Mart before it hits the theaters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much of Wal-Mart's goods are made in China, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And recently, kind of sad, Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston's divorce became final. And listen to this -- the Coast Guard says they seized 40,000 pounds of cocaine on a Panamanian freighter. How ironic is that? On the same day his divorce comes through, Bobby Brown's ship finally comes in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something exciting about New York City. It's a city of change, and listen to this; the mayor of New York City...Mayor Bloomberg. He's announced he wants to plant a million trees in New York City. A million trees in New York City. Yes! It's...It won't be too long before you can walk down Eighth Avenue and reach up and pick an orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. A million trees in New York City or as Donald Trump calls it; 'a blight on the landscape.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News from Washington, DC, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says despite criticism of his performance, he will not resign. He says in spite of the criticism, despite that, he will not resign. Ladies and gentlemen, it's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton -- are you excited about the 2008 presidential campaign? ... Hillary Clinton says if she's elected, she will name her husband, Bill Clinton, roving ambassador to the world. Former President Bill Clinton will be the roving ambassador to the world. Let me think about this. Bill Clinton traveling around the world without his wife...Um-- no, I can't see anything going wrong there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, maybe you didn't know this, but yesterday -- actually, today, President Bush is in town. Were you aware of the fact that George W. Bush was in town? He attended a big fund raiser on Park Avenue. It's part of his pet program 'No Cash Left Behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush met with the president of Peru. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Yeah, when the Peruvian president invited Bush to visit Machu Picchu, Bush said, 'Great. I love Pokemon. Machu Picchu's my favorite.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of politics, yesterday, Bill Clinton announced he'll be traveling to Russia to attend the funeral of former president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin. Yeah. At least, that's what he's telling Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;World-class entertainers gathered for a good cause, the annual White House Press Corps Correspondents Dinner. Last year, Stephen Colbert was the headliner. He may have been too funny for their liking. This year, they went for a slightly safer choice. They exhumed Rich Little to be the emcee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, now, when we finally need Dick Cheney to shoot an old man, he's nowhere to be found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sheryl Crow was at this dinner. I guess she was there to raise awareness about global warming. She has an interesting plan.&quot; She &quot;is encouraging people to only use one square of toilet paper when they go to the bathroom. So, in other words, don't ever shake Sheryl Crow's hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This explains why Lance Armstrong never let her sit on his bicycle seat.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sheryl Crow is here tonight. She's not on this show. She's over by the restrooms, making sure you just use one sheet of toilet paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you've heard this story by now. Sheryl Crow wants us to use less toilet paper to help the environment. In fact, today, gas stations around the country now claim the reason there's no paper in the restroom ? they're going green.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I've got to confess, earlier today, I used two squares of toilet paper. But afterwards, I planted a tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in other news, President Bush sent out an e-mail today asking people to send money to the Republican Party. How come those e-mails never get deleted?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it's now time for a new segment we call 'This Is Your President At Work.' I think the tape speaks for itself.&quot; Leno then played footage of the President dancing at the White House's Malaria Awareness Day event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate Tom Vilsack announced this week he will now endorse Hillary Clinton for president. And when Hillary heard the news, she said, 'Who is Tom Vilsack?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Edwards, he took a lot of heat for spending $400 on his haircut, now fighting back. He now says haircuts do not change who he is. Edwards said today -- this is the actual quote -- he said, 'My whole life has been standing up for people who have no voice.' In fact, you know who he's representing now? Sanjaya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to presidential candidate Joe Biden who has increased his poll numbers from 1% to 2%! Well, I bet there were some celebrations in those campaign headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the margin of error is, what, 3%, right? I mean, when your poll numbers are not bigger than the margin of error, you shouldn't be celebrating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yahoo announced they're going to host the first-ever online presidential debate&quot; later this year. Why &quot;Yahoo!? Why not eBay? Wouldn't that make more sense? I mean, our candidates end up going to the highest bidder anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Prime Minister Tony Blair said that bad drivers kill more people and are a bigger threat to the world than war and disease. In fact, I read that in the paper this morning in the car as I was driving to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Rosie O'Donnell Is Leaving &quot;The View&quot;: &quot;10. Couldn't maintain rigorous one-hour-a-day work schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It's been awkward ever since she threw Joy Behar through a plate glass window. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you realize this? President Bush sneaked into town yesterday. Were you aware of that? Yeah. He --this is a dramatic and exciting. He landed his helicopter right in Central Park and security was very tight. He stepped out of the helicopter and Cheney covered him with his shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news is Bush's trip to New York City was successful. He got Rosie to step down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about 'The View'? Do you believe the turnover at that show? My God, it makes the Iraqi government look stable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news. New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is busy. He says he wants to copy an antipoverty program that's currently used in Mexico, use it here. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, Mexico has a great antipoverty program ? it's called a bus ticket to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else is going on? Of course, President Bush is busy. Later this week, President Bush will meet with the prime minister of Japan. Yeah. Or as President Bush calls him, 'Mr. Miagi.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey's ex-wife says in her new book that McGreevey is not really homosexual. Yeah. Yeah. He says he's homosexual. She's saying, no, he's not really homosexual. Yeah. McGreevey was furious and said, 'How many guys do you have to screw to get your wife to call you gay?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, bigger than the war, Rosie O'Donnell announced her reign of terror is over at 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was on 'Pimp My Ride' this weekend,&quot; where the show's crew &quot;eco-pimped&quot; a &quot;1965 Chevy Impala.&quot; Kimmel showed footage of the Governor being told the interior of the car was made from hemp, to which he jokingly replied, &quot;I signed a bill to outlaw hemp. How can do you this to me? ... Because the next thing you know, they rip off material from the seat, and they smoke it&quot; and &quot;you can't have them do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our governor wasn't the only one looking silly for a good cause. Today, President Bush commemorated Malaria Awareness Day at the White House today by&quot; dancing. Kimmel showed the President dancing, adding, &quot;That' the malaria dance right there. What better way to -- I hate to say it, but I think somebody is drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday was National Malaria Awareness Day. And President Bush spoke about it. One embarrassing moment, when a reporter asked President Bush if he was aware of malaria, and Bush said, 'Of course, I am. She's Donald Trump's wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tonight was the first Democratic presidential debate,&quot; which &quot;was only on MSNBC. And the projected winner -- anybody with CNN or Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney this week. Yeah. Actually -- the local pundits say Dennis Kucinich is that rare candidate capable of waging...two hopeless campaigns at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's good news for Joe Biden. Support for his presidential campaign has risen from 1% to 2%. Do those sound like presidential numbers? 2%? Doesn't that sound more like low fat milk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the FDA said today there is no evidence that marijuana treats any disease. There's no evidence. There is no evidence HMOs treat any disease either, but they don't ban those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Astronomers say they have now discovered the existence of an earthlike planet with an atmosphere that could sustain life that's nearly 120 trillion miles away from us, in deep space. And here's the amazing part. It already has three Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say a year on this planet only lasts 13 days -- 13 days. What a nightmare for guys. That means it'd be Valentine's Day every two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the nice thing about having a planet where a year is only 13 days -- if you elect somebody president, and it's the wrong guy, after four months, he's out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rosie O'Donnell, huh? She has left 'The View' and is rumored to be hiding in the mountainous region of Afghanistan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they had tonight was one of those presidential debates. We're talking about the campaign now for 2008, November of 2008. They already, earlier tonight, had a Democratic presidential debate. And the thing got off to a rocky start. It was late getting off. Here's the problem ? it's guy at the door didn't recognize Dennis Kucinich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the debate? It was really weird that John Edwards, after his rebuttal, he demanded two minutes for conditioner.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's kind of a sad thing. Yesterday, down in Washington, D.C., was Malaria Awareness Day. And here's the sad part. Today, a confused President Bush sent 20,000 troops to Malaria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're aware of this, but the first Democratic presidential debate was held earlier tonight.&quot; It was &quot;big event, and it featured Senator Hillary Clinton facing off against seven men. That's right, yeah. Or as Bill Clinton calls it, the worst porn movie plot ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Bush visited a school in New York City, and before his visit, the city filled in all the potholes near the school. Yeah. Not only that, before the President's visit, the school hid all the sharp objects and covered the electric sockets with plastic protectors. Safety first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, eight Democratic presidential candidates squared off in the very first presidential debate. Anybody watch it? No, nobody. Nobody watched. See, we need to make it more like 'American Idol.' Each week, we vote another one off. You know what I'm saying? Make it interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to people who watched the debate last night, the big winner, apparently, was the Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Joe Biden looked pretty good. He was good. In fact, Joe's popularity has gone from 1% to 2% last week to 3% today. Do you realize at this rate, he could win the nomination by the year 2032?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...John Edwards apologized for his $400 haircut. He said it was a mistake, especially in the back, where they didn't feather it right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and did you -- did you see Dennis Kucinich and Hillary Clinton talking after the debate? Did you see them together? They looked like Potsie and Mr. Cunningham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, they're all talking about the environment. That's the issue -- the environment. Of all of the candidates in the debate, not one of them took a commercial flight or even shared a jet to help cut down on fuel and emissions. They each took their own separate jet plane to get there. Oh, then they said this way, the breeze would cool the Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'The Wall Street Journal,' of course, in a new Harris Poll shows that President Bush's approval rating [is] at an all-time low of just 28%. In fact, it is so bad that Alberto Gonzales said he's thinking about resigning just so he doesn't have to be seen standing with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? The government collected a record $48.7 billion in tax receipts in just one day. And that's just back taxes from Wesley Snipes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the marijuana being sold in America today is stronger than ever. It's actually 10% stronger than the marijuana sold just five years ago. See, this is why Americans are 10% fatter. It's all the munchies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why Oreos had to introduce the Double Stuff Oreos, just to keep up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Arbor Day. Down at the White House, a confused George W. Bush planted an Easter egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, celebrity birthday. Here's a celebrity birthday. Tomorrow, Saddam Hussein, 70 years old. Saddam Hussein would have been 70 years old tomorrow. And if you're looking for a gift, he could really use an air conditioner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton says if she is elected president, she'll use Bill Clinton as an ambassador because -- this is a quote ? she 'can't think of a better cheerleader for America.' That's right, yeah. Yes, to which Bill Clinton said, 'I can think of 20, and I have their phone numbers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I've got to mention this. In an effort to help the environment, Sheryl Crow has proposed using only one square of toilet paper when going to the bathroom. That's what she says, yeah, one square. In a related story, don't ever shake hands with Sheryl Crow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first debate last night between the eight Democratic presidential candidates. And tonight, your votes were tabulated. And Dennis Kucinich, you are going home. He has been voted off. That's right. If only it worked like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And people are still talking about the big Democratic debate they had last week. You know, they were originally supposed to have the debate on Fox, but the candidates decided against going on Fox, because Fox was unfair. Yeah. Then they chose MSNBC, which is unwatched. So between -- so unfair or unwatched, they didn't know which way to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans have their big debate this week at Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. The debate, of course, between the two sides of the Republican Party -- the 'haves' and 'really haves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Republicans want to see how they stack up against George W. Bush. It's like a very special edition of 'Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's my favorite story. I love this story. The Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias, 65-year-old married guy, who, for years, was President Bush's person in charge of promoting abstinence -- this guy's job was to go around and promote abstinence -- has resigned after he admitted he hired women from a Washington, D.C. escort service. Yeah. But he said he only used the women for massages. Oh, shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big question isn't if we believe him or not or whether even President Bush believes him -- does Mrs. Tobias believe him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massages. Any women buy this story? 'Honey, my neck's a little sore. You know, I'm gonna go downtown and get a hooker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And these were $300 an hour prostitutes -- $300 an hour -- which is pretty amazing when you realize John Edwards is paying $400, and all he got was a haircut. So that's not bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. And of course, when the White House heard about this scandal, they were relieved. Finally, a Republican caught in a sex scandal with a woman. Whew! Thank God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Mark Foley, thank you very much!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she's an adult!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Georgetown branch of the Washington, DC Public Library caught on fire today. The library caught on fire. The White House said at no time was President Bush in any danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the -- the former CIA chief -- did you see? He was on '60 Minutes' yesterday. George Tenet. He's got a new book that came out. In this book, he criticizes the Bush Administration's handling of the events leading up to the Iraq war. This is a new book. It just came out today. It's called George Tenet's 'Trying To Save My Own Ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and -- oh, I guess you heard about this -- Prince Harry is -- you know, he's in the military over there in Britain, and he says he wants to go to Iraq to fight. He says he wants to go to fight. But the British newspapers say, you know, when he gets there, he may be ordered to serve behind a desk. So today, former President Bill Clinton called him and said, 'You know, sitting behind a desk is not that bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was on this day -- it was on this day in 1971, Amtrak began their train service. Yeah. To commemorate the occasion, Amtrak officials wheeled out a giant cake and then rolled it down an embankment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the big sex scandal in Washington D.C.? Here's what was happening. The politicians apparently are visiting prostitutes. And, actually, one girl was paid with a new dam in her home state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's good news. The feds have arrested the madam who was in charge of the ring of prostitutes. No word yet on Osama, but they got the madam!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Former CIA Director George Tenet has written a tell-all book. You folks aware of this? President Bush has not read the book yet. Well, boy, there is a surprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But George Tenet is hot. And he's everywhere promoting the book. Last night, he was on '60 Minutes.' ... This is fascinating and a little scary. Tenet believes there are still weapons of mass destruction on 'The View.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Francisco's terrific. It's a unique place. It's the only city in the world where marijuana is legal, but plastic bags are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone here though is so nice and welcoming. True story, even Mayor Gavin Newsom sent me flowers. Isn't that nice? Nice? Yeah. Yeah, when I tried to thank him, he said, 'They're for your wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's 'Hookergate' in Washington. ... This woman named 'Miss Julia'...ran a high-class prostitution ring in Washington, DC, and she is releasing the names of her clients. Look, yeah, shock and awe, I'll bet there's shock and awe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the Bush Administration officials, Randall Tobias, he's already resigned because of the scandal. It's starting to look like GOP stands for 'Gittin it on with a Prostitute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair, though, to be fair, scandals like this are nonpartisan. I mean, the Democrats are the 'Donkey Party.' Don't even ask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why anybody is surprised by male politicians getting involved with prostitutes. Everybody knows men make stupid decisions when it comes to sex. It not because they are Republicans or Democrats, it is because they are men. It is what we do. It is true. You don't hear about Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice going nuts in Vegas with a male stripper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Usually when you see a crowd like this in L.A., they're protesting immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, thousands of immigrant students cut class to protest how tough our immigration policies are. You know, if our immigration policies are so tough, how come we have thousands of immigrant students?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, do you know that we deported over 250,000 illegal immigrants from this country last year? And today at the rally, they said they are all glad to be back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's what makes this country great. You know what I'm saying? The fact that thousands of Mexican people march in the state with an Austrian governor waving American flags made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Israel, a government commission has criticized Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for failing to use good judgment, responsibility and caution when going to war with Lebanon. They said he rushed into war without having a comprehensive plan. Well, thank God nothing like that could happen in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, all the Republican candidates will be coming to California -- I guess it's Thursday -- to debate each other at the Reagan Library. The winner will then be selected by Exxon Mobil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fidel Castro was a no-show at the May Day parade in Havana today. He didn't show up. I guess he was marching in the illegal immigrant rally in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the latest scandal in Washington. I love this scandal. They say on '20/20' this week, the D.C. madam -- you heard about this woman? She is going to list names of famous Republicans who used her female escort services. See, that shows you the fundamental philosophical differences between the two parties. You know what I'm saying? Bush Republicans believe in having...the private sector provide sex for profit, whereas Clinton Democrats believe it should be a big giveaway program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you hear about this guy? A man named Randall Tobias, who was the deputy secretary of State, resigned after it was revealed he used this woman's services, yeah. Tobias, who was married, claimed he just got a massage. He just got a massage and did not have sex. Well, he can forget about getting either one of those at home ever again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Tobias was the guy who Bush put in charge of promoting abstinence...and chastity, in places like the Mideast, yeah. He was also the CEO of the company that makes Cialis. No, that's true. That's true. So it sounds like he was caught between a rack and a hard place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs Fidel Castro Is Fully Recovered: &quot;10. Every morning, 45 minutes of torture, followed by 45 minutes of cardio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. His coat is shiny and his nose is wet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Organized six guerillas to rob Mick Jagger's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. His 1959 Chrysler Imperial was spotted at IHOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In NFL draft, was picked before Brady Quinn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Recently pimped out his MySpace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Returned to favorite hobbies of his youth like tennis and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Tried to get on 'Late Show Impressionist Week 2' by doing Pacino in 'Scarface.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He's put on 30 pounds, he's wearing fatigues, he's spewing propaganda...no, that's Rosie O'Donnell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hasn't had a 'Cuban missile crisis' in some time, if you know what I mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an important anniversary -- four years ago today, ladies and gentlemen, President Bush gave his Iraq victory speech in front of the 'mission accomplished' banner. Well, I'm glad that's all behind us. Let's get on to something else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you, if you're down there in Washington and if you're a politician and you work in the government, whoo, it's like one scandal after another. You hear about the big Washington, D.C. madam. She was running a call girl operation, and a lot of congressmen and senators, they think, high-ranking politicians, were visiting the prostitutes. It's just crazy. One girl actually got paid with a new highway project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know. I mean, think about it -- politicians having sex with prostitutes? What's the matter, all of a sudden, congressional pages aren't good enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about this Washington sex scandal. One politician -- this is a little sick, by the way -- he would go to the place and had two girls and he liked to be tied up and they would filibuster him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that the mayor of San Francisco is planning to make this city a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. Yeah. As a result, San Francisco is changing its name to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is the latest on the freeway. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inspected the freeway collapse yesterday. And afterwards, Arnold said he will do everything he can to 'minimize the impact on commuters.' Yeah. Of course, when Arnold said it, it sounded like, 'Minnie Mouse is packing my kimono.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to Los Angeles, named today by the American Lung Association, the number one most-polluted city in the United States. Thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's an honor just to be nominated, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we'd like to thank God, our agent, and every one of Frankie Muniz's 27 cars for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;L.A. was named most polluted. ... I don't think of us as the most polluted cities in the United States. I think of us as one of the least polluted cities in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All across the country today,&quot; there were &quot;immigration protests.&quot; I &quot;always think when I see that...is this a good idea, because if you're an illegal immigrant, the last thing you should be doing is drawing attention to yourself. The immigration people are going to know where to find you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is May 2nd, or as President Bush calls it, 'Veto de Mayo Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you probably heard, President Bush has vetoed Congress' Iraqi bill, so two branches of government are now battling, you see. See, this is why President Bush wanted a monarchy, so he wouldn't have these kinds of problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you all know who Nancy Pelosi is, right? You know who she is? She's the second most powerful woman in the country, right behind the DC madam.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, the Washington, DC Madam has threatened to release more names of Washington politicians who are her customers. One has already stepped down, Randall Tobias, who is the deputy secretary of State. He claimed he didn't get sex from any of the escorts, he just got a massage. Now, if you just got a massage without sex, would that be considered a sad ending?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the DC Madam says another member of the White House will be named very soon. See, this proves once again members of the Bush Administration don't know when it's time to pull out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, it turns out this Washington madam went to law school. She's not dumb. She went to law school but never finished. Yeah, never finished law school, although she decided to become a whore anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, there were huge immigration rallies all across the country. In fact, there were so many, most Wal-Marts were down to just one clerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were watching on TV, you saw the demonstrators singing 'We Shall Overcome' and the Mexico demonstrators singing 'We Shall Come Over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And proponents of immigrants claim they are willing to do the work that others here won't do, you know, like pass an immigration bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, at one point out here in Los Angeles, the protest got out of hand and police fired rubber bullets at the protesters. You know what Phil Spector calls rubber bullets? Safe sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The New York Post,' Hillary Clinton used three private jets in a single day in a campaign swing through South Carolina. Three different private jets. And today, she was officially named a Hollywood environmentalist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was interesting, when the Associated Press asked all of the candidates what their dream job would be if they couldn't be president, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said his dream job would be center fielder for the New York Yankees, Joe Biden said he wanted to be an architect, and Dennis Kucinich said his dream was to grow up and one day become a real, live boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the president of Iran has been accused of public indecency for kissing the hand of an elderly woman who used to be his schoolteacher. So, he denies the Holocaust, wants to destroy Israel, Iranians have no problem with that. Kiss an elderly woman on the hand, 'Pervert, we kill you!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's hope they never find out what students do with their teachers in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gasoline prices going higher and higher. Almost $4 a gallon here in Los Angeles. Unheard of. It's amazing, isn't it? Yeah, in fact gas is so high, today John Edwards spent $500 on gas driving to get a $400 haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In Ronald Reagan's Personal Diary: &quot;10. Sold arms to Iran, and hair dye to Mike Wallace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Never forgave Michael Jackson for stealing 'The Moonwalk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Contemplated resigning presidency to run off to Mexico with Valerie Bertinelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Began each morning by taking a leak in the Rose Garden -- that doesn't seem right!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the early 80s he caught a severe case of Pac Man fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Had many conversations with Robert Klein about how Letterman didn't deserve a show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In addition to 'Reaganomics,' coined phrase 'Where my dawgs at?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. More than once, he tried to rub the spot off Gorbachev's head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. During his first two years as President, he thought he was making a movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know there's a big scandal going on down in Washington DC, the big prostitution ring down there. Politicians were actually paying for sex. Listen to this. One girl got paid with a military base in her home state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this ring of prostitutes, they apparently had a very elite group of clients, very important people. As a matter of fact, one girl was sent to the Lincoln Memorial to give Abe a lap dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But politicians were paying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars for sex. I thought, well, I guess that's better than spending that kind of money on a haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I guess by now you know that President Bush vetoed the Iraq troop withdrawal bill. Yeah. He said...it would turn the country into a cauldron of chaos. And you'd hate to see Iraq become unstable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Francisco has several nicknames -- the Golden Gate City, the City by the Bay, or my favorite, LA with Books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, San Francisco Giant Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda was arrested after he was pulled over for speeding and found with marijuana and what appeared to be... cocaine, that's right. Yeah, Cepeda insists it was medical marijuana and medical cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little fun fact for you. This theater was built in 1926. That's right, yeah. Back then...in San Francisco, a cup of coffee cost a nickel, cable car cost a dime, and the rent for a studio apartment was only $4,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The San Francisco mayor's race is heating up. There are now 13 candidates running against Gavin Newsom. That's right, yeah. Yeah, Mayor Newsom said, 'I'm looking forward to debating all the candidates and nailing their wives.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After not sending anyone home last week, 'American Idol' gave a heave and a ho to two karaoke singers tonight. President Bush taped a message for the show last night. He opposes the plan to pull two contestants out. He says it could cause chaos to the region and prefers sending more contestants in. They didn't listen to him.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight was the big Republican debate. Ten white guys. They called it the 'Thrilla in Vanilla,' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it looked like a meeting of the Hair Club for Men, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think GOP stands for 'Gray, Old and Pale,' if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting -- during the Democratic debate last week, all the candidates talked about conserving energy. They're like, you know, 'Keep turning the thermostat down in the winter, using low energy bulbs, turning off lights, using less gas.' You know, it made me realize -- my dad was, like, the first environmentalist. He'd walk around and go, 'Turn down that -- turn off those lights! Turn that crap down!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about the DC Madam. You know about this woman? Apparently, for an extra $50, she would be the ACDC Madam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now, it looks like a lot of politicians' careers will be ruined when this Washington madam releases the names on her client list. President Bush's deputy secretary of State, a man named Randall Tobias, has already resigned because he was a customer -- but he claims, oh, he just got a massage, but no sex. A massage but no sex. I think that was called the 'married guy's special.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but the DC Madam says when she releases these names, she's not doing it for political reasons. That's what she said. She says she does not have a political bone in her body. At least not today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'Men's Health' magazine, one out of five grown adult men still watch Saturday morning cartoons every week. To which president Bush went, 'See!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And researchers at UCLA have announced that drinking coffee can prevent diabetes and certain types of cancer. Oh, man. You thought health care was expensive before -- wait 'til people at Starbucks get involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the Republican presidential debate? That's right. There are 10 Republicans who want to be President of the United States. Did you see them? They look like guys waiting to tee off at a restricted country club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the kind of thing I can't get enough of -- there&quot; a brand new book out, Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says she has a crush on President Bush. Well, sure, who doesn't?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you been this, but right now, Washington, D.C., our nation's capital, is in the grips, in the throes of a big sex scandal, big prostitution ring sex scandal, high-powered politicians going to visit prostitutes. Were you aware of this? ... The call girl agency had a slogan down there in Washington, D.C. And the slogan was, 'We take care of you below the Beltway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole San Francisco lifestyle is really starting to rub off on me. Yeah. Today, today I -- yeah, I'm becoming more like the people of San Francisco. Today, I realized I was wearing a suit and tie, so I gave myself the finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to say, everybody has been so nice to me here in San Francisco. True story -- earlier, earlier today, Mayor Gavin Newsom invited me over for a sandwich. Yeah, yeah. After that -- after that, we had lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican presidential debate was held tonight in California, and ten candidates took part. That's right, political experts say that the 10 Republican candidates represented all races, creeds and colors of rich white men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, medical marijuana is legal in San Francisco. It's legal here. It's a good thing. Yeah. Yeah, and that's a -- that's a good thing, because I was watching our audience line up for tonight's show, and apparently, there's been a huge outbreak of glaucoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, the first of the big presidential debates, the Republicans held their first debate. John McCain said if elected, he was going to continue the war. Rudy Giuliani said if elected, he'd focus on tax...reform. ... Mike Huckabee said if elected, he'd be amazed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate made much clearer who the republican nominee will be. It's going to be a grumpy old white guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, another grumpy old white guy. She said -- she said ? I'm just kidding. ... She said her favorite TV show is 'American idol.' Of course, Bill's favorite show is 'Wife Swap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a hotel in California. I don&quot; know if you heard about this. It is taking the Bible out of its nightstands and replacing it with Al Gore's book 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Not because they have an environmentalist agenda. They just want to help their guests get to sleep at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all watch the Republican debate last night? Nobody watched that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I even tried to TiVo it, but my TiVo said, 'Nah, not interested, no.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so dull, people at home were actually turning over to see what was on NBC.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the candidates came prepared. Rudy Giuliani, of course, brought his energy. McCain brought his experience. Mitt Romney brought his charm. Mike Huckabee brought his nametag so people would know...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, my favorite part of the debate was when Chris Matthews asked, 'Who does not believe in evolution?' And Sam Brownback, Mike Huckabee and Tom Tancredo all raised their paw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they said they do not believe in evolution. Then they said the biggest threat to America -- religious radicals living in the Dark Ages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? In the Reagan Library last night, President Bush's name was only mentioned once, only one time during the entire debate. You know, but to be fair, you don't often hear Bush's named mentioned in libraries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of Barack Obama's immense popularity, he's already been given Secret Service protection. It's a whole group already. And poor Joe Biden, you see what he got? Yeah. Can of mace and a pen knife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a legal secretary at Washington's most prominent and well-connected law firm, Akin Gump Strauss ? that's the name of the law firm -- has been suspended after telling her bosses she secretly worked at night for the escort service run by the DC Madam. Isn't that unbelievable? Yeah. They're not releasing her name because the family would be embarrassed. And the whole world would know she worked for a bunch of lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tomorrow, of course, Cinco de Mayo, which in Spanish means, 'they outnumber us 5-1.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how embarrassing is this? 'Time' magazine released its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. President Bush is not on the list. Isn't that amazing? However, supermodel Kate Moss is! And here's the scary part -- Kate Moss actually has a better plan for getting us out of Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something I learned today. I guess this happened because the president of Iran kissed that woman's hand. Did you know in Iran it's forbidden for a male and a female to have any physical contact unless they are related? You know, like Kentucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Queen Elizabeth is visiting the United States. Today, she visited Jamestown. When President Bush heard the Queen was going to Jamestown, he said, 'Oh, my God, don't drink the Kool-Aid!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Surprises In 'Spider-Man 3': 8. Spider-Man's secret identity is leaked by Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night in this state of California, the first Republican debate was held at the Reagan Presidential Library and...the candidates tried to distance themselves from President Bush. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, the first step in distancing yourself from President Bush is appearing at a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, the Barry Bonds home run saga has generated some controversy. It's such a compelling story, that our network, NBC, has already hard at work on a baseball made-for-TV movie. That's right. The casting for this baseball movie is top secret, but I managed to get a sneak peek. I'm going to share the casting with you right now. ... The man who initiated the investigation of steroid use in professional sports, President George W. Bush, will be played by Patrick from 'SpongeBob.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first debate between Republican candidates for president was last night. Not far from here. Ten candidates debated. The Republican Party has had a difficult time because not too many people like President Bush. His approval rating is down in the 30s. Not percent, by the way, but people. Plus or minus two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot of talk about not just Iraq, but Iran last night. Their crazy president, he always wears the Members Only jacket. He was on TV...this morning, I think. He threatened to break the leg of any nation that attacks him. I have to be honest, it doesn't sound so terrible. You break a leg, you get a cast, maybe it itches a little, everybody signs it and it's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DC Madam released her client list. Oh, yeah. There haven't been this many nervous lawyers in Washington since Dick Cheney renewed his hunting license.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Street Sense. Street Sense won the Kentucky Derby over the weekend. Very exciting, yeah. Came from 19th place to win -- 19th place. So there's still hope for Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard this. A big investigation going on here in Los Angeles when there was a scuffle between police and immigration protesters last week. It was a huge story here in LA at one point, police tried to disperse the crowd using pepper spray. But they realized the crowd was immune to that. And they had to switch to the much hotter jalapeno spray, which, of course, is illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched the Republican debate the other night -- last week, rather? ... There were ten candidates, ten! You know what you call that many Republicans in one room? A board meeting! Okay, that's a board meeting. It wasn't a debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and ABC...had their big expose on Friday on '20/20' about the DC Madam. It turned out to be nothing. They didn't name any names. And the DC Madam said -- this is interesting -- she said that a lot of hookers that worked for her were in their late 50s. She said those were the most popular ones, the ones in their late 50s. Especially when the Rolling Stones were in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, what do you think of this idea? The Department of Homeland Security says they are now looking into the possibility of using people's cell phones to warn and protect citizens in case of a biological or chemical attack. Like, if we were under attack, Homeland Security automatically would call you on your cell phone to tell you this. You know, you see how bad people drive on the freeway now when they are talking to friends on the phone. They are going 81 ? 'Hey, we're under attack!' 'What?' Is that a good idea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when reporters of the Associated Press recently asked some of the presidential candidates what their favorite reality shows were, Mitt Romney said 'American Idol.' Joe Biden said he didn't have a favorite show. And surprisingly, Rudy Giuliani picked 'Wife Swap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth, met with President Bush over the weekend. You know, I thought this was nice of President Bush. Did you hear what he did? He took the time to learn a little bit of English so he could speak with her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Queen was welcomed with a 21-gun salute. Well, 22 if you count Cheney's gun that went off accidentally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales -- remember, it looked like he was going to get fired? He got a promotion from President Bush. Did you hear his new title? Take a listen.&quot; President Bush: &quot;I am honored to be here with the Eternal General of the United States, mi amigo -- Alberto Gonzales.&quot; Leno: &quot;Did you hear his new job? He is now the 'Eternal General.' He's gone up. ... Yeah, quite a promotion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, Vice President Dick Cheney will be going to the Middle East to meet with the leader of Saudi Arabia. I understand he's a bit nervous. Well, sure, you're always a little jittery when you get called in by the boss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this, the Queen of England is in the United States. Were you aware of that? And earlier today she's down at the White House. And George Bush, my gosh, I wouldn't give this guy's troubles to a monkey on a rock. He gets confused and he went up to the Queen and he congratulated her on her Academy Award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the last time the Queen of England was in the United States was 1991, 1991. And an awful lot has changed since 1991, the last time she was here...back then, President Bush was fighting a war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, at the White House, President Bush met with Queen Elizabeth II. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Met with Queen Elizabeth II. Yeah, there was an awkward moment when Bush called her 'Queen Elizabeth the sequel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Washington Post' reports that Senator Hillary Clinton is trying to win the Democratic nomination by reaching out to women. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Oh, sure. When she does it, it's okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Mexico...a new world record was set when 18,000 Mexicans stripped off their clothes for a nude group photo. True story, yeah. Yeah, then they set another record for the most nude people to sneak across the Mexican border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is the big news today. The Queen of England...at the White House. She was at the White House. She was honored with a 21-gun salute. There she is, with Dick Cheney. You can say what you like about the Queen but she is a brave woman. If she attends a shooting event with Dick, come on.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't want to be walking around wearing a big feathery hat. It is hunting season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is probably safe. Cheney never actually hit the bird. What you don't want to do is look like a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House gave the Queen a white tie dinner. Very bad news for the President, because he uses his tie like a napkin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Record high&quot; gas prices &quot;all across the country. In fact, gas is so expensive here in Los Angeles, today I saw Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger carpooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I filled up my tank today, and you know where it says 'swipe credit card here'? It swiped my credit card -- took the whole card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, last night President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush hosted the Queen of England at a big state dinner. One embarrassing moment -- when the Queen told President Bush she'd been on the throne for over 55 years and Bush said, 'Try Metamucil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Queen Elizabeth gave President Bush a frosty look when he gave her a wink. Did you see that in the paper? President Bush winked at the Queen,&quot; and &quot;you don't do that. You're not supposed to give the Queen a wink. That is wrong. But Bush just gave a wink. Hey, she's lucky she wasn't there when Clinton was in office, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know who was also there at the big state dinner? Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. ... Actually, the President was going to invite Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, but he was afraid he might get the Queen pregnant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, we have Larry the Cable Guy on the show tonight. He was able to be with us here tonight, because the White House state dinner was last night. You know, had it been tonight, we would have lost him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a commencement speech over the weekend, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told students they should all get married. But he said, unlike Giuliani, don't go overboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much you folks paying for gas? Huh? Get ready -- $4 a gallon. This summer it could be $4 a gallon. Thank you. It's all part of President Bush's 'No Oil Company Left Behind' program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you excited about Queen Elizabeth being in the United States? And last night, at the White House, Queen Elizabeth was there and she met Barbara Bush, Queen Elizabeth and Barbara Bush. I think it was old bag night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British press is angry. They're claiming that President Bush disrespected the Queen because he accidentally suggested she was over 200 years old and then winked at her. ... Yeah...when President Bush noticed the Queen was annoyed, he said, 'Shake it off' and slapped her ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of presidents, this week, former President Bill Clinton wrote the clues for a 'New York Times' crossword puzzle,&quot; which &quot;explains why the clue for number nine down is, 'synonym for pain in the ass rhyming with millary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Hilton,&quot; who was sentenced to 45 days in jail for driving with a suspended, is &quot;starting an online petition asking&quot; Governor Schwarzenegger to pardon her. Assuming &quot;the petition doesn't work, and I think that's a safe assumption, Paris will arrive in jail on June 5th. In case that happens, we're also circulating a petition. We're asking Governor Schwarzenegger to declare June 5th 'Paris Hilton Is Going To Jail Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big hub-bub in Great Britain because President Bush winked at the Queen. I'm sure that's the first time the Queen has been winged at. As you can see here, she absolutely loved it. In the old days, that's the look queens gave you before you were beheaded.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a major fire going here in Los Angeles. It's still going on. In fact, the smoke was so thick this morning I couldn't see the smog coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, some good news. Just a few moments ago, the Mayor of Los Angeles went on TV to announce that the fire is now 50% under control, which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that the rest of L.A. is only about 30% under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush's approval rating dropped to an all-time&quot; low; &quot;well, here's my question -- is 28% still technically an approval rating? Isn't that kind of a disapproval rating at this point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made a couple of gaffes around the Queen the other day. He meant to say the Queen visited the White House in 1976. Instead, he said 1776. Then he made another huge gaffe when he asked the Queen how old her son-in-law Camilla was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there are no hard feelings. The Queen was quite a good sport about it. In fact, the Queen gave President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush a beautiful clock as a gift from the royal family. A clock. I guess the royal family figured they don't need a clock. None of them have jobs. They don't have to be anywhere, so it's not like...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Cheney made a surprise visit to Iraq today. Great, the one place we need him firing off his gun, he doesn't bring it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just goes over there and the price of oil went down. In fact, that's why Cheney's in the Mideast, to find out what went wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama's wife, Michelle Obama, has been out campaigning for her husband. And she praised her husband for having a moral compass. Yeah, yeah. In fact, Hillary Clinton called her and asked, 'Where I can get one of these moral compasses for Bill?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, what a beautiful day. Isn't it a lovely day today in New York City? It's a beautiful day, or as Al Gore calls it, 'the last gasp of a dying planet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Paris Hilton's fans have contacted Governor Schwarzenegger to ask for a pardon for Paris Hilton. And the reason they want the Governor to pardon Paris Hilton is because she brings beauty and excitement to their lives. You know there's a precedent for this. That's exactly why Ford pardoned Nixon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is on his tour of the Mideast. Over there, he's very popular. He's known as Lawrence of Arrhythmia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush hosted a state dinner in Queen Elizabeth's honor. And the guests included Trent Lott, Elisabeth Hasselbeck from 'The View' and the winning jockey from the Kentucky Derby. Yeah, which explains why the Queen was overheard saying, 'This party bites the big one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iran, President Ahmadinejad is apparently so unpopular that the parliament has voted to take away his powers and shorten his term. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'That lucky bastard. Sounds good to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All over the country, there's been crazy stuff going on. In the last 48 hours, there have been wildfires, floods, tornados; an earthquake. It's nuts. And I can't help but believe that this is God punishing us for imprisoning Paris Hilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you saw those horrible fires on the news. Just unbelievable. You know, in fact, L.A. -- we already have the most polluted air in the nation. Now, it's hickory smoke.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here in L.A., we have these fires so much, they get jaded by the fires. Like I'm coming in to work today, I saw a group of kids lying on a hill making soot angels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gasoline is closing in on $4 a gallon here in Los Angeles. And you know, I'll tell you, it's not just drivers that are affected. Today, I saw a gardener blowing leaves away with a hand fan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Paris Hilton sentenced to 45 days in jail. You know, she actually sent a...petition to Governor Schwarzenegger asking him to pardon her. Isn't that amazing? She knew who the Governor was. I'm stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 20% of teenagers say they would like to grow up to be President of the United States. ... So kids, remember, if you don't study, and all you do is party -- hey, it could happen for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about the guy who works at Circuit City&quot; that busted &quot;up a terrorist ring. Pretty good, huh? And I'm thinking, no wonder I can never get a salesman to help me pick out an answering machine. He's out chasing a Qaeda guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy's pretty good. Not only did he bust up the terror ring, he also sold them a bunch of crap they didn't need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prime Minister Tony Blair of England just announced that he will step down next month, which means that President Bush is going to lose his closest foreign ally. It's tough. Yeah, Bush was sad and said, 'Now the only foreign leader I can trust is Arnold Schwarzenegger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a group of Republican congressmen asked President Bush what his Plan B is if the current Iraq plan doesn't work. Yeah, the Plan B discussion was difficult for him because it involves two areas where he's extremely vulnerable -- Iraq and the alphabet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the presidential race heating up. This week, Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter revealed that he drives a Chevy Suburban with 274,000 miles on it. Yeah, despite all those miles, the Suburban still has a much better chance of making it to the '08 election than Duncan Hunter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when told that Prime Minister Tony Blair was stepping down...as Britain's leader, a confused President Bush said, 'Hey, wait a minute. If he's the leader of England, who is that old lady with the crown that was just here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President said today he would go along with Congress' request to establish benchmarks regarding Iraq. For example, the Iraqi government would have to show results by certain dates before they're given any more money. Forget Iraq. Why don't we try that here, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gas continues to rise all across the country,&quot; even in Pennsylvania. The &quot;Amish are now reporting a huge increase in horse and buggy jackings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart is reporting its worst sales in 28 years, yeah. Yeah, sales are so bad, well, they may have to let some illegals go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Hilton, it's like our darkest nightmare, Paris Hilton is going to prison, ladies and gentlemen. But, on the other hand, President Bush says that its proof we're winning the war against celebutants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news from England. You all heard about this? Yesterday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that he will step down next month.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the elections are heating up. In a recent interview, Senator John McCain says the last music he bought was the Beach Boys, while Mitt Romney says the last music he bought was Roy Orbison. Yeah, apparently McCain and Romney are both running for president in 1964.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart has announced that they are going to open health clinics in some of their stores. Wal-Mart health clinics, yeah. Wal-Mart's health clinics are for people who don't want to spend money on those fancy Kmart doctors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It's either 40 bucks for gas or roses, okay? 'Mom, which one you want, half a tank or a couple of roses?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is that? Oh, too many disasters! Yeah, yeah. Exactly. I think in California, the 'Good Hands' people are now the 'One Finger' people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the price of gasoline passed $4 a gallon in California. Isn't that unbelievable? In fact, gas is so expensive now, a lot of families are only planning summer trips within walking distance of their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush introduced plans to cut the nation's addiction to oil. And Dick Cheney, who's been on a trip in the Mideast, said, 'I can't leave that guy for two minutes, and he does something stupid like this!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This global warming is serious and at the summit they determined that we are in real trouble and our only hope&quot; is &quot;Spider-Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton was a speaker at the global warming summit. And he says that he has been very, very concerned about global warming. As a matter of fact, earlier this week, another chunk of ice fell off his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, in Virginia, President Bush attended some big event.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, speaking of the President, the other day, a group that researches ancestry announced that President Bush is a descendant of Pocahontas.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential campaign is heating up. Earlier today, Senator Barack Obama was endorsed by the mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That's right. Afterwards, Obama told the Newark mayor, 'Thanks, but do you mind keeping this between us?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the campaign, in a new video promoting Hillary Clinton's campaign, former President Clinton says -- this is a quote ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear this? The government in Iran has now forbidden men to trim their eyebrows or use hair gel. Yeah. Yeah, an Iran spokesperson said, 'It's not a religious issue. We just don't want our men to look like Ryan Seacrest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, gas is almost $4 and in Beverly Hills, it's over $4 a gallon. In fact, they're saying these price increases are being fuel by rumors. Shut up!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, today is supposed to be national Don't Buy Gasoline Day. We're supposed to refuse to buy gas to protest the high prices, which of course will be followed tomorrow by National Gas Stations Double the Price of Gas Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, 'USA Today' is reporting that the airlines are not going to increase ticket prices to compensate for rising fuel costs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Former President Bill Clinton did a video for his wife Hillary's presidential campaign. Although, Hillary is a little upset about it, because it turns out Bill did the video with Paris Hilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And plans are in the works for another 'Terminator' movie ? 'Terminator 4' -- but Arnold Schwarzenegger will not return as the Terminator.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm happy to report that Vice President Dick Cheney has returned to the Middle East and he certainly straightened that mess out. He...made a stop in Egypt on his way home. Apparently, Halliburton wants to rebuild the pyramids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of Iran has issued orders telling men that they are not allowed to wear ties to work. Yeah. Yeah, apparently, it's a little known fact that Prophet Mohammad was a turtleneck guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new video promoting Hillary Clinton's campaign, former President Clinton says there are a lot of things about Hillary that voters may not know. Yeah. Yeah, then he said, 'For instance, did you know that she has a smoking-hot assistant?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They all answered some tough questions. Rudy Giuliani had to answer for his position on abortion, and John McCain had to answer for his support of immigration reform, and Mike Huckabee had to answer the question, 'Who are you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Afghanistan announced they have killed the commander of the Taliban, a one-legged man named Mullah Dadullah. That's his name. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had another Republican candidate presidential debate last night. Did you see those guys? Did you see the Republican candidates? I mean, they looked like the evil law firm in a John Grisham movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently there are rumors coming out of Washington that Vice President Dick Cheney, when he was the CEO of Halliburton, he used to go visit prostitutes. This could explain why one girl was paid $2 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, I was thinking about this. Cheney, I mean, going to a prostitute. I mean, I can't believe a good- looking guy like that would ever have to pay for sex. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidential campaign well under way, the big '08 campaign. Last night, Fox News aired the second Republican presidential debate. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw it, but during last night's Republican debate, Mike Huckabee got a big laugh when he said that Congress has been spending money like John Edwards at a beauty salon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House and key members from both houses of Congress have come to an agreement on an immigration bill finally, which is good news. Now, people coming from Mexico can finally come to this country and no longer go through all that red tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under this new immigration deal, illegal aliens could become legal by paying a fine of $5,000. Where are they going to get that? The only aliens that can afford that are already starting for the Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards coming under fire. He said his working for a Wall Street hedge fund that caters to rich investors shouldn't overshadow his efforts on poverty. Edwards said he worked very hard to eliminate poverty -- especially his own -- but he worked very hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's the difference between Democrats and Republicans, right there. If you're a democrat and you work on Wall Street, well, you got some explaining to do. If you're a Republican, you get the nomination. See, a little bit different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said that he is willing to be the last man standing when it comes to supporting the war in Iraq. I think he already is pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And porn star Jenna Jameson has officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. So looks like Bill already callin' in all the favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A nature watchdog group says we have five years to fix global warming or face catastrophic consequences, like the possibility of another Al Gore movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a British army chief says that Prince Harry will not be sent to Iraq. Remember we said he was going? He is not gonna go to Iraq with his military unit because the threats are too great. That's got to be a real morale booster for his fellow soldiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The top Palestinian security officer has resigned. Has stepped down. Yep. He said he is now looking forward to throwing rocks at Jews in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Texas Legislature has passed a bill that will essentially fine couples 60 bucks if you don't get counseling before you get a a marriage license. In Texas, they want you to take eight hours of counseling before you get a marriage license. Great, something else to argue about before the wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Republicans in Texas think you need a course on how to keep a marriage together? Who is going to teach it? Rudy Giuliani? Newt Gingrich?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Oregon Senate has approved a bill that will allow ex-prostitutes to become teachers. I believe the name of the bill is 'Every Child Gets Some Behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm on the new Exxon-Mobil diet. Anybody on this? Where you spend so much money on gasoline, you can't afford food?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here's news from Washington, DC. We now have a new war czar, a new war czar. Yes, he was appointed by President Bush, so what could go wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's been endorsed by porn star Jenna Jameson. Jameson's exact quote was, 'I'm endorsing Hillary, so tell Bill Clinton to stop bothering me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today at the White House, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair held their last joint press conference. Yeah. In other words, it was the last time they played Christopher Robin and Pooh.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show'! And happy TGIF. You know what TGIF stands for, anybody know? No? The Green Card Is Five Grand. That's what it stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess part of this new immigration bill requires the head of the household to be sent home. He has to go back to his home country. See, some say it would be cruel to take a hard-working person reaching for the American dream and send them home, but, hey, 'American Idol' does it every week!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they are going to have to pay a $5,000 fine. Where are these people going to get five grand? Huh? I mean, what are the chances Wal-Mart is going to give them a raise? That's not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Associated Press says that many of the Mexican people in Mexico are against this new immigration bill. Oh, man, let's hope they don't boycott coming here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of money, our new budget is a record&quot; $2.9 trillion. Here's &quot;my question. Is that still technically a budget? Really? Spending close to $3 trillion a year. Is that living within your means?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's Friday, of course, which means Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani says he believes in a woman's right to choose, and he has shown it time and time again. When it comes to choosing women, he likes to have a choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this? The head of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz, resigned after getting in trouble for promoting his girlfriend and then giving her a huge raise. And, of course, this is a worse tragedy for the girlfriend. Because now, it means she slept with this guy for nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man. The price of gasoline is getting crazier in California. Close to $4 a gallon in a lot of places. It's unbelievable, isn't it? In Beverly Hills, a lot of gas stations are taking advantage, $5 a gallon. Oh, yeah, but they're selling it as 'free-range organic gas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed the Taliban's top commander. Did you hear about this in Afghanistan? Yeah, they killed him. But, you know, it's going be nice for Saddam Hussein to have help shoveling coal into the furnace of hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Shrek 3' opened earlier today. ... You know, the story of Shrek, though,&quot; is that &quot;he's a beastly ogre, he's a giant and he marries into a family of royalty,&quot; and &quot;then eventually goes on to become Governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday...at the White House, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair held their last joint press conference. Yeah. President Bush says he's going to miss listening to Tony Blair, because when he closes his eyes, Blair sounds just like C-3PO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't aware of this, but the area around Florida is suffering from a severe drought that has gone on for 18 months; 18 months, yeah. In fact, the water level is now so low, Cubans are walking to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in New York, a school teacher received a box without a return address that contained 12 pounds of marijuana. Yeah. Afterwards, the teacher said, 'It sure beats the hell out of an apple.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Shrek 3' incorporates bits of Arthurian legend. You know, the legend of King Arthur. You know, that was the one where...he pulls the sword ? 'Whomsoever pulls this sword from this stone shall be the rightful king of England.' What kind of system of government is that? Really, when you think about it. Apparently the English, though, whoever is the biggest and the strongest gets to govern the country. That is ridiculous! By that logic, the Governor of California would be -- oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow, what a...happy crowd. You obviously didn't buy gasoline today, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas just keeps going up. Gas is so expensive today I saw Jimmy Carter and President Bush carpooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it is getting nasty in Washington. This never happens, but President Carter called President Bush the worst president in history. And then the White House said, 'No, Jimmy Carter was irrelevant.' Even Simon Cowell and Ryan are going, 'Hey, why all the insults? Take it easy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Jimmy Carter actually said George W. Bush is the worst in history. And then Bush said, 'No, that's not true.' He said he was the worst in math and English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, ex-presidents are not supposed to insult the current ? it's just one of those unwritten rules. Well, now Jimmy Carter's backtracking. He now says no, no, his comments were misinterpreted. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure the phrase 'the worst in history' can be taken any number of ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I don't know if it's unfair. Well, you see, people -- see, under President Bush, sure, we have the war in Iraq. But see, the young kids, they don't remember. Under President Carter, we had something far worse -- disco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you may have heard, all the candidates have made their financial disclosures. Mitt Romney appears to be the richest Republican, worth about $250 million. To which Rudolph Giuliani said, 'I would have been worth that much if I had just one wife, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain and Texas Senator John Cornyn recently got into a heated match, yelling at each other over the details of this new immigration bill, arguing about immigration. Ironically, you know how it ended? Mexican standoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today, 'We need to find a middle ground on immigration.' We already have a middle ground on immigration. It's called Texas, Arizona; Southern California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting, under this new immigration bill, illegal immigrants would be able to legally get jobs and become American citizens. Now, do you think that will work? I'm just curious. ... Follow me here. The argument has always been that illegal immigrants are willing to do the jobs Americans won't do. So if they become Americans, they're not going to want to do those jobs either, right? So we've got to bring in more illegals to take those jobs. It just goes on and on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Chicago couple is suing McDonald's after they found a bag of marijuana, a lighter and a pipe in their daughter's Happy Meal. Hey, you think they're upset? How about the guy who bought the bag of marijuana and found a hamburger and French fries, okay? How do you think he feels?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the 'Late Show,' or as Jimmy Carter calls it, the worst show in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview Jimmy Carter lashed out with unprecedented criticism of the current Administration's policies. But George W. Bush will not respond with his own criticism of the Carter Administration because he believes such attacks are inappropriate and also because he can't remember anything from the years 1977 to 1981.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A concert's being planned to celebrate Nelson Mandela's birthday. And friends say that Mandela wants the Spice Girls to perform. Yeah, apparently, 27 years in prison really screws with your taste in music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news about the '08 presidential election. Florida just announced it has moved up its primary to January 29th. That's right. Yeah, this will give Florida voters a chance to get to the polls earlier and cast their votes for Herbert Hoover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, came to America today to check into a weight loss clinic, because he's dangerously obese. Apparently, Talabani is the only Iraqi these days worried about dying of natural causes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C-SPAN is launching a new satellite radio station that will be completely dedicated to covering the 2008 presidential election. That's right. Experts say that listening to C-SPAN is the perfect solution for people who find watching C-SPAN too stimulating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Congress is considering issuing a no confidence resolution concerning Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. After hearing this, President Bush said, 'You know, that's not going to help his confidence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're little more than a year and a half away from the series finale of the Bush Administration. On Saturday, former President Jimmy Carter told an Arkansas newspaper that he thinks this Administration is the worst in history. Today, though he said the comments were misinterpreted. He said he wasn't making a direct attack on President Bush. It was just one of many things on his annual 'Worst' list. ... You can see, right here -- Worst Animal: Wombat; Worst Sequel: 'Grease 2'; Worst Chow Mein: Dynasty Restaurant, Tulsa, Oklahoma; Worst Country: Mozambique; Worst Cat: Mexican Hairless; Worst Kool Aid Flavor: Lime. ... Worst Sportscaster: Bryant Gumbel; Worst Place To Be Punched: The Neck; and Worst President: Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, President Bush unveiled his tough new immigration policy. He wants to deport Jimmy Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you know by now, over the weekend, Jimmy Carter called President Bush and his Administration the worst in history. Well, you know, President Bush's approval numbers have dropped as low as 28%. That's the lowest for any president since Jimmy Carter, so I guess...he knows what he's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a rough week for President Bush. He was caught driving by reporters not wearing his seat belt. He was down on the ranch; he was driving around without a seat belt on. His aide said he just refuses to buckle up. You know, Bill Clinton had the exact same problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I said, immigration is the big issue. And proponents say we need the immigrants from Mexico to take the jobs Americans don't want to do. Now don't confuse that with India, where the people are taking the jobs Americans want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See under this new congressional plan, illegal immigrants will be able to live in the United States if they pay a $5,000 fine -- $5,000. So that would rule out working people or parents trying to support a family however, you would get to keep all of the drug dealers, because they can come up with $5,000 just like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday Democrat Bill Richardson officially announced he's running for president. So now he officially has no chance of winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democrats announced they're going to have six debates in six different cities all around the country and the good news, Hillary Clinton will use a different accent for each city.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts say this is going to be a very busy hurricane season. To which FEMA said, 'Not for us!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iraq ? I'm not even going to try to say his name, because nobody knows what it is anyways. But he has come to America for treatment of his obesity. That's when you know you're fat, when you come to America for treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what this guy should do? ... He should just get out and walk around with all of the fat-ass Americans. He'd feel thin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new study by NASA, this is interesting, an afternoon nap can increase performance by as much as 50%.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama recently spent two days campaigning in New Hampshire. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, everywhere, everywhere...he went in New Hampshire, Obama was greeted with shouts of 'Go Barack,' 'Beat Hillary,' and 'Hey, look, it's a black guy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President of Iraq Jalal Talabani is apparently dangerously obese, so he came to the United States to check into a weight loss clinic. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at his ranch in Texas, President Bush hosted the leader of NATO. Yeah. Yeah, there was an awkward moment when Bush said, 'Maybe someday, I could visit you in Natonia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
