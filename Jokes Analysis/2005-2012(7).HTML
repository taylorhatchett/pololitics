<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration has reversed itself and is now considering moving the trial of the 9/11 terrorists out of Manhattan after protests from Congress and the mayor of New York. ... See, they're going to do an off-Broadway version first, see if people like it. See, then if it does well, then they'll bring it into the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, the terrorists ? the terrorists, they want it in Manhattan. A jury of their peers? Sure, a bunch of New York cab drivers. They'd get off like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released yet another audiotape message. Where does he find all these audiotapes, okay? You can't even buy audiotapes anymore. I mean, is there a tiny country in the Middle East called Radioshackastan? Is that where they're coming from? Where do you -- we can't even play them. We don't have machines that old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great Britain and America now have proposed a half a billion dollar fund to create jobs for Taliban members who agree to lay down their arms. And if it works there, they're going to offer the same deal to NBA players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Goldman Sachs' CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, is getting a $100 million bonus. Goldman Sachs denied it, saying, 'Well, no figure has been decided on yet.' You know what that means? He's getting more. Exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems John Edwards' mistress has gone to court to get a restraining order against the release of a sex tape she made with John Edwards. She says she's worried it will hurt her career. I thought her career was getting knocked up by presidential candidates. ... Well, apparently, I'm way out of line. But I don't care because this show has been canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am stunned that John Edwards made a sex tape. Do you realize this guy is basically Paris Hilton with better hair? That's all he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, Edwards has no remorse. Today, he called ABC to see if he could be the next 'Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state controller warned today that California could be broke by April. ... I think that's great news. I thought we were already broke, didn't you? We got two months worth of money left. Let's party!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In The $3.8 Trillion Federal Budget:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Three point five trillion dollars given to committee fighting overspending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. President now has to pay $25 for each bag he brings aboard Air Force One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Cut NASA budget so much, next mission is to New Haven, Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Estimate does not include convenience fee of $3.95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Government is raising the money by sending out a drunk Rip Torn to rob banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. United States pays for Ahmadinejad's tan windbreakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It allocates five billion dollars for a giant wallet to hold all money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Don't tell him, it's a surprise, but McCain's getting a new Craftmatic adjustable bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. One billion dollars research grant to figure out what the hell iPad does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The naked centerfold of senator-elect Scott Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama got out of jury duty. ... No word yet about getting us out of Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's big news: US Senate reconfirms chairman of the Fed. ... Ben Bernanke was reconfirmed. ... So he'll have the job for four more years. I just hope we have an economy for four more years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when they hung Saddam Hussein? ... Well, you remember his buddy, Chemical Ali. ... Well, he got hanged over the weekend. And his wife was...Chemical Shirley. Do you remember Chemical Shirley? I was just wondering is it too soon to hit on Chemical Shirley?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is the one that killed all the Kurds, Chemical Ali. He shouldn't be confused with the guy who killed NBC. That was Chemical Zucker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unfortunate. I heard that John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth have legally separated. ... Under the reasons for separation, Elizabeth Edwards just wrote 'see news.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's been talking about Barack Obama's first year in office. But did you also know this was George Bush's first year not in office? ... Bush has been doing a lot of speaking. ... He wowed 'em at the 'Get Motivated' seminar. Killed earlier this month at the Safari Club International Hunter's Convention. And -- this is the big one ? coming up, he's going to be the keynote speaker at the 2010 National Grocers Association Annual Conference of Supermarket Synergy Showcase! ... I wonder if he will stick around for the grocery bagging contest. ... Wait, that's real?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I won a Grammy! For the soundtrack to my special, 'A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All.' ... This is just a stepping stone to bigger things, folks. After all, Al Gore won a Grammy, and a Nobel Peace Prize. Barack Obama won a Grammy, and then a Nobel Peace Prize. So next year, that peace prize is mine. I don't care who I have to kill to get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Your Film Wasn't Nominated For An Academy Award: &quot;5. You bribed Academy president with a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Oscar nominations were announced today, you guys. Best Actor nominees included George Clooney for 'Up in the Air,' Jeremy Renner...for 'The Hurt Locker,' and President Obama for the 'State of the Union.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read in 'The New York Times' that the Obama Administration is planning huge changes to President Bush's 'No Child Left Behind' law. The new law will be called, 'Let's Face It, Some Kids Are Just Duds.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a Goodwill store that's having an anti-Valentine's Day donation drive where people can give away clothes that belonged to their exes. I swear. In fact, tonight, I'm wearing one of John Edwards' old suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, by the way, is...Groundhog Day. ... And this morning, the groundhog known to humans as Punxsutawney Phil was ripped from his hole by men dressed like the mayor in Monopoly. ... The animal rights group PETA has asked the organizers of this ridiculous event to replace Punxsutawney Phil with a robot groundhog. ... You create one robot groundhog, and before you know it, they take over the planet, you have to send people back in time to exterminate them, and then we have no governor anymore. It's not a good idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember 'Cash for Clunkers'? ... It was supposed to benefit the American automakers, but instead, everyone bought a Toyota. Well, guess what ? ... 'Toyota is recalling more than two millions vehicles to fix accelerator pedals with mechanical problems that can cause them to become stuck.' Boys, we're back in the game! All we had to do was have the leading competition become a death trap.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has announced his Administration's plan to build a new $8 billion dollar high-speed rail system. ... Have you ever ridden on Amtrak? We can't figure out how to keep a low-speed rail system from crashing, okay. Do you really want to go off the track at 150 miles an hour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC News reports that the president of Pakistan...slaughters a black goat every day since becoming president in an attempt to ward off the evil eye. It's good to see these modern, progressive people are our allies in the war against terror.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supposedly there is a John Edwards sex tape out there. Well, it's a tape of him and his mistress, Rielle Hunter, having sex. I don't know. Is that really news? A lawyer screwing somebody? Doesn't that happen every day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well now, Rielle Hunter has a restraining order against the former Edwards&quot; aide &quot;who has the tape. Hunter claims...he stole the tape out of her hatbox. Her hatbox? When did they make this tape, 1955?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the wife of South Carolina governor Mark Sanford&quot; has &quot;written a book...about her whole ordeal. Remember, he went to Argentina to see his mistress? She says her husband kept pestering her for permission to see his mistress. See, that shows you how bad the Republicans are at cheating, okay. They ask permission. Republicans, stick to what they know -- greed. Leave adultery to Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a historical fact. It was on this day in 1690, the first paper...money was printed up in the colony of Massachusetts. The pilgrims realized that when they ran out of money, they could just print more. Thus, the Federal government was born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now coming out with the new, 75th addition of Monopoly, this time with a round board. No more square boards. ... And actually, they've updated the whole game. In the new version, the banker is a Wall Street CEO. He overextends mortgages, he loses the bank, and when things go under, he uses his get out of jail for free card. So it's all very realistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's having a big Super Bowl party. This is very shrewd. He has invited a group of Republicans to come to the White House for his Super Bowl party. He's going to seat the 'you lie' guy next to the 'not true' guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is very shrewd about bringing the Republicans into the White House for the Super Bowl party because he feels like if he can get them to pass the dip, maybe they'll pass healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told Obama, he said, 'Listen, you get 10 Republicans to show up, and I'll drop in and choke on a pretzel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's something interesting and important. The Pentagon now wants to allow gays to serve openly in the military. You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen? More parades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was Bill Clinton who popularized the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. But...don't confuse that with another Clinton policy ? 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell Hillary.' That was a whole different policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a town hall meeting in New Hampshire yesterday, President Obama said that using stimulus money to help schools is not sexy, but it's making a difference. Oddly enough, that's the same way he describes Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the town hall event, President Obama also said jobs will be our number one focus in 2010. He then added, 'Specifically, mine and Biden's jobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama also had some economic advice for the American people. He told them not to blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college. Though to be fair, most recent college graduates would probably have more luck in Vegas, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is really trying to bring people together. He told Senate Democrats that politics can't be just about scoring points. Then today, he was sued by the Knicks for stealing their motto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's talking about the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. Admiral Mike Mullen said it's wrong to force people to lie about who they are in order to serve their country. Then Congress was like, 'Who cares? We do that every election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is getting more angry criticism today. Boy, this guy can't get a break. Apparently, though, he told a group of high school kids in...New Hampshire, and I quote, 'When times are tough, you tighten your belts. You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash in Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize.' And needless to say, people in Vegas are extremely upset. In fact, the mayor of Las Vegas said the President is not welcome in Las Vegas. ... I happen to agree with the mayor. How dare the President tell high school kids not to blow their college money in Las Vegas. We're in a recession right now. What about Siegfried? What about Roy? What about their tigers? The tigers cannot survive on eating magicians alone. ... They need money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' could be a thing of the past, very soon. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, says he believes gays should serve in the military, all gays, whether they want to or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In last week's State of the Union address, President Barack Obama renewed his vow to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', the policy that keeps openly gay Americans from serving in the military. So that's from the commander-in-chief. Well what about military brass ? Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen? Well yesterday, they went before the Senate Armed Services Committee and stood tall. 'Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself and myself only, it is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do. No matter how I look at this issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.' Permission to get goose bumps, sir!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, folks, but I've got bad news. We Americans once had the greatest military in the world! But yesterday, it was viciously de-greatified. In a Senate hearing on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' the chairman of the joint chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, said this. 'It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do.' Time to run up the white flag, folks. Oh, but make sure it's rainbow colored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next thing we know, they'll be giving out Purple Hearts for being fabulous under fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fortunately, a real military hero was there to reject the admiral's unwanted advances. 'I'm happy to say that we still have a Congress of the United States that...would have to pass a law to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', despite your efforts to repeal it, in many respects, by fiat.&quot; By Fiat?! With all due respect, Sen. McCain, it would most likely be by Subaru Outback.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, on this issue, McCain's got a life partner: Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who warned just what kind of deviant behavior gays in the military might lead to. 'Examples include alcohol use, adultery, fraternization, and body art.' He's right. What will happen if our brave sailors got tattoos, hung around with loose women, or drank alcohol?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know that America is hurting. ... Unemployment is over 10% and that doesn't even count everyone who's out of work. ... 'When you take into account what we call 'underemployment' ? that's Americans who are looking for full-time work but can't find it -- it comes up to about 17%.' And if you add people who have jobs but send spend most of the day on Facebook, it's up to the mid-90s.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota recalling 2.3 million cars because of two problems -- unintended acceleration and possible brake problems. Things are not looking good for Toyota. In fact, today, two...crash test dummies refused to get in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just two weeks before he is scheduled to go to Nevada to campaign for Harry Reid, President Obama said Las Vegas is a place of excess that people should not visit during hard times. I guess the President feels if you want to see people cavorting with prostitutes and wasting your money, go to Washington.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something pretty unbelievable. The only living World War I veteran, a man named Frank Buckles, just turned 109 years old. What's even more amazing, he just finished his fourth tour in Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a number of high-ranking officials in the military have come forward to say they feel gays should be allowed to serve in the armed forces. ... I think gay people should be allowed to serve. I mean, think about it. ... What are we defending here in America? Lady Gaga, 'Dancing with the Stars,' 'American Idol,' the TV show 'Glee.' Hello, look around, people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wife of Governor Mark Sanford -- you know the guy who snuck off to Argentina to see his mistress? You know this moron, this idiot?

You want to get your heart racing, you really want to get it pump pumping? ... Do what I do. Drive to work in a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this big Toyota recall? And things are dangerous, and I'm coming to work in my car. Here's how scary it is. The navigation lady was actually praying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the Super Bowl coming up Sunday? And the New Orleans Saints fans, I'm telling you, they have waited a long, long time for their team to get into the Super Bowl. ... Not as long as they waited for FEMA, but still, it's been a very long, long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is having a big Super Bowl party. And you know what he is doing? This guy is shrewd, very savvy politically.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new Osama bin laden video. Gosh, I mean, this guy, what is he doing, working at Blockbuster?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is always a new Osama bin Laden video. And in this one, he's worried about global warming. ... And he's blaming the United States for global warming.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, president Obama spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. Obama told the crowd that no one should go broke when they get sick in the richest nation on earth, which, I think, is his way of saying we're going to start exporting sick people to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. On the 'Today' show, this morning, Michelle Obama said she likes having her mother live at the White House because she helps take care of Sasha and Malia. And Barack Obama said he likes having his mother-in-law living at the White House because he has to say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about what's going on with Toyota? This is crazy. It's like, their job is to make cars, right? ... Well, they had a problem with gas pedals getting stuck -- now, they're recalling the Prius because the brakes don't work. And because of this, sales of Ford cars and trucks rose 25% in the past month. But Ford says it's because of their new ad slogan, 'Ford, because Toyota is trying to kill you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in California is working on a new wireless monitor for pill bottles that tattles on you when you forget to take your medicine.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study found that eating corned beef for breakfast could help you lose weight. Doesn't sound like a study. That sounds like something a guy who eats corned beef for breakfast says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new research found that one in five people has an 'unfitness' gene, which makes them out of shape no matter how much they exercise. The same research also found that five out of five people will now use that as their excuse for being out of shape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke about our state's infrastructure yesterday. Or tried to. His English still isn't very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has decided to skip the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. I think he's still mad they stiffed him in Chicago. But, they said it would be very expensive to arrange proper security for Obama, so they're sending Vice President Joe Biden in his place. Because, you know, who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President won't be at the Super Bowl either. In fact, in a show of some sort of spirit of cooperation, I guess, he's invited a group of top Republicans to watch the game with him at the White House on Sunday. ... That should be a lot of fun. Going to need a two-thirds vote before they pass him the Doritos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, last November, the Administration announced their plan to hold a public, civilian trial in New York City for terrorist mastermind and human shag carpet, Khalid Sheik Mohammed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for Toyota. According to CNN, Toyota has known about this brake problem in its Prius cars for some time, but didn't mention it to people who bought them. What?! Car salesmen lying? I am stunned!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know anything about the new senator from the great state of Massachusetts? ... Senator Scott Brown. Comes out of nowhere, this guy. And he used to be, like, a go-go boy. That's where he got his start. And then he was a nude model, and now, he's a senator. Have you...seen the guy? Terribly good-looking. He looks like one of those guys in an adult film who would describe his work as 'tasteful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like one of those guys at the health club that would snap you with his towel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we've got another one of those...videotapes from Osama bin Laden. I mean, they're coming like once a month now. It's like you're in a club. You sign up, you get the whole collection. Time-Life: Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in this one, he's blaming the United States for global warming. ... Says the United States caused global warming, and by gosh, they better stop global warming. Sounds to me like somebody's looking for a Nobel Prize, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very ecologically minded. Like, last year, it was documented by the CIA that Osama bin Laden switched to a hybrid camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was busy holding two fundraisers in DC last night. During one of his speeches, Obama told the crowd, 'We can't be afraid of the future.' ... Most Americans agree with him, mainly because they are so busy being afraid of the present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said, 'We can't be afraid of the future.' And Biden was like, 'What about clowns? Can we be afraid of clowns?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also said that the key to competing with China is to improve our math and science education. Because right now our GDP is about $13 trillion and China's is $3 trillion, which means we're still ahead by, uh -- trillions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tough out there. Even the Obama store in Washington, DC, is closing. That's where they sell t-shirts, hats, and calendars with Obama's face on them. You can tell they're Obama calendars. They only go up to 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on '20/20,' Barbara Walters sat down with the first lady of South Carolina, Jenny Sanford. Jenny Sanford is the estranged wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who, as you may recall, went AWOL to visit a mistress in Argentina last summer. His wife has a new book out. ... In the book, she says that when they got married, she agreed to let him remove the promise to be faithful from the wedding vows. See, now, that -- that should have been a clue right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also says the Governor was a bit of a cheapskate and for her birthday, he gave her a drawing of...half a bicycle. And then for Christmas, she got a drawing of the other half and a $25 used bike. And then another birthday, he bought her a diamond necklace and then boxed it back up and returned it to the store. Fiscally responsible, you have to admit that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first ever Tea Party Convention is going on right now in Nashville. The tea partiers are a group of Americans who think the government is too big and also like to party and have tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And their featured speaker is Sarah Palin. ... They say she's getting $100,000 to be there: 98 grand for wardrobe, 2,000 to speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China and the United States have been locked into a series of trade disputes. President Obama said this week that China is putting US exports at a disadvantage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans attended President Obama's Super Bowl party. ... And I thought oh, yeah, they care about New Orleans, now!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody snowed in the big blizzard? Like, over two feet, down there in Washington, DC. ... DC completely ground to a halt. ... Absolutely nothing going on. Well, how you can tell the difference?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold in Washington...that the new senator from Massachusetts, Scott Brown, was actually wearing pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I am talking about? The new senator from the state of Massachusetts. ... Before he got into politics, he had two jobs. He was a go-go boy. And he was also a nude model. And they swore him in last week. It was a moving ceremony. He put his hand on a copy of 'Cosmo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Sarah Palin was speaking to a group called the Tea Party Group. ... And she received a hundred thousand dollars in payment. ... Now, of course, she was paid in pelts, but still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to go...to this Tea Party deal, it was a 350 bucks a plate. ... And if you wanted a glass or a cup, well, that was more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But 350 bucks a plate and a lot of people say, 'Whoa! Dave, that seems a little pricey.' Yes, but for 350, a guy will come to your table and waterboard a lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, Sarah Palin looked at notes written on her hand during a speech at the Tea Party Convention in Tennessee. Isn't that wild? Oddly enough, she was reading, 'Hi, I'm Sarah Palin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Super Bowl was not the only gathering of great Americans this weekend. The National Tea Party held their first convention in Nashville, Tennessee. ... The keynote address delivered by Fox News' own Sarah Palin,&quot; who &quot;believes Obama's hope and change...rhetoric is no match for her maverick-y, note card, hand-scribbled buzz words. ... You really need to remind yourself to 'Lift American Spirits?' Unless 'Lift American Spirits' is a note to steal a carton of cigarettes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Toyotas aren't the only thing crashing and burning right now. So is the Obama Presidency. ... The latest scandal is that Obama's FBI interrogated the underwear bomber...for only 50 -- five-zero -- minutes before reading him his Miranda rights. Even worse, they didn't phrase any of their questions in the form of a taser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was...a big weekend for Sarah Palin. She was in Nashville, giving a rousing speech&quot; to the &quot;National Tea Party Convention. ... 'This is about the people. And it's bigger than any king or queen of a tea party. And it's a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter.' ... Of course, folks, the blogo-chato-sphere has been giving Palin heat for zinging Obama over his teleprompter, just because she herself used a hand-o-prompter. ... Oh big deal! Writing notes on your hand shows she's an average Jane. Not like those elites and their memory!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New Orleans Saints are the Super Bowl champs. ... The Indianapolis Colts, they're a great team, too, but...they didn't win. Did you see them? I mean, they thought they couldn't lose. You see them, all arrogant. ... Peyton Manning had that look on his face that Hillary Clinton had, like 'I'm supposed to win. ... How can I not win?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you Sarah Palin at the Tea Party Convention on Saturday? Well, this is ? I'm starting to love her, really. She...mocked President Obama for using a teleprompter and then, someone noticed...she had notes written on her hand. And she had the words 'energy', 'budget', with the word 'cuts' crossed off, 'tax', and 'lift American spirits' written on her palm.... It lifted my spirits, so -- mission accomplished, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Writing stuff on your hand ? it's not a good idea. It's actually why President Bush...invaded Iraq instead of Iran. He wrote it down, I guess he played, like, nine holes of golf, and...now here we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe&quot; Sarah Palin would be &quot;smarter if she had bigger hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Sarah Palin is no dummy. This is actually a calculated move designed to promote her new book, 'Cheat Sheets and Moose Meats.' It's a collection of recipes that that you can write in moose blood right on your hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's also getting criticized&quot; because &quot;last week she demanded that Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, step down because he used the word retarded. But then, Rush Limbaugh did the same thing on his radio show and that, she said, was okay. Unfortunately, she's been unable to respond to the criticism because she's wearing mittens. ... Cold all over the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The East Coast is covered in snow right now. ... Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia got almost 35 inches over the weekend. And may get 20 more inches tomorrow. ... Schools and businesses were closed. They're building snow-bamas all over the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal government was shut down today, and...they estimate it cost about $100 million in lost productivity. The House is literally stuck in the House, and they can't do anything. ... I have to admit, it is nice to see lawmakers shoveling something else for a change, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most congressmen are actually...taking this opportunity with all the snow to spend some quality time with their mistresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, as you know it is Black History Month. .. Well, today I saw a bus ad&quot; that &quot;perfectly expresses how to best rejoice in the achievements of our black countrymen. 'Come and celebrate Black History Month with Heineken.' First off, I should probably explain to black people what Heineken is. It's a delicious European lager first brewed in Holland in 1864 and it is the drink of choice for white people when they're discussing whether they should have invited some black people to their party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a Dutch beer is a natural compliment to celebrating African-American achievement. After all, if it weren't for the help of the Dutch merchants, there wouldn't even be African-Americans. They'd still just be Africans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're also celebrating another long-oppressed minority, corporations. The Supreme Court recently ruled that corporations have the right to make unlimited contributions to political ad campaigns. ... Now, I have always fought for freedom of corporate speech. That's why mine was the first presidential campaign to be sponsored by a snack chip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, last September, I predicted the country was headed for a glorious future. 'We can't stop with just freedom of speech. We must endow corporations with all the freedoms we flesh and blood people have been hogging for too long.... And if corporations are people, why can't we just cut out the middle man and elect President Microsoft Office Assistant Clippy?' He does have some great ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, Bob Dylan performed at the White House&quot; in &quot;honor of Black History Month. Because when you think of black history, you think of a mumbling, white, Jewish guy from Minnesota.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We learned last weekend&quot; that &quot;Sarah Palin...writes notes on her hand when she's giving speeches. ... You can see the notes right there on her hand. The first one is, 'Hitch up the dogsled,' 'buy Chapstick,' 'clean rifle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure what this says about us, but two new polls just came out.

And then another poll, by the same company at the same time, found that only 59% of Americans support homosexuals serving openly in the military. I guess it means that 11% of Americans don't know homosexuals are gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who loves the Winter Olympics? You wouldn't guess this. Former Vice President Dick Cheney. He loves it. He thinks that snowboarding is waterboarding but colder.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something that was sort of interesting. You know who Robert Gibbs is? He's the Barack Obama White House...press secretary. ... So he runs all of the press...conferences that they have there. And, apparently, he is now...down to 89 laughs per month. Getting only 89 laughs per month. And so, he's going to go back to 'Headlines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know...those press briefings,&quot; the &quot;ones they had toward the end of George Bush's term? Those were hilarious. ... 'Mission accomplished'. Remember how funny that was? ... 'The economy's fine.' Oh, that's hilarious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's having a feud? Dick Cheney and Joe Biden. ... It's because Joe Biden removed Dick Cheney's dungeon at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm kind of embarrassed to say, I actually, and I'm not kidding, I wish I was, set my alarm last night to make sure I was up in time for Tiger Woods' apology. ... It was covered on pretty much every channel except the Food Network, I think. And the excitement surrounding this historic event could hardly be contained. 'Less than three hours before Tiger Woods speaks.' ... 'He's going to speak in exactly a minute and a half.' 'Tiger Woods set to walk out now in about 40 seconds.' I guess this is like the closest thing we get to the thrill of a space launch now that we can't afford NASA anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC News has learned that the Obama Administration has decided to given the war in Iraq, which is currently known as 'Operation Iraqi Freedom', a new name. Starting September 1st -- this is true -- the war will be known as 'Operation New Dawn'. ... It's twice the grease-fighting power of the original 'Dawn'. It will make your war spotless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know why it is a good day today? I'll tell you why. Because the new credit card regulations start today. That's good news if you have credit card debt, like me. I racked up 50 grand on bedazzlers.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But starting today,&quot; the &quot;credit card companies have to scale back their evil ways. They can't raise or increase rates whenever they want. That's great news, because Americans owe $874 billion to credit card companies. To be fair, most of that is Mel Gibson's bar tab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't keep many credit cards because I'm worried someone might steal my identity. Yeah, right. Like anyone would want my identity. After two days, they'd beg me to take it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Credit card companies make most of their profits from loaning money to people who they know can't pay it back. That's why credit card companies are evil. ... They're like a cross between Satan and divorce lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Credit card companies have been good for one group, of course. The mafia. When you need to borrow money, the mob seems like a better deal. 'You don't pay me back, I break both your legs.' 'Is that all? Fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're like me, you were glued to your TV the last few days, watching the inspiring displays of the American spirit, the drama, the celebration, showing the true glory and power of what America can accomplish. 'Welcome to the conservative comeback and the beginning of the end of the Pelosi Congress: CPAC 2010.' Yeah! ... Real America held their yearly Olympics, the Conservative Political Action Conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this year's 'Festival of Whites' brought a record-breaking 10,000 people to DC.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to say, it was actually refreshing to see a car company CEO appear before Congress and not ask for $10 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney was rushed to the hospital in Washington, DC, yesterday with chest pains. Doctors say he -- oh. Let's just move on. We're not going to top that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to the Credit Card Accountability and Responsibility Disclosure Act,&quot; banks &quot;'generally can no longer raise interest rates on your existing balance.' 'They must give you 45 days notice before raising the interest rate on anything you buy going forward.' 'By law, your bank must now spell out how long it'll take you to pay off your card.' See! All we needed was the information. Like when they put up the calorie charts at McDonald's and you knew exactly how many calories were in the Big Mac and large fries that you continue to eat no matter what.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that's it! From now on, it's going to be on the up and up! That is, wait, unless...the banks are run by sentient beings who saw this coming. 'Congress gave the banks nine months to comply with these rules and they used that time to raise interest rates almost across the board. ... And look for all kinds of new fees as banks try to make up for billions in lost income, even fees if you don't use your card enough.' Hey, what the, hey, wha?! A fee for not using your credit card? Let me see if I can reenact the meeting where they came up with that. 'Uh, well it's not like we can charge people for not buying things. What?! Why is everyone kissing me?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for...former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was released from the hospital today. He's doing well. Doctors say he'll be up and shooting lawyers in no time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Congress held more hearings with the executives of Toyota. ... Akio Toyoda, the president of the...company and great-grandson of the company founder, came in from Japan to testify. This is a big deal, because this guy...is a notoriously private person. ... He rarely checks his Facebook account. He's very private.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He came to apologize, and I think he even offered to kill himself with a sword.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Dick Cheney was released from the hospital today after being treated for a mild heart attack, his fifth heart attack. Next one's free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something weird happened in the hospital. When they were putting the electrodes on him for the EKG, he suddenly started screaming, &quot;Stop! I'll tell you everything you want to know!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors have sent him home with strict instructions not to watch 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, for the last year, the President has been engaged in an ambitious overhaul of our healthcare system, in order to make good on his campaign promise to kill the elderly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just kill them already. Enough bipartisanship. We're running out of time. They're going to gum us to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's not the only healthcare promise Obama hasn't kept. 'His campaign promise on healthcare reform, which I believed, was that we would sit down and negotiate together, Republicans and Democrats. We didn't. He said he'd have the C-SPAN cameras in the room.' ... Poor John McCain. Obama lied to him. 'He said he had my nose between his fingers. It turns out it, was just his thumb. I...went around for three weeks, thinking I had no nose.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well guess what? Tomorrow, Barack Obama's getting Democrats and Republicans together, at the Blair House, to discuss healthcare live on C-SPAN. It's everything they always wanted. 'This summit on the 25th is nothing but political showmanship.' 'It is a media event that's being created by the White House.' 'It's a travesty.' 'The Democrats spell summit s-e-t-u-p.' What?! Wow! Democrats are stupid. Because, that's -- what do they do when they want to spell the word setup?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, to allay Republican fears that this 'summit' was a 's-e-t-u-p', the White House released details on February 12th, specifying who would be invited to the summit and what the format of the summit would be. And, after having 10 days to peruse that document, on February 22nd, Cynthia Lummis, Republican Wyoming, took to the floor of the House. 'Do we even know who's going to be in attendance at the summit? Do we know the format of that summit?' Wow! Either that lady doesn't have an Internet connection or staffers or -- she never learned how to read!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As difficult and contentious as this healthcare debate has been,&quot; there &quot;has been one big upshot. And that is, our Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, got to go on 'The Early Show' this morning to say this. 'Remember, with healthcare reform, Teddy Roosevelt talked about healthcare reform in 1912.' ... That's the word twelve and wolf combined. He's been going to his numbers class, but they're only up to eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on 'American idol,' four karaoke singers, two men and two women, were sent home, assuming their homes weren't foreclosed on while they were gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

But not quite as excited as I am about the most powerful man in the world saying my name in space.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems with the auto industry. General motors announced a recall of 1.3 million cars because of a steering problem. Apparently, the cars are unable to steer out of the path of oncoming Toyotas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is on the program tonight? Mitt Romney is here. ... When he gets out here, if he looks familiar, you may have seen him on 'The Young and the Restless.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He plays Tyler Cavanaugh IV. True story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney is a good-looking Republican from Massachusetts. You know, he's like that new senator from Massachusetts. He's like Scott Brown, but with pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama yesterday had his annual physical. Annual check-up. Apparently everything is all right. Earlier today, former Vice President Dick Cheney went in for his annual autopsy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's physical turned out great. The doctor said a couple of things. ... He said, 'Cut out the cigarettes. Also, try to stay out of Toyotas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talking about presidents who smoked. You remember George W. Bush? Remember him? He's saying while he was president he would enjoy the occasional cigar. On a rare occasion, he would have a cigar because he said it helped him think. I want to tell you, occasions don't get more rare than that, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys watch the season finale of 'The Bachelor' last night? Well, fans are not happy that Jake proposed to Vienna instead of Tenley. Yeah, people are very angry that he picked a lady that nobody really likes. And then John McCain was like, 'Hey, it happens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House announced a contest for high schools to have President Obama speak at their graduation. It's really exciting because so far, Obama has only given speeches at 70% of the nation's high schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys been following this recall stuff? It's getting totally out of hand. Now the Obama Administration might require all cars to have an override system in case the brake pedal doesn't work. Personally, I like the old override system, a tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'People' magazine has confirmed that former President Clinton called Tiger Woods to offer his support during the ordeal. For real. They have things in common, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a nice thing to do, a nice gesture between two, you know, kindred spirits. It actually reminds me of the time President Bush called Homer Simpson after Homer stapled his face to a doughnut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know which conversation I would rather hear, Bill and Tiger or Elin and Hillary on the phone together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I do hope you at home are sitting down, or if you're standing, at least have a bite stick in your teeth, because, the White House has dropped a bombshell. ... It is the result of President Obama's first physical since taking office. In it, the President's physician...recommends 'moderation in alcohol intake.' ... Folks, I tell you, we've ignored the warning signs. Beer summit? Hello! Clearly, he insulted that cop just for the excuse to pound a sixer of Old Milwaukee tall-boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you ever notice how no one ever lets him drive? So sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President's clear, crippling alcoholism is just the tip of the bourbon-soaked ice cube here. Despite Obama's apparent health, the doctor also recommends he have a 'healthy diet' and 'up-to-date immunizations.' That means Obama is obese and has rabies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, his days are numbered. Okay? Get used to hearing the words 'President Biden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were going to recommend a doctor, this is what I would do. I would recommend whatever doctor is working on Dick Cheney because he's like Jason from 'Friday the 13th.' He won't die. ... Five heart attacks and he still walks among us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this story today? This is pretty wild. The FAA investigating why a child was allowed to direct air traffic at John F. Kennedy airport. You know this story? It appears an air traffic controller allowed one his the young kids to direct air traffic. Authorities say they got suspicious when five of the planes landed at a Toys 'R' Us parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that, children directing air traffic. Today the Chinese said, 'Why didn't we think of that? Sure, get more kids working.' Why not?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the pilots were stunned [at hearing a child direct air traffic]. One of them said, 'Am I still drunk or is that a kid's voice?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay marriage now legal in Washington, DC. How about that? So, if you're a congressman, in bed with a lobbyist, if you like it, you better put a ring on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in his new book, Karl Rove said that the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq badly damaged the Bush administration's credibility. It's all in his new book here, it's called 'Duh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representative Charles Rangel, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has temporarily surrendered his post pending an ethics investigation. They've been investigating him for three months now. And so far, they have not found a single trace of ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Yorkers are desperate. They're trying to get Paterson to leave early and I said to myself, 'that sounds like a job for Jay Leno.' .. But I don't know how serious this is. I won't believe that there's real trouble with the governor until I hear that he's told his staff he's hiking on the Appalachian Trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Gov. David Paterson &quot;said he will not run for election but he will serve his full term. He's going to finish his term. He's going to keep being governor till the very end. Did you hear that, Sara? 'Till the end. He's going to continue to be the governor till the very end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a great day for that air traffic accident controller at JFK. Did you hear about this? He let his young son talk to planes on the radio. Authorities say this is the worst abuse of 'bring your kid to work day' since Woody Allen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear that rush Limbaugh's Manhattan penthouse is on the market for $14 million. It's an amazing property. Over 4,000 square feet. And that's just the medicine cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's more crazy news coming out of the auto industry. Today, Nissan recalled over half a million cars with faulty brakes and fuel gauges. Toyota was like, 'just half a million? Oh, that's cute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove's new memoir, 'Courage and Consequence,' is coming out next week. Not sure if 'Courage and Consequence' is how most people would describe the Bush years but, I guess, it does sound better than 'Oopsies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Britain have developed a new camera that can identify a terrorist by the shape of their nose. Yeah, it's all part of the new technology called 'racism.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report found that a line of cocaine is now cheaper than a cup of coffee. Although, if you're choosing to snort coke instead of drinking coffee in the morning, it was never really about the money, was it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the last week, on principle, Republican Senator Jim Bunning singlehandedly held up emergency funding of unemployment benefits for millions of people on principle. ... I thought he stood for something, but last night, he caved in to bipartisan pressure which broke the stalemate and my heart. ... I'm sure it was hard to be universally reviled as a half-witted, egomaniacal sociopath, but doing the right thing is never easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Goldman Sachs has been making a killing off Greece by selling credit default swaps which are essentially bets that Greece will go bust. I hear Goldman has inside information that Greece is hiding its debt. This is what CEO Lloyd Blankfein meant when he said Goldman Sachs was, quote, 'doing God's work.' Specifically the God Hades by dragging the European economy to hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for the auto industry. General Motors announced this week they're recalling 1.3 million compact cars here in North America to address a power steering problem. Apparently, since President Obama took over the company, all the cars are veering to the left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Texas voters overwhelmingly nominated former Houston Mayor Bill White over Pakistani-born businessman Farouk Shami. Who could have seen that coming? Imagine Texans choosing a white guy named white over a Pakistani born businessman named Farouk Shami. It's like the world is upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had his annual physical last week. And while his colonoscopy revealed no polyps, they did find three MSNBC reporters and a 'New York Times' columnist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the government officially clarified exactly what the word organic means. It now means three times more expensive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former governor George W. Bush is writing a book, writing a book. How about that, about his eight years in the White House. It's all part of his war on literacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president George W. Bush is &quot;busy hard at work writing his memoirs down there at his home in Texas, Rancho Inepto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a memoir by George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends have been said [to former president George W. Bush] 'Jeez, congratulations, Mr. President, we didn't know you had a book deal, we didn't know you were going to write a book. We didn't know you were writing your memoirs or any of this.' And they said 'Are you using a ghostwriter?' And the former president said 'No, the guy's still alive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has teamed up with the guy who created 'The Apprentice' and they're going around trying to sell a reality show. And the first show, they've got the thing. They did a pilot already, and the first show, I don't know how you feel about this, she goes crazy and shoots and stuffs that thing on Donald trump's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I heard this, Sarah Palin, somebody said Sarah Palin is getting a reality show. I said 'Reality show, jeez, what about a reality check?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More crazy news from the car industry. An executive at GM is blaming his company's 1.3 million car recall on a parts supplier owned by Toyota. I'm just waiting for people to start blaming everything on Toyota. It's like the unemployment rate, the Kennedy assassination, global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a big story out of Washington. The Senate voted against a plan to send a $250 check to 57 million elderly people. In the end, senators decided not give the elderly money, because you know, they're just going to spend it on drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is pretty wild, Sarah Palin has been shopping around her own reality show. Yeah. of Course, any reality show about Sarah Palin will have to compete with that other reality show about Sarah Palin: the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a story today in the entertainment trade papers that Sarah Palin is shopping a reality show with the producer of 'Survivor', Mark Burnett. That's why she quit being the governor of Alaska. I find it strange that Sarah Palin would be shopping a reality show considering the fact that she hasn't shown much interest in reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama talked to Congress about healthcare. He said, 'Just get it done.' See, that's when you know things are bad, okay? When the President of the United States is quoting Larry the Cable Guy. 'Git er done!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush...announced today he is writing a book on how he made decisions while in the White House. The book will be divided into the two chapters, 'Heads' and 'Tails.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, this year, they expanded the Best Picture category to include 10 films. In fact, even the death montage -- they expanded that to include President Obama's healthcare plan. Did you notice that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about this? President Obama had a meeting at the White House with Jay-Z and Beyonce. And, in fact, they hit it off so well, Jay-Z gave the President his own rap name, 'Biggie Deficit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. Just four days after being arrested for driving drunk while leaving a gay bar with a man, California state Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview in 'Time' magazine, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer -- I love this -- he said that having sex with hookers...is not nearly as bad as having an affair. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone watch the Oscars last night? ... Big night for 'The Hurt Locker', which of course is a film about the war in Iraq, which, I guess explains why Obama called the director and was like, 'How did you end it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's been really busy, you guys. He's making his final push on healthcare reform.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama hosted the Alabama Crimson Tide football team at the White House. At one point, the quarterback threw a football to Obama, which was the first time during his Presidency that anything's gotten passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in San Diego, a man called the police when the accelerator on his Prius got stuck and made his car go 90 miles an hour. Luckily, the man was able to stop his car when he ran into another Toyota going in the opposite direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, an historic day in Washington, DC, today. The first ever legal same sex marriages took place. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, everyone's still talking about healthcare. Yesterday, the White House said that it wants to pass the healthcare bill by March 18th, or March 19th. But at the very, very latest, March 21st. Unless they have to wait until March 23rd, in which case they'll definitely want to pass it by April 6th. Or April 8th. Definitely by April 10th. The 6th through the 10th, or possibly April 12th is a possibility. April 12th, 2025 will definitely be the date. If not then, 2027. And if that doesn't come to fruition then, it's going to cut it off at 2040. So there you go. So, we'll have the healthcare bill by 2040, hopefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you heard the First Lady talk about this. Childhood obesity at an all-time high here in America. Give you an idea how bad it is, when children are filling out a form now, next to hometown, 83% of the kids write 'buffet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor is Tiger Woods is getting ready to return to golf. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'What would Eliot Spitzer do?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This: 'Now they're saying I groped a male staffer. Yeah, I did. Not only did I grope him, I tickled him 'til he couldn't breathe and four guys jumped on top of me.' See what I'm saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Mind if I do a little polling?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a lousy audience last night. ... You couldn't tell if they were laughing at the jokes or if they were being tickled by New York Congressman Massa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massa... goes on the Glenn Beck show and he says that he was having a birthday party tickling his staff. ... And he said one guy couldn't breathe, he was tickling him so hard. And then Dick Cheney said, 'Well, we should have done that at Gitmo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now this Congressman Eric Massa...is claiming that he was bullied in a gym by Rahm Emmanuel. The President's guy is bullying him in a gym, naked. And I know you are thinking to yourselves, 'Well gee, thanks a lot, Dave, for searing that image into our brains because that's something we'll carry for a long time right there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He admits to groping, fondling, and tickling. And I'm thinking, well, why isn't this guy governor of New York?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbie's birthday. Did you know that? ... And if you don't know Barbie...let me just tell you. She is the pretty, plastic doll who didn't run with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bush, George W. Bush, is now writing a book... about his eight years in the White House. And it's green. ... It's entirely made out of old Al Gore ballots. So that will be a keepsake for you there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton were at an event and Michelle said that she almost referred to Hillary as 'President Clinton' by mistake. And then Hillary was like, 'Ha-ha-ha. Seriously, though, would you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Massa just keeps getting into more and more trouble. ... One of Massa's former shipmates in the Navy says that he used to give his subordinates massages.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Eric Massa was living in a house in DC with a bunch of young single male staffers. Massa described the house as 'just a bunch of guys doing guy stuff', while the male staffers described it as a 'den of awkwardness.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove's memoir, 'Courage and Consequence', is the best-selling book on Amazon.com. The book costs $19.99, and comes with free shipping and mishandling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tiger Woods is reportedly ready to return to golf, possibly in two weeks in Orlando. ... According to 'The New York Post', Tiger's hired former President Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer to help with his PR campaign. ... Is that the guy you want in charge of your approval rating?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our president, Barack Obama, has been working on reforming our healthcare system for the better part of the past 300 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been some ups -- the passing of the House version of the bill, the passing of the Senate version of the bill. There have been some downs, mainly downs. There have been a lot of downs. ... You know, even the House and Senate bills were downs, actually. This has really been like the Quaalude of bills. It's been a lot of downs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now we enter Healthcare Reform 2.0: The Final Confrontation. 'President Obama back in campaign mode.' 'The last big push to try to pass healthcare reform.' 'All the marbles. All he can muster. One last shot. One final pitch. This is it.' That's the most ridiculous news intro I've ever seen in my...life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're acting like it's the Civil War and he's firing on Fort Sumter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may know, earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Israel to reignite peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians raising the question: Who will subvert the peace process this time? ... Of course, the...smart money's on Biden. The Administration sends Gaffemaster Flash to Israel. Seems like a risky play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, you know I love Karl Rove. I cannot get enough of this guy. Sometimes when I can't find him on TV, I'll just put a pair of wire-rimmed glasses on a loaf of ham, and...I'll pretend we're friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl's fun. That's why I am so pumped that on Tuesday, Karl Rove dropped his new book, 'Courage and Consequence.' It's just like 'Pride &amp; Prejudice,' but even more prejudiced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I am loving...the juicy details in this little book, okay? ... Like Karl's shocking revelation that he had nothing to do with the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Oh, and the bombshell that it wasn't him who spread the rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black baby. ... And, folks, you'll never guess who was really not behind the swift boat rumors about John Kerry. ... I am telling you, folks, this is a gripping 'who-didn't-dun-it?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, spoiler alert: Bush was a great president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, all this week I have been covering the Democrats' healthcare jihad. Now I know reconciliation is a confusing issue, and I know when you're confused, you're angry. And I certainly hope I've added to your confusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming on the Ides of March. You know, this is March 15th. It was on this day in 44 BC, Julius Caesar met his end. ... He was stabbed in the back by members of the Senate, ironically, while pleading for healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama, turning up the pressure on Congress to pass this healthcare reform. In fact, he's telling Democrats, if they don't vote for this bill, he will go out and campaign for them in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the 'Journal of Neurology' reports that the longer you smoke, the less likely you are to develop Parkinson's disease. ... So what are they telling us? Follow me guys. Remember, a couple of months ago, doctors said drinking a glass of alcohol every day...was good for your heart. Smoking prevents Parkinson's disease. Marijuana is good for glaucoma. Sex is good for your prostate. You know, screw healthcare. Let's party!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his speech to the Export/Import Bank's annual gathering, President Obama announced that he will establish two brain trusts to double US exports over the next five years. You know what our leading export is right now? ... Jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, learning more and more about that homegrown terrorist, that woman, Colleen LaRose, also known as Jihad Jane. They're calling her the most dangerous person to come out of Pennsylvania since Ben Roethlisberger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in World News, the tension between the White House and Israel at its highest level in 30 years. Israel wants to build more houses in its territory and the Obama Administration wants them torn down. Here's the solution: You build the houses but let Countrywide give everybody an adjustable rate mortgage. They'll be foreclosed on and out of there by July.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as part of an art project, 31 life-sized nude male statues will be set up all around Manhattan. They're so lifelike, former Congressman Eric Massa tried to tickle three of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Toyota's defense, there are allegations that the driver of that runaway Prius in San Diego may have faked it. ... The guy claims he couldn't stop a runaway Prius? Come on. Tiger Woods' wife stopped a runaway Cadillac Escalade with a nine-iron, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody changed their clocks this weekend for...daylight savings. So you move it ahead. And even the Taliban move their clocks ahead. They moved it up to the 11th century. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well here's something interesting. And I guess this goes with the job. President Obama announced over the weekend that he get 20,000 letters a day...calling him an idiot. And I said, 'Hey, welcome to the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to myself, 'Well hey, maybe I am presidential material.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in all fairness, a lot of those letters come from Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his weekly radio and Internet address, President Obama called for an overhaul of the 'No Child Left Behind' law. It will now be called 'The World Needs Janitors, Too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama talked about healthcare reform at a senior center in Strongsville, Ohio, today. The most common question he got: 'When's bingo?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw this yesterday on 'Meet the Press.' Tom Brokaw referred to...healthcare reform as a 'kerfuffle.' You thought passing healthcare was hard; ten times harder for Brokaw to pronounce 'kerfuffle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, folks. ... If I have a little less zazz than usual, you can thank the merchants of chaos responsible for daylight savings time. ... Now if I...end up getting in a fight with the tick-tock men, you know who I want on my side? Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy. Last Wednesday, he lit up Capitol Hill. ... 'We're talking about Eric Massa 24-7 on the TV. We're talking about war and peace, $3 billion, a thousand lives, and no press?! No press! The press of the United States is not covering the most significant issue of national importance and that's the laying of lives down in the nation for the service of our country. There's one, two press people in this gallery!' That tirade was way outta line. Those two members of the press were trying to sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the specific legislation being ignored...by the press was Dennis Kucinich's resolution to pull troops out of Afghanistan within 30 days. Now, while that May seem like an implausible fantasy, remember, the press did report on Kucinich's presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota is starting to fight back. Today, they cast doubt on the story of that guy -- remember the guy last week that said his Prius accelerated out of control on the freeway? They said they found significant inconsistencies in his story. And let me tell you something, that's embarrassing when a car dealer calls you a liar.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you're on the freeway, you know how to tell if a Prius next to you is out of control? Here's how you tell. If you look over and the driver's face goes from that smug, 'I'm saving the environment' look, to the frightened, 'get me the hell out of here' look, that's kind of how you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm sure you remembered to turn your clock ahead an hour, unless, of course, you're a Democrat working on healthcare. Then you might want to turn it back a year and start all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was thinking about this healthcare problem. If you took all the money the Republicans have spent to stop healthcare and all the money Democrats have spent trying to get healthcare, we could afford healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in 'GQ' magazine, John Edwards' mistress...said she slept with him on the first day they met, but she wasn't his mistress, she was just playing the role. ... And, apparently, the audition went so well, she got the job!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rielle Hunter told 'GQ' that she will love John Edwards until death do us part, to which Elizabeth Edwards said, 'You know, I can arrange that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also said in the interview she did not consider the money she got every month from the Edwards campaign as hush money. .. Well, duh. Once you give an interview, it's no longer hush money. It's now considered down the drain money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is getting ready to vote on President Obama's healthcare bill. It's going to be a close vote. ... The House Democrats say it could be a real tickle fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, out in Arizona, is campaigning with John McCain. He's running for Senate re-election. They're campaigning together out there. I thought, yeah, I mean, there's an unbeatable combination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys see the 'GQ' pictures of John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter? ... Today, she called them 'repulsive', and says she trusted 'GQ&quot;s photographer to take classy photos. Yeah, because anytime I'm on a bed in nothing but dress shirt and underwear next to a Dora the Explorer doll, I think, 'This is gonna look classy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C-SPAN is uploading 23 years of video on the Internet. Or if you want to get the sensation of watching 23 years of C-SPAN, just watch 2 minutes of C-SPAN.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Dennis Kucinich announced he is changing his vote on healthcare. He was against it, now he'll vote for it. He said he changed his mind after President Obama gave him a ride on Air Force One. Is that all it takes to get Kucinich to change his mind? An airplane ride?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a beautiful day here in New York for the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Over 60 degrees outside. I guess that's just luck of the old global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich announced that he will vote for President Obama's healthcare bill. ... The one condition is that Obama had to carry him on his shoulders so he could see the St. Patrick's Day Parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top officials believe that Kim Jong-Il is going to die in the next three years. I was going to send him something, but Hallmark was all out of 'heard experts are predicting your death' cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, President Obama went on Fox News tonight to pitch his plan for healthcare reform. Obama going on Fox News? That's like John Edwards going on 'The Marriage Ref.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich announced he will change his no vote and he will vote yes on healthcare.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 80-year-old Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said he's considering retirement, either that or playing for the Minnesota Vikings next season.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much! Welcome to 'The Tonight Show.' Oh, man. You sound like a bunch of congressmen lining up to get all your freebies to vote yes on healthcare.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, that's the big thing. The big healthcare vote, ladies and gentlemen. You know, it's going to be close. In fact, did you hear President Obama's new slogan? 'Hope this works!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it's starting to get nasty. Today, Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner got in such a heated argument, Boehner missed his appointment at the tanning salon, and she missed her appointment for Botox injections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the mother of that homegrown terrorist, the one they call 'Jihad Jane,' says her daughter only joined a terrorist group because she was lonely and wanted someone to love her.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, the head of the CIA, Leon Panetta, says that Osama bin Laden has been driven deeper and deeper into hiding. The guy's already living in a cave. How much deeper is he going? Is he in a mine shaft?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's now being reported by the 'Wall Street Journal' that Bernard Madoff was assaulted in prison back in December over a dispute over money. I'm stunned. What? Over money? Bernie? I can't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities are investigating this Madoff attack, and they have narrowed the suspects down to everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it said in the paper he was treated for a broken nose, fractured ribs, and cuts to his head and face. The good news for him, of course, he's in prison. So, he gets free healthcare. The bad news for us, we're paying for it. We get screwed again by this guy. Now we're paying for his healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In France, people are appalled that contestants in a fake game show were willing to repeatedly torture a man by giving him what they thought was electric shock until the guy was dead. The show was called 'Be Dick Cheney For A Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys enjoying March Madness? I am so pumped for this weekend. My friends are coming over. We're going to pound some beers, paint our faces, and watch the healthcare vote go down on CSPAN. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some movie news. 'Repo Men' came out today, starring Jude Law as a guy who rips out your internal organs if you can't pay for them. Or, as we call it in the US, 'your insurance company.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of health insurance, the Democrats are working overtime to get 216 votes to pass healthcare on Sunday, which means Rahm Emanuel is prowling the showers like the head of a prison gang. 'You guys vote yet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, healthcare reform was passed by the House last night. Supporters of the bill say the American people now get the same health benefits members of Congress get, which is great.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, not a single Republican voted for the healthcare bill. They claim the US government isn't qualified to be in the healthcare business. Hey, kept Dick Cheney alive the last 30 years. It's got to be worth something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who's going to be in charge of healthcare? The IRS. No, this is true. The IRS will be in charge of enforcing the new healthcare laws.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're getting more details on what happened in the White House after the vote. In fact, the minute it passed, Joe Biden, he was speechless. So, right there the bill is already paying dividends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And before the vote, protestors on Capitol Hill heckled Nancy Pelosi. But she managed to keep a stiff upper lip, as well as a tightly stretched forehead, and an unnaturally arched eyebrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said last night this proves this is a government of the people, and by the people, except for the 55% of the people who opposed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, and the nice thing is, if you lose your job, you know, you're still covered...which is great news for the Democrats in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced, for the first time in the Navy's history, women will be allowed to serve on submarines. See, the problem before was...they didn't want men and women spending time together in such unbelievably cramped quarters. And then they realized, 'Wait a minute, it's no different than flying Southwest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Gallup poll, Congress' approval rating is at an all-time low, 16%. Only 16% of Americans think Congress is doing a good job. The other 84% didn't get any bailout money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the famous jeweler, Tiffany &amp; Company, announced their fourth quarter profits were quadruple what they were this time last year. Experts say it's either a sign the economy is improving or more guys are getting caught cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday...in Washington, DC, history was made. ... Congress actually worked on a Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress passed the healthcare reform bill. Well, that was easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are unhappy about the healthcare bill. ... Americans love paying sky-high medical bills. That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democrats were thrilled, as you can guess. And they got a little rowdy, as Democrats can do. ... They tipped over Rush Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama won one of the great ? they're calling it ? the 'great legislative victories of the last 50 years' last night. He won healthcare reform approval to extend coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, or as the Republicans are calling it, 'Armageddon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anti-healthcare reform protesters outside the Capitol were down right vicious. They yelled the...n-word at black legislators. They yelled the f-word at gay legislators, the w-word at Latino legislators. It was like the 'Sesame Street' of hate out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think it's great. Maybe now, I can finally get a gynecologist to see me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the season premier of season 10 of 'Dancing with the Stars.' It's a smaller cast,&quot; including Buzz Aldrin, whose wife commented &quot;on his chances to win. 'I don't think people realize Buzz is a risk taker.' They don't? He went to the moon, you know, first. In a Toyota, by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Buzz Aldrin, by the way, is 80 years old. How crazy would it be if one of the first men on the moon was killed in a dancing accident?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show'! ... Here's my gift to you. You all have healthcare! It's all on me! You got it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, President Obama signed the landmark healthcare reform bill into law, or as President Obama refers to it, 'The Rush Limbaugh Deportation Act.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, boy, he's feeling like a Toyota driver today. There's no stopping him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how excited the President is. Today, he changed his slogan from 'Yes we can,' to 'Yes we finally did something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the White House is now denying it made any side deals with members of Congress to pass this bill. See, I don't know if that's true. Did you see Mount Rushmore today? They're adding Dennis Kucinich's face to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this all couldn't have been done without the help of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. And today, the President thanked her for her unblinking support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Nancy Pelosi used the Internet to help gain support for this. She reached out to people on her favorite social networking site, Icantmovemyfacebook.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to help sell this plan to the American people, President Obama said it's the same plan Congress has. See, I think that's a mistake. I think that's why a lot of people opposed it. Have you seen members of Congress? Do they look healthy to you? Anybody here want to be as fat as Barney Frank? Huh? You want to be as orange as John Boehner? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, a lot of right wingers are very upset...about this because they believe this healthcare bill will cost a lot of money. You know what I think? Just pretend it's another unnecessary war. You'll feel better about it already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants rallied across the country demanding a path to citizenship. Don't we have a path to citizenship? It's called the San Diego freeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon is changing Army basic training for the first time in 30 years to deal with the fact that so many new recruits are so overweight. ... In fact, the Army's new slogan, 'Don't ask, no seconds.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You people are in such a great mood. I really appreciate it because on a day like this, it's lousy weather. ... Here in New York City, it was 49 and gloomy. You know, like Glenn Beck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks happy about the healthcare bill reform that the Congress has passed? Some people are unhappy about it. A lot of people unhappy about it. Here are two reasons I'm unhappy about it. One, I love paying huge money for healthcare. ... And the other thing, I used to love driving to Canada to buy cheap drugs. I loved that too. I am steamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been very divisive. The Republicans are thinking, 'Okay, all right. We didn't think this was going to go the way it went. Now we really got to get something together. We have to put our heads to this.' They've come up with a great plan that they think has legislative viability to repeal the healthcare reform bill. You know what it is? Four words. Four words. Hot tub time machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about basketball? Anybody here suffering from March Madness? ... Well, don't worry. It's covered by the new healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't let people lie to you. We're not out of this recession. Anybody here think we're out of the recession? No, we're not out of it. We have no money. No jobs. The recession is still going strong. More trouble for the United States economy. The US debt now may lose its triple-A rating. And I said to myself, 'Well, who cares what the auto club thinks?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's coming up is the 2010 Census form. You have to pick up your census form. There will be some changes. First of all, when you hear the Census, you think, oh, please, mind your own business. But you can't have that attitude. You've got to pick up the census form and fill it out. There's changes in the form this year. For example, under gender...you have your choice -- male, female, or gaga. ... It's a third category.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to include everybody in your house. For example, you must include people, even people who just sleep part-time in your house. They have to be included on the Census form. Like Sandra Bullock's husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of a day is it for you? Because I think it is a great day for America! It is. And I'll tell you why. ... Because all day today...Ben and Jerry's was giving out free ice cream. ... And Starbucks was giving out free pastries. Everybody's getting cocky now that there's free health insurance. ... Eat what you like. Diabetes? Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what your political party, this week we saw a great American do something many said couldn't be done. That's right. Buzz Aldrin did the cha-cha on 'Dancing with the Stars,' and that was just something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you guys know, this morning, President Obama signed the healthcare bill into law. ... I know it's exciting, but I still think it was inappropriate to sign it, 'President Barack 'Suck It' Obama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After signing the bill, Obama hugged Nancy Pelosi, twice. He called her one of the best speakers the House has ever had. And then he called Harry Reid one of the best majority leaders the Senate has ever had. Obama is either really excited about healthcare or totally wasted. 'I love you. I'm serious. You're the best. You guys are the best.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hawaii wants to be the location for President Obama's presidential library because that's where he was born and raised. But really, when you go to Hawaii, the first thought that comes to your mind is, 'I got to hit the library,' isn't it? So, it's kind of perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, President Obama signed into law the healthcare bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on Sunday. ... The Republican Party is not happy about the bill. Sen. John McCain told a radio show yesterday that the bill was done in quote, 'the most unsavory Chicago sausage-making' that he's seen in all his years. First of all, I can say from experience that there is nothing unsavory about Chicago sausage. It couldn't be more savory, in fact. And that's not a liberal or conservative point of view. That's an American statement right there, a fat American statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain also said that there will be no cooperation from Republicans for the rest of the year. So that should be good for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a shame to see all that cooperating end, you know? This is like the coyote announcing he's no longer cooperating with the road runner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of crazy. I don't know if I believe this. A new Harris poll found that 57% of Republicans believe President Obama is a Muslim ? 57%. Forty-five percent believe he was not born in the United States. Thirty-eight percent feel he's, quote, 'doing many of the things that Hitler did.' And 24% believe he may be the Antichrist. Oh, like Oprah would date the Antichrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's ridiculous: 38%...believe he's like Hitler? How is that possible? He doesn't even have a mustache. How could he be like Hitler? Did Hitler play basketball? No, seriously, did Hitler play basketball?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have the way to pay for healthcare. ... A cuss jar. Every time Joe Biden says the f-word, he has to put a dollar in it. ... It pays for itself in a week.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, when Joe Biden was introducing the President of the United States, he said the f-word into an open microphone. And you know, people make a big deal about it, but if you think about it, this is probably the least embarrassing thing Biden has said since becoming Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama didn't seem that bothered by it. ... The only f-word that's banned in the White House, of course, is Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'Men's Health' magazine...21% of men surveyed would rather have a sexier nurse than a more competent doctor when they're in the hospital. ... I say, why not have both? The government's paying for it now. Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin spoke out this week against the healthcare reform bill, saying, 'Elections have consequences.' Well, of course, elections have consequences. That's why right now, instead of being Vice President of the United States, she's trying to get a reality show on the Animal Planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now looking into whether cosmic rays from outer space could be responsible for causing Priuses to accelerate. ... What, is Toyota blaming Klingons now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something amazing. A North Carolina jury, this week, awarded $9 million to a jilted wife, from the other woman. The other woman has to pay $9 million to the wife for breaking up her marriage. Wait, do you realize how historic this is? Guys, for the first time in history, women are agreeing it's not the guy's fault. It's her fault! ... This is what men have been saying for years. Poor John Edwards. He was tricked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, hey, are you ready for the...2010 Census? It's going to be complicated this year. So the government should have patience. Here's part of the problem. Most Americans count as two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you filled out a Census form. Here's the deal. Ten questions in ten minutes. That's what they're saying. ... Coincidentally, that is how John McCain chose his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You got to count everybody in your household for the Census. Right now, Angelina Jolie is going through the place with one of those clickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Jersey Shore' is premiering in 30 different countries this week. It will be shown in France, except in France it's called 'Another Reason to Hate America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you missed it, at the healthcare bill signing yesterday, Vice President Joe Biden introduced the President, then turned to him and said, 'This is a big f'ing deal.' ... Joe Biden, C-SPAN shouldn't have bloopers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time Joe Biden is on TV, it's like the White House Def Jam. You can't let Joe Biden talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced today that the Pentagon will ease up on its enforcement of the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama's out on the road selling his healthcare plan to the American people. One of the biggest criticisms of this almost 3,000 page bill is it's so complicated, it's so complex, nobody really understands it. To give you an idea of how confusing this healthcare bill is, more Americans now understand the plot of 'Lost.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, in Arizona, John McCain and Sarah Palin appeared together at a campaign rally. Sarah Palin gave her standard stump speech, which means you ask her a question and she's stumped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know why she's at this campaign rally? Well, it's kind of sad. They still haven't told McCain the election is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. At a breakfast panel discussion hosted by the US Capitol Historical Society, Texas US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison...said women senators do not cheat on their husbands because they don't have the time. That's what I love about politicians. There's no moral problem with adultery, it's just a matter of scheduling and multitasking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was at a bookstore in Iowa yesterday, and he bought a $37 pop-up book for Press Secretary Robert Gibbs' son.

Yes, I am calling collect.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he was at the bookstore, Obama also picked up books by Mitt Romney and Karl Rove and held them up to the media. And then he made their author photos make out for like five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan this past weekend. I guess after the last 14 months in Washington, he wanted to go someplace where there was less fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty quick trip. In fact, it happened so fast, Joe Biden didn't even have a chance to say something stupid about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a rough couple of weeks for Vice President Joe Biden. First he blessed the Irish prime minister's dead mother, who was not dead. ... Then he used the f-word when he introduced the President. Finally some good news. Over the weekend, Joe Biden was nominated for the Dan Quayle Lifetime Achievement Award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, as you know, the people have spoken, but healthcare passed anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is now preparing to pass yet another jobs bill. You know how to create more jobs in this country? Fire the people that wrote the first jobs bill. That obviously didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released a new audiotape in which he threatens to kill Americans. You know, as opposed to his earlier, new age motivational tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the FBI is now saying that al Qaeda may be planning an attack on a US sports stadium. See, I don't think al Qaeda, though, has any idea about our sports. You know what their big plan is? To hit Wrigley Field during the World Series.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over in Afghanistan, the US military is now using...pilotless drones to attack al Qaeda. Do you know what those are? It's a plane that doesn't have any pilot. It's flown by remote control by somebody on the ground. Or as Southwest calls that, 'the next step.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin had a weekend for her: Changing diapers; opening up jars of baby food; cutting meat into little pieces. Just another day campaigning with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And unemployment in Florida hit a record high of 12.2 percent. You want to know how bad it is down there? Today, the Coast Guard picked up 50 Cubans off the coast of Miami trying to swim back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of President Obama's Trip To Afghanistan: &quot;10. The welcoming chants of 'death to America!' 9. Using miles to get bumped up to business class. 8. Picking up sexy negligee for Michelle at Mahboba's Secret. 7. Playing a little one-on-one with Hamid Karzai. 6. Seeing 'Hot Tub Time Machine' dubbed in Pashto. 5. Military demonstration of new secret weapon: A ground-to-air goat. 4. The splendor of Kabul in the springtime. 3. Catching Jon Lovitz at the new Kandahar comedy club, Laffghanistan. 2. Spotting a confused John McCain arguing with a falafel. 1. Leaving Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? President Obama, big surprise visit to see the folks in Afghanistan. Did you read all about that? That's kind of exciting. It turns out he was shooting an episode of 'Undercover Boss.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He met with...Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, but Karzai was late for the meeting. ... You know why he was late for the meeting? He had transportation trouble. ... The accelerator on his camel...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was an important meeting. Both presidents agreed that we have to work to wipe out terror networks. Get rid of terror networks, like al Qaeda, the Taliban, Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama demanded more accountability. He said we got to have more accountability, we got to have a crackdown on corruption; we have to have a better government. And he said if it works...in Afghanistan, we're going to try it back home in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is out campaigning now again? John McCain and his buddy Sarah Palin. ... I mean, come on, it worked so well the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin...was campaigning in a, you know, a motorcycle jacket. ... She looks like somebody Jesse James would date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Governor Sarah Palin has been very busy. She's been campaigning for select Republicans, including John McCain, who's in the middle of a tough Senate race in Arizona. How does he introduce her? 'And now, the young woman who cost me the Presidency, Sarah Palin!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare's free now! ... America as we know it is dead. You now who else is dead? Your nana and your peepop. Don't believe me? Well maybe you'll believe the friendly friends over at 'Fox and Friends.' 'It's not a scene out of a Hitchcock movie. It's reality at a retirement community. Hundreds of vultures taking up residence at the Sun City Community in...Texas.' Vultures circling the elderly! ... Clearly...these guys have heard about Obama's death panels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Passover, everybody. ... Speaking of that, as you may have heard, Vice President Joe Biden did it again. ... He showed up at the White House Seder last night with a bunch of ham sandwiches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'Newsweek,' the FBI now says Osama bin Laden is healthy and giving the orders once again for al Qaeda. ... Today, Republicans blamed it on the new healthcare bill.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Michelle Obama attended the Kids' Choice Awards over the weekend. See, I don't think the President had ever seen that show. Like, when she got home, the President asked Michelle how it went. She said there was a lot of slime. And President Obama said, 'Fox News was there?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele -- you probably heard about this -- he got in a lot of trouble. I guess they dropped over $2,000 to staffers at a topless bondage theme nightclub right here in Hollywood. ... And what's the Republicans' big issue right now? Isn't it -- oh, yeah -- cutting down on wasteful spending?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Steele. Doesn't he sound like he would be a dancer at a bondage theme nightclub?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Republican National Committee Excuses: &quot;10. 'Hey, we're fat, dumb rich guys. 'Nuff said?' 9. 'Thought 'SM' door was Sen. McCain's office.' 8. 'It wasn't a sex club, just a regular club where grown men tickle each other.' 7. 'Scott Brown raved about the place.' 6. 'The Sheraton's meeting rooms were already booked.' 5. 'I'm sorry, Ricky Martin is gay?' 4. 'Abraham Lincoln routinely spent $2,000 a night in sex clubs.' 3. 'Hey, we're fat, dumb rich guys. 'Nuff said?' 2. 'If we don't spend donor money at a sex club, the terrorists have won.' 1. 'Research for pending legislation, 'No Stripper Left Behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's a...fascinating story. And this kind of thing happens all the time. But every time it happens, we always say, 'Whoa, here we go.' ... The Republican National Committee had a big party at some kind of a sex club in Los Angeles. They spent $2,000 of campaign donation money on the bill at the sex club in Los Angeles. ... But the guy who organized the big Republican sex party...apologized on the Golf Channel, so that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pamela Anderson on Dancing with the Stars'. ... You know who else is on 'Dancing with the Stars'? Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin. ... Pam Anderson and Buzz Aldrin. Honest to God, it looks like a Republican ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the 'Today' show this morning, President Obama said that adjustments will need to be made to the new healthcare law. In fact, it's getting so many adjustments, Obama's now calling it the Heidi Montag of congressional bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the same interview, President Obama said that his family has decided not to join any one, single church, because he causes too much of a disruption at services. ... At the last service, the priest was like, 'In the name of the Father, the Son and holy cow, the President!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thursday is Census deadline day. ... The census would like every resident of the United States to fill out their form and mail it in. If you don't know how many people live in your house, just count the number of iPods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And remember, you know, the Census Bureau sends a Census taker to any home that doesn't reply by mail. So unless you want to have a conversation with another human being, you better get that in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain, a year and a half ago he was on top. His party's candidate for president. He plucked an unknown Alaska governor to be Eliza Doolittle to his Henry Higgins. Smash cut to today. McCain struggling to retain a narrow lead in a surprisingly tight Senate primary against arch-conservative talk show host J.D. Hayworth. Yes! That J.D. Hayworth. The one you've never heard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the problem. No matter what Sarah Palin is saying about John McCain, she can't help but make him look bad. Just by sitting next to her. ... No matter what she's saying, she's full of life and vibrant. The viewer at home's not even listening. It just sounds like this to them: 'Yeah, I found this man wandering at the mall. If he looks familiar to anyone, please contact me.' ... You know, the whole thing, it just doesn't look right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a Tea Party rally in Nevada, Sarah Palin encouraged angry people to 'take back our country.' From who? No one should say take our country back unless you are addressing a tribe of Native Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some good news for us. ... Iran's top nuclear scientist has defected to the CIA and is now here in the United States. He's now on our side.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Sarah Palin will be doing some kind of reality show on cable. They say her exact role on the show is unknown, kind of like when she campaigned for McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see John McCain with Sarah Palin next to him over the weekend? At first I thought it was Buzz Aldrin on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Highlights Of Barack Obama's Oil Drilling Plan.&quot;: &quot;10. Everyone in America gets a free Sunoco travel mug. 9. Promises not to kill any endangered animals except the really tasty ones. 8. Kids drill free. 7. Drilling won't affect Scott Brown's visits to the beach. 6. Most extensive exploratory undertaking since Harry Smith's colonoscopy. 5. What? What? Ricky Martin's gay? 4. Fifty barrels of oil reserved each year for Mitt Romney's hair ? zing! 3. Boys at Halliburton seem happy, which is good enough for us! 2. Provision for drilling the sun for solar power. 1. Drilling will begin in Glenn Beck's yard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's coming back to town? ... King Tut. ... His mummified remains...will be on display here in New York City. And I was thinking, yeah, big deal. ... I mean, if you want mummified remains, watch Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a fascinating story. The Republican National Committee got together and said, 'You know, boys, things are going so well for us here lately, let's have a party.' So...they said, 'Well, yeah, but we don't want to pay for it.' And they said, 'No ... We'll get the Republican National Committee to pay for it -- money that we get from donations and contributions. We'll let the folks pay for it.' And everybody said, 'Great, what do we do?' And they said, 'Well, let's go to Los Angeles to a sex club.' And they said, 'Great!' So they end up there at a bondage club in Los Angeles. ... And I thought...that makes perfect sense&quot; because Republicans &quot;love tying things up: Healthcare, you know; climate control; financial reform...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know in Switzerland, in Geneva, scientists are celebrating? They have a multimillion dollar atom-smasher that has given us new information on how the universe began. Couldn't these scientists save some money and just ask Larry King?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys hear about this? Sarah Palin has a new Fox News series, which is being described as a show about people with real life tales of overcoming adversity.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced this week that he is opening more sites for offshore oil drilling. Do you know what that means? If we find enough oil, we could one day invade ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my favorite story of the week. The Republican National Committee is in trouble after spending nearly $2,000 at a...bondage club in Hollywood. You know what I call a Republican that spends a lot of money in a strip club? A Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, one eyewitness said 'some of the things going on in the club were almost too masochistic for the Republicans to watch.' .. Like in one room, there was a video being played over and over of President Obama signing the healthcare bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's another deal going on over at the Jacob Javitz Center. It's the annual New York City Auto Show. I like the new tiny cars. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under President Obama's new airport security plan, anyone traveling to the US will be stopped if they match the description of a potential terrorist. Wait, we weren't doing this already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Obama gave a speech at the Boston Opera House. It was a long night, because you know what they say about the opera: 'It ain't over until the fat lady gets lectured on her eating habits by Michelle Obama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is interesting. President Obama unveiled a new gas mileage program that he says is like taking 58 million cars off the road for an entire year. Or as Toyota calls it, 'business as usual.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More car news. Ford is teaming up with Microsoft to create an all electric car called the Microsoft Hohm. That's smart, because if there's one company that knows how to avoid crashes, it's Microsoft.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a man in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, last week was charged with public drunkenness after cops caught him giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a flattened, roadkill opossum. ... Look, I know Obama's healthcare is supposed to include everybody. But look, this is crazy. It's too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS says it's been getting death threats since the healthcare bill passed because the IRS is going to be the ones in charge of implementing it. They say the threats people are making to the IRS are so bad, that they are actually hindering the IRS' ability to threaten people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, Sarah Palin gave a speech in Nevada where she criticized President Barack Obama for being a constitutional law professor. .. The problem with that statement is Sarah Palin thinks that's an insult. Only in America, you want to insult someone, call them a teacher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals home opener against the Philadelphia Phillies. And then Vice President Joe Biden was thrown out for cursing at the umpire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama didn't actually...throw the ball. He got it to the catcher's mitt through a series of back door dealings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals game. Obama took a short windup and threw a high-arcing pitch. Of course, Democrats saw the pitch as moderately close to the middle, while Republicans are calling it 'way to the left and possibly socialist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, a prominent Filipino businessman quit his job at a major university after admitting that he made a speech plagiarizing Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and J.K. Rowling. People got suspicious after he opened with the line, 'Look under your seats, muggles, because everyone is going home with a free hope and change!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President and Mrs. Obama hosted the annual White House Easter Egg Roll today. Dozens of children gathered on the White House lawn to roll eggs towards a finish line while the President cheered them on and Republicans tried to block them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, Michelle Obama's pet project is raising awareness of childhood obesity, so they didn't just roll eggs this year. They rolled a few fat kids to make an example of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then later this afternoon, the President threw out the first pitch at the season opener for the Washington Nationals. You know, baseball has started again. The last time the President...threw out a first pitch was at the All-Star game last year, which was notable, mostly because he was wearing his famous mom jeans when he did it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisely, the President decided to donate those lady pants to the Smithsonian. And today, he sported a pair of gray slacks. The pants were better but the pitch wasn't. That was more like a free throw than a pitch. Maybe his pitching power was stored in that pair of mom jeans, and now, like Samson without his pony tail, his strength is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Healthcare reform isn't perfect...but perhaps the one change we can all agree is a positive step is that now insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children with preexisting medical conditions. ... 'Some insurance companies believe they have already found a loophole.' But why?! Why are you looking?! You may have found it, but why would you look for a loophole for that? Are you worried that when you go to hell, you'd only be taking the local and you want to make sure you're going to be on the express?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Obama and the Democrats have passed healthcare, the issue of gays in the military is back on the table. Only now, it's a rustic but elegant...dining room table from Restoration Hardware.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'd like to take a moment to remind America of exactly who this retiring justice even is. Justin John Paul Stevens began his career as a revolutionary war naval captain, then moved on to pursue his passion -- playing bass for Led Zeppelin. Following a string of hits, John Paul Stevens then became the Pope, where his love of robes soon led him to be a judge or the Supreme Court, where he was able to overturn a longstanding rule against him pitching for the Cubs. Did you see that? That was John Paul Stevens actually throwing a pitch out with the Cubs when he was 85 years old. Not for nothing, can we get the split screen of Stevens' pitch with Obama's from last week. Ninety-year-old man, Mr. President. Fired a heater down the middle. I'm just saying, you might want to lay low until they come up with some kind of tossing out the first three-pointer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figure is a little bit misleading because most of that money is Alaskan currency, which is primarily made up of pelts and shiny rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes...the future looks bright, but that doesn't mean we can forget our past. In fact, we need to re-remember it. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell agrees with me.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the media, for some reason, can only focus on what Governor McDonnell initially left out of his declaration. 'I'm talking about that proclamation by Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, the proclamation that failed to even mention the cause of the Civil War.' 'Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia making April Confederate History Month, but not mentioning anything about slavery.' Hey, there are only 30 days in April. Day 31 would have been 'Mention Slavery Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a week later, he caved in to the forces of 'Big Slave' and shamefully sullied the heritage of the Confederacy with historical accuracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, lest we forget, we still have a war going on in Afghanistan, and unfortunately the situation there is getting worse for American troops. 'At the end of the month, Burger King, Popeyes, and Pizza Hut are getting their discharge papers when a fast food ban takes effect at bases in Afghanistan.' What?! Without deep-fried food, will they even remember what they're fighting for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And don't tell me these food deliveries are taking up cargo space that could be used for ammunition. I'm sure we could kill the Taliban with P'Zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration's top science and technology official has warned the United States cannot expect to be number one in science and technology forever. Did you know we were number one now? If we're number one in technology, why do I have to call India for tech support, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon says that al Qaeda is now in financial ruin. I tell you, Goldman Sachs, they screwed everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, al Qaeda should have seen it coming. You know who's in charge of the finances? Osama ben Bernanke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' America may experience a serious doctor shortage. ... Does that mean we don't have enough doctors or we don't have enough serious doctors? 'I like my doctor, he's just not very serious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is launching a new $6 billion space policy that will ultimately take astronauts to Mars. Of course, it's six billion and $45 if the astronauts have a carry-on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama says the new $6 billion program will let us engage in deeper space exploration, while Biden says this will let us engage in open dialogue with Alf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yahoo is producing a daily video series, based on its most popular news stories, in partnership with Toyota. Of course, they're having a tough time getting the site up because it always ends up crashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, our attorney general...said he's going to investigate whether a university foundation that hired Sarah Palin to give a speech violated public disclosure laws. They had some controversy. Some students found her contract rider in a dumpster.&quot; That is &quot;a list of demands a performer has when they appear somewhere. Usually you see them for, like, rock stars, but Sarah Palin has one, I guess. ... Among other things,&quot; Palin's rider &quot;requires two first class tickets from Alaska or a private jet from Alaska, nothing smaller than a Lear 60, and it has to have a window she can shoot out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has to have three hotel rooms, a wooden podium, not Plexiglas, two bottles of water, and best of all, I think, a supply of bendable straws. This is a complicated woman. On one hand, you know, she'll blow a moose's head off at 300 yards, but on the other, bendy straws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, President Obama will be in Florida to announce his vision for America's space program. The rumor is that he is going to reverse President Bush's space policy, which centered around sending a giant caulk gun to the moon to fill all the craters up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, sent a letter to Obama criticizing him because he's expected to cut funding for manned space flights. And he even helped spearhead this ad campaign that I guess is designed to convince President Obama to change his mind on this. ... 'For nearly half a century, the United States has been a world leader in exploring the final frontier: First to the moon, inspiring a nation, and paving the way for countless advancements in science. President Obama's plan to cut NASA's budget means never again will Americans see astronauts suck Jell-O through a straw, eat floating bananas, or doing funny experiments with a frog. Write President Obama. Don't let these super fun times come to an end. This message paid for by astronauts who love super fun times in space.' Powerful stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Palin continues her whistle stop tour of Realmerica, eventual ex-President Obama continues to arrogantly defy his lack of a mandate by doing things. 'In Washington tonight, 47 world leaders have gathered for a summit on the most serious of topics -- nuclear security.' ... This meeting of was called to find the way to eliminate the threat posed by nuclear weapons. It was the most heads of states convened by a US president since the U.N. General Assembly was established more than 60 years ago. And what was that assembly's very first resolution? It was, I kid you not, the establishment 'of a commission to deal with' the 'elimination of atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, I just want you to know, the main goal for Obama's meeting was to try and get an agreement on sanctions against Iran. That, did not happen. Did anything? 'The first statement that we heard yesterday from Ukraine, that it would eliminate over 150 kilograms of highly enriched uranium.' ... All right, so, several bit of significant news out of the summit. I wonder which piece America's number one news network will focus on. 'If you look at the nuclear security summit logo, what does that have in common with all those other flags there representing Muslim nations?' They're round? They...have, like, round shapes? They're all on the same screen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'That's the same thing that you see on the flags of Turkey, Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan. And what do they all have in common? They're all Muslim nations. So his claim is that the President deliberately put this as a logo to try and continue his outreach to Muslim nations in a positive way. So you be the judge.' ... We called the White House to find out the genesis of the nuclear summit logo. ... They say that the inspiration for the logo is actually the Rutherford?Bohr model of the atom that we all learned about in high school. So...it turns out&quot; the &quot;people at the White House are not secret Muslims. They're nerds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is April the 15th. This is a day we all curse like Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama released his tax return today. He didn't owe a lot in taxes. He has a lot of dependents. He's got his wife, two daughters, AIG, General Motors; Goldman Sachs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you probably heard about this on the news. Now being reported that the terrorist organization al Qaeda is in financial ruin. ... To give you an idea what bad shape they're in, today I saw a terrorist buying a shoe bomb at Payless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, do you know this story? Toyota has stopped selling their Lexus SUV because it poses a high risk of rolling over. ... But according to a Zogby poll, 62% of Americans believe that Toyotas are safe or safer than other vehicles. The other 38% are still in critical condition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A giant cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland has stopped air traffic all across Europe. ... The airlines are jumping all over this. They're now charging passengers a $400 volcanic ash cloud fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers found that you are more likely get germs from money than any other object. ... Really? Then how come poor people aren't healthier?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a Tea Party rally in Boston yesterday, Sarah Palin praised the crowd for winning that Senate race in Massachusetts. She said, 'Shoot, look at what you did in January. You shook up the United States Senate.' Unfortunately, no one heard the Senate thing, because after she said 'shoot,' 300 guns went off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the same rally, Sarah Palin said, 'Let me ask you, Massachusetts. Do you love your freedom?' ... Is anyone going to say 'no' to that? It's like going to a Phish show and saying, 'Anyone here like getting high and eating grilled cheese?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the conservative Tea Party political movement that's been, if not sweeping the nation, certainly sweeping the nation's news coverage, is doing that because it has everything the media loves, from charismatic leaders backseat presidentin' to middle American Main Street cred, from colorful costumes to a compellingly divisive narrative, and of course, the occasional...idiot. 'Obama lied, our country died.' ... Worst Dr. Seuss book ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, as a Libertarian, I believe the government has very few legitimate roles -- national defense and not asking what's hidden at my compound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I do have a bit of soft spot for one government program ? the space program. In fact, you know, when the weather gets warm like this, I just like to lean back and look up and just drink all that in. Isn't that beautiful? And now just imagine there's no concrete ceiling in the way. That'd be pretty nice, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why last week I drew a space-line in the moon dust over Obama's plan to scale back the space program. 'President Obama's 2011 budget scraps the Constellation program. Nation, this is the end of manned American spaceflight. The very last shuttle launch is this September. What are they going to do with all those shuttles? Convert them into a chain of theme restaurants called Cr?pe Canaveral?' Although, I would love to try an Apollo-pe?o popper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well guess who's riding my coattails? First man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, last man on the moon, Eugene Cernan, and Apollo 13's Jim Lovell, who published a letter criticizing Obama's decision. He is really catching major heat over cutting funding for NASA. ... Evidently, Barack Obama felt the heat I was bringing. Today, he gave a speech at the Kennedy Space Center. 'Nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space, than I am. By the mid 2030's, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.' I saved the space program!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, a big setback for NASA. President Obama cutting the space program of sending men to the moon. ... . Although he can point to one big achievement during his time in office. We did put an astronaut on 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials now say that the two most senior leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq have been killed in a joint US-Iraqi mission. I believe the names were 'what's his face' and 'the guy who plays the guy who replaced the guy we killed last week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, we can't take all the credit. What happened was the Lexus GX 460 rolled over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to sources at the Pentagon, al Qaeda is nearing financial ruin. But ironically, their top people still got their million dollar bonuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda is broke. How ironic is that? Al Qaeda would run out of moolah. Isn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is going on with Goldman Sucks? Goldman Sachs. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, just four day after Goldman Sachs cost investors $12 billion by failing to tell them that they're being investigated for fraud, they gave out another $5.4 billion in bonuses. Huh? Even Somali pirates are going, 'Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's an amazing fact. Sarah Palin made $12 million last year. ... In fact, Sarah Palin had such a good year, she was actually able to quit her part-time job as governor of Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry king has filed for divorce. ... The...rumor going around is that Larry's wife left him for a younger man, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am aware that the only reason you people are here tonight is volcanic ash. ... Thank God I still have my swine flu mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry King getting another divorce. ... Had an affair with his sister-in-law but in his defense -- there is always another side to the story -- in his defense, at his age, you know, it's hard to remember which sister he's married to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Airports from London to Warsaw are on their sixth day of shutdown. ... The airports are closed because a volcano is erupting. Smoke and ash are spreading over Europe. The smoke cloud is big and thick. Meteorologists originally thought it was coming from Willie Nelson's tour bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, the volcano on the tiny island of Iceland has shut down air traffic. ... President Obama had to cancel his trip to Poland. President Obama said he hopes the volcano will stop smoking soon and the volcano said the same thing about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, we've all got to make some cash fast, folks, because Obama is determined to destroy Wall Street with his oppressive financial regulations, all in the name of protecting the consumer from risky investments. ... Thankfully, folks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell got all 41 Republican senators to sign a letter opposing the bill. Because this bill is broken, folks. Just listen to Massachusetts senator and human-truck hybrid Scott Brown passionately explain to a reporter exactly what Brown would fix in this bill. 'Well, what areas do you think should be fixed? I mean, you know, tell me.' Truly a man of his convictions, once you tell him what they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But just when it looked like the Republicans had stopped this bill dead, Obama's Security and Exchange Commission dropped this bombshell. 'The story everybody is talking about tonight is, of course, Goldman Sachs, the original 'too big to fail' firm. The mega firm was charged with fraud by the SEC.' Why are government employees filing a civil suit against Goldman Sachs? That's just going to be embarrassing in a few years, when they all go back to work at Goldman Sachs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the liberal media always, always gets a charge out of attacking Goldman Sachs. In 'Rolling Stone', Matt Taibbi called Goldman '...a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity...' Wrong, Matt. Goldman is not a vampire. It also feeds during the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what, what exactly did the Feds accuse Goldman of doing here? Ali Velshi, CNN's business reporter from our raceless, hairless future explains. 'Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs is accused of selling mortgage-backed securities that were essentially set up to lose money. Allegedly, the deals were put together in part by a hedge fund tycoon who was betting against them.' What's the problem? There's nothing illegal about selling customers a product designed to fail. The Chicago Cubs do it every year. Are they going to jail? No, I do not think that they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, here's how it allegedly worked -- allegedly: An independent hedge fund manager named John Paulson created an investment made up of mortgage bonds he believed would fail. Goldman agreed to sell this to investors, like German banks and pension funds, without telling them it was crap. Meanwhile, Goldman bought insurance betting against the bonds, and when they failed, like they knew it would, Goldman and Paulson cashed in and then celebrated by stepping on a baby's throat. It's okay. ... They also took out insurance on the baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story everyone is talking about is Iceland and the eruption of their volcano, Eyjafjallajokull, which evidently is Icelandic for 'you will be sleeping in the airport.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Flights all over Europe are cancelled, and the airlines are losing roughly $200 million a day, so financially, they're doing better than usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Pentagon, al Qaeda is in financial ruin. And as a result, some of the terrorists are so depressed, they have lost the will to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Robert Cheruiyot of Kenya. He won the 114th running of the Boston Marathon yesterday.... And of course, since the guy from Kenya won, well now, the Republicans are demanding to see his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Goldman Sachs Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Huh?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. You're saying 'fraud' like it's a bad thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Planned on using money to buy everyone in America delicious KFC Double Down sandwich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Distraught over George Lopez's move to midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. We were framed by evil menswear company Goldman Slacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since when are financial institutions not allowed to screw their customers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Hey sport, how much to make these questions go away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. America needed a villain both Republicans and Democrats can hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Everyone we ripped off got an 'I Got Cheated By Goldman Sachs' tote bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Uhh, it's Obama's fault?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody from Iceland? Well, it's volcano season up there. ... And the big volcano cloud...blowing now toward Russia. As a matter of fact, Sarah Palin says she can see it from her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great day for America&quot; but &quot;another bad day for...air travel. A second giant smoke cloud shooting into the sky. Air traffic controllers say it's no longer safe to fly anywhere near Woody Harrelson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ballad of the unstoppable monkey continues. ... There's a monkey in Florida that escaped from somewhere. Nobody seems to know where. But it's been running wild for a year. No one can catch it. They tried to trap it. They shot it with darts, to no avail. See, that's the thing about Florida. If this happened in Alaska, the monkey would be hanging on Sarah Palin's wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since their beginning, the Tea Party's been accused of racism. 'The Tea Party in general is overwhelmingly white.' 'Is the Tea Party for white folks only?' 'The conservative movement has now crystallized into the white power movement.' That is slander, Miss Garofalo! Tea Partiers aren't white. They're just average Joes, regular Norman Rockwell, hard working, blue collar types who wear SPF 50 and shoot free throws underhand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they only want one thing. 'We're taking our country back.' 'They want their country back.' 'It's about taking back our country.' Yes, it's our country, not theirs, and we are taking it back from them. You know, them -- those people who steal. There's nothing racist about it. Just some of them steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the liberal media have seized on a few isolated incidents to make all Tea Partiers look bad. For instance,&quot; on &quot;March 20th, three black congressmen, including civil rights leader John Lewis, claimed a group of Tea Party protesters called them the N-word. Now, I'm not a racist, so I don't know what the N-word is. Okay, I'm going to go with niblets. First off, that sounds delicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And second off, they're clearly lying. 'There's no tape with the N-word on it. There's no ? wait! Let's be clear. There's no tape!' 'It's not on tape.' 'There is no tape of it.' No tape! And racists always tape their racial slurs. You don't want to forget baby's first N-word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, guess who else is calling the Tea Party white? Facts. A 'New York Times' poll of Tea Partiers show they are 89% white people and 1% black people, with margin of error of black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the government said today Somali pirates being held in US custody will be brought to the United States for prosecution and they will be tried by a jury of their peers. So I'm guessing that's what, Goldman Sachs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this on the news? Gay and lesbian activists chained themselves to the White House fence to protest the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. And when Republican Party officials saw the lesbians chaining themselves to the fence, out of force of habit, they paid $2,000 to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that fewer and fewer immigrants are sending money they earn here back home. They'd like to but there's no one left at home. They all live here now. They just send it across the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is rather disturbing. A government panel made up of all retired military personnel says that the school lunches are a threat to our national security because they make our kids too fat to serve the country. It's unbelievable. Remember the old days, when the Army wanted the best and the brightest? Now they're stuck with the biggest and the widest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something great. General Motors today paid back all the government loans five years ahead of schedule. ... Amazing what hard work, careful planning, and Toyotas rolling over and crashing into trees can do for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And unemployment here in California, over 12% now. ... Give you an idea how bad it is, you know the best way to make money in California now? Marrying and divorcing Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in an interview on the 'Today' show, Bill Clinton told Jenna Bush Hager, who's...George Bush's daughter, that his only involvement in the planning of his daughter Chelsea's wedding is paying the bill. ... Although, since he's a Democrat, he doesn't actually pay the bill himself, he leaves it for future generations of Americans. But you get the idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talking about air travel and the volcano. The good news, ladies and gentlemen, regular airline service is resuming. ... The bad news -- regular airline service is resuming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The airlines lost $2 billion. ... Usually all they lose is my luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was 4/20, known to stoners around the country as National Weed Day. There were pro-marijuana legalization rallies all around the country, especially here in California, where freedom fighters like this guy exercised their right to free speech vigorously. 'Here in the meadow, people were chilling out. Some, maybe too much.' 'We're here just to have a bunch of fun in a field.' That's a good way to spend a Tuesday, while your parents are paying tuition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our British brethren will soon go to the polls to determine whether Tory David Cameron, Labor's Gordon Brown, or the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg will have the privilege of acquiescing to whatever demand is made of them to benefit American interests. Ha-ha! Someone has to say it! USA! USA! USA!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has yet to fulfill his promise that he would end the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' ban on gay service members. It's a fact he was reminded of when he spoke in California earlier this week on behalf of Sen. Barbara Boxer. 'She's passionate about fighting for California's families.' 'End 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot; 'She is ? we are do ? we are going to do that. Hey, hold on a second. Hold on a second. We are going to do that. ... When you've got an ally like Barbara Boxer and you've got an ally like me, who are standing for the same thing, then you don't know exactly why you've got to holler, because we already hear you.' ... You don't know why liberal activists have to holler? You don't spend much time with you liberal activists, do you? Hollering is their inside voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They use it when ordering chai. 'What do we want? Soy milk! When do we want it? Whenever you can deliver it in an environmentally sustainable fashion!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, on the Republican side, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is talking about cooperating with Democrat Chuck Schumer on a compromise plan to reform immigration laws. It's angered activists on the right, like this fella, speaking at a Tea Party rally in Graham's home state of South Carolina over the weekend. 'I don't care about your private life, Lindsey. But as our US senator, I need to figure out why you're trying to sell out your own countrymen, and I need to make sure you being gay isn't it.' Did you just link the possibility of Lindsey Graham being gay to being the reason he wants to reform immigration law? You know gay's not a nationality, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think Lindsey Graham is encouraging looser immigration laws so that his fellow natives of Gayslyvania can sneak across the rainbow bridge for a better life?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I don't know anything about Lindsey Graham's sexuality. I don't care. But this guy should know he's playing a dangerous game here. Everyone knows if a Republican comes out of a closet and sees a gay shadow, it means six more years of a Democratic administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it is Immigrant Heritage Week here in New York City, when New Yorkers honor each other's unique cultural ways of avoiding eye contact on the subway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this celebration reminds us that despite our different backgrounds, there is one belief that unites all Americans -- the Mexicans are coming!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now you may not be hearing much about it now, but after the banking bill, immigration reform will be the next topico muy caliente en Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot enact immigration reform without first fixing our broken borders. We've tried everything to keep illegals out, from volunteer Minutemen to lining the border with our crappiest states. But nothing...is working.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' 71% of American households have already filled out and returned their census. That's the good news. ... The bad news -- they filled it out in Spanish.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama met with Wall Street executives today. He told them to stop fighting this financial reform.&quot; But the &quot;Wall Street executives&quot; are &quot;kind of copping an attitude with the President. You know, I got an idea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yeah. They don't want the government messing with their business unless it's a bailout. Then, 'Please!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how popular President Obama is around the world ? he's probably the most popular leader in the world -- this is amazing.

Here's the amazing thing ? hasn't even opened yet and already $12 trillion in debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, a lot of people were flying and got delayed by the Icelandic volcano and everybody is upset. They lost billions of dollars in revenue.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a story that is kind of perplexing: 221 years ago, George Washington went to the library here in New York, took out some books, never returned them. ... Two hundred twenty one years of overdue library fines. I tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to blame this economic crisis on a president, what about that guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's news now from the Supreme Court. Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring. He's in his 90s, Justice John Paul Stevens. Said he has had enough, wants to spend more time judging his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in the SEC, or as they call it now, the 'Sexual Exchange Commission.' Do you know about this? ... This is unbelievable. New reports showed that during that last big economic crisis, you know, the whole meltdown thing, employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission used government computers to look at porn. And, ironically, while they were looking at pornography, the other employees were watching Goldman Sachs screw the entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, President Obama gave a speech in New York City about his plan to reform these rules on Wall Street, you know? And one embarrassing moment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you probably heard about this. Both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden took some heat for flying separately to New York City last week because it was Earth Day, and they got heat for flying on two separate planes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest anti-immigration bill into law. It's unbelievable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, the Yankees, they're champions. In Arizona, they would be deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a nice story. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle took the weekend off. ... They went hiking in North Carolina. ... Had a great time. And so he wouldn't get lost,&quot; Obama &quot;left behind a trail of cigarette butts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's...nice when a politician says he's hiking the Appalachian Trail and he actually is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's memoir is coming out November 9th. ... On the cover, Bush is wearing a dark suit and holding a briefing book with his head slightly turned from the camera, or as Bush calls it, 'posing all serious- like.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the book is called 'Decision Points', and 1,000 signed, cloth-bound copies will be sold for $350 each. Each...one&quot; will say, &quot;'Thanks for reading about my decisions. Sincerely, Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush's memoirs going to be titled 'Decision Points.' That sounds like the reward system that was used to get Bush to do things when he was in office, doesn't it? 'So, if I sign that paper with the law on it, how many decision points do I get? Like, five decision points, six? Last Wednesday, I got a silver star and a smiley face.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arizona...recently passed the toughest anti-immigration bill in American history. The idea behind this bill is to drive...illegal immigrants out of Arizona and back to their homeland of Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called the governor's office in Arizona today, and the recorded message said press one for English, press two for English, press three for English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new law is pretty strict. You can't use the slogan 'what can brown do for you?' anymore. Can't even use that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ironically, after they passed this new law, you know how they celebrated at the statehouse? Shots of tequila.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The top executive of Goldman Sachs testified before Congress today,&quot; which &quot;proves crooks always return to the scene of the crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So today you had lawyers, congressmen, and bankers in the same room. That's like the trifecta of lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the cover story of this week's 'Newsweek' magazine is about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and how President Obama sends her out to crack down on misbehaving world leaders. Gee, I wonder where she learned...to do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it was an announced today that President Bush's book will be released November 9th. The book will be called 'Decision Points.' It will be centered on 14 decisions President Bush made during his Presidency. See, this should silence the critics who claim Dick Cheney made all of the decisions. This book will prove&quot; Bush &quot;made at least 14 of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Arizona? ... They have that new tough immigration law, and they say now because they're getting a lot of reaction, they're saying it isn't targeted to Mexicans. The immigration law, they said, is not about keeping Mexicans south of the border. As a matter of fact, they had a crew out today a government agents looking for Dutch people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain supported Arizona's new immigration bill. John McCain, also an immigrant. ... He came over on the Mayflower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, this is good. Going to be ready for you in November. Going to be in bookstores in November. It's George W. Bush's memoir. ... It's about 14 key decisions that George W. Bush made in his life. ... For example, his decision to move Jay to 10:00 p.m.&quot; is &quot;covered in the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book will be ready in November. Bush is making last minute revisions right now. ... As a matter of fact, his computer screen is covered with whiteouts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the publisher says that the book contains quite a discussion about all of the mistakes that he made and all of the problems and all of the trouble that he caused. Boy, that will be a long book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And his wife, Laura Bush, also has written a book. They're going to be published at the same time. Both have memoirs. Her story and his story. I was thinking, well, whose book would you rather read? The one by the librarian or the one by the guy who choked on a pretzel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After meeting with his deficit commission today, President Obama said that it's a lot easier to spend a dollar than it is to save one. Even the deficit commission was like, 'Who invited grandpa?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona is very defensive about&quot; its &quot;new immigration law. ... They said, 'Wait a minute. This is just not about Mexicans.' ... So earlier today, they were out rounding up Swedes and Finns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, was on 'Oprah' today. ... She told Oprah she did not believe that she played a central role in the breakup of the Edwards' marriage. Really? So, getting pregnant by a married guy, having his kid, that's not what broke up the marriage? You know what broke it up? Fighting over the remote. ... I'm sure that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of that big oil rig fire down there in the Gulf of Mexico, it's now leaking oil into the gulf at a rate of 210,000 gallons of oil a day. ... That is the equivalent of 10 buckets of fried chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House's top budget director -- a man named Peter Orszag -- warned that out of control deficits will mortgage our future to foreign creditors.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the world renowned physicist, Stephen Hawking, you know that guy? He says in his documentary, aliens do exist, but he says it's best we do not try to interact with them. In fact, he's against giving them driver's licenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, Arizona has passed the strictest immigration law in the country and in response the mayor of San Francisco is pushing for a boycott of the state of Arizona. ... This could be devastating to gay rodeos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

An Austrian governor who speaks English with a German accent congratulating Spanish-speaking people before they drive their Japanese cars to work in a factory owned by the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Publishers announced...that former President George Bush's book will be released November 9th. The book is called 'Decision Points.' The title is based on the fact whenever a decision needed to be made, Bush would point to Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a show on CBS called 'The Mentalist.' ... It's about a...detective&quot; with &quot;heightened powers of observation. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George Bush is writing his memoir and his wife, Laura Bush...also writing a book called, I believe, 'From the Heart.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They sent specialists down there to start a controlled fire on the ocean to burn the oil off, which they say is helping. That's when you know things are bad, when the ocean on fire is an improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad an ecological disaster this is, today, the volcano in Iceland told BP Oil, 'You win. We can't compete. You guys are so much better at this polluting thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, a lot of people are now boycotting Arizona products. Here's how stupid it is.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Time' magazine has named Glenn Beck one of the hundred most influential people in the world. They also asked Sarah Palin, also a member of the top 100, to write an article praising Beck. So see that, two wrongs can make it on the right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Mahmoud 'I'm-a-nutjob'...is in New York City.&quot; He &quot;spoke at the UN today. He arrived in New York on Saturday night, he rented an SUV&quot; and parked &quot;it in Times Square.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know -- this is pretty serious -- somebody tried to detonate an SUV rigged with explosives in Times Square. SUV turned out&quot; to be &quot;a Nissan Pathfinder. Probably, the bombing suspect realized if he'd been driving a Toyota, he would have been putting his own life in danger.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say if this SUV bomb had gone off, it could have caused almost as much damage to New York City as Goldman Sachs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the oil from that oil rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico...spewing five times as much oil&quot; as &quot;first was estimated. ... When former President George w. Bush heard about this, he said, 'Wait a minute. You mean we have oil here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, British Petroleum said they're doing everything they can to control this leak. Really? Two hundred thousand gallons? That's a leak? ... The pipe under my bathroom. That's a leak, okay? ... This is a gusher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the environmental impact from this is unbelievable. They say a lot of birds are trying to leave the area. ... And, today, Arizona issued a warning -- any birds flying in from out of state will be stopped and arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arizona has passed the strictest immigration law in the country. It's scaring everybody. In fact, today, Taco Bell changed their name to Skippy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, announced he is quitting the Republican Party to run for the Senate as an independent. And today, it became official -- the Republicans took away his lesbian strip club VIP card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten British Petroleum Excuses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'The Gulf of Mexico was overdue for its 3,000-mile oil change.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'We promise we'll get around to it by Labor Day.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Relax, it's only leaking 210,000 gallons a day.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Giving everyone a free BP travel mug.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'Louisiana hasn't had a disaster in five years.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Guy from Goldman Sachs said it would make money.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Blame FEMA.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Did you hear Ricky Martin's gay?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Blame Toyota.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Honestly, we're so reckless -- surprised it took this long.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody from the Gulf of Mexico area? ... It's going to be the biggest ecological disaster on the history of the planet. And today, a tourist thought they saw a blowfish in the Gulf of Mexico. Turned out to be a flounder holding its breath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum says that they have a plan now to clean up the vast...oil spill. ... You know what it is? Hot tub time machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something very suspicious happened over the weekend.&quot; A &quot;car parked at, like, 45th and Broadway, very suspicious. ... And I'll tell you the most suspicious thing about the whole episode was that the guy found a parking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God the car bombing was thwarted by an alert carjacker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian dictator, Ahmadinejad, is in town. ... So for one day, Mayor Bloomberg is not the shortest dictator in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad...has got a busy schedule. Today it is the UN. And then tomorrow, he's going to be on 'The Rachael Ray Show', filleting a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, of course, down there in Washington DC, they had the big White House Correspondents' Dinner. Do you know who was really funny? President Obama. ... So funny in fact he has already been promised 'The Tonight Show' in five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, there were huge marches to protest Arizona's new immigration law. ... If you don't know, Arizona's new law says police have to ask anyone for immigration papers if reasonable suspicion can be found that they're in the country illegally. ... But what's reasonable suspicion? One Arizona lawmaker said, 'Illegal immigrants are easy to spot because of their clothes.' Really? I know it was obvious with me when I got off the plane because I was wearing Speedos, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you guys been following the whole oil disaster? ... Yesterday, President Obama said, 'Let me be clear. BP is responsible for this leak. BP will be paying the bill.' And BP was like, 'Ah, bailout? Right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of Arizona...is the subject of a lot of controversy because of this new immigration law they passed. There were big demonstrations all around the country yesterday protesting it. Many people believe it's potentially racist, but the state announced today that despite the controversy, they're still planning to move ahead with their annual Cinco de Mayo party. I guess it's sort of a going away thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if I was Latino, I don't...think I would go to this. ... 'Don't worry. Get on these buses. We'll take you to the party. It'll be a lot of fun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past Saturday, New York Police disarmed a car bomb in the middle of Times Square. .... Luckily, Mayor Michael Bloomberg rushed to the scene to fill in the public. 'At about 6:30...last night, an alert t-shirt vendor who is a Vietnam veteran noticed an unoccupied, suspicious vehicle. He alerted police officer Wayne Rhatigan of the NYPD Mounted Unit, who was on his horse, Miggs, patrolling Times Square.' I'm sorry. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! Uh, John Stewart, 'Daily Show.' What type of vendor and what war did he serve in? And...what was the name of the horse? And...do you have any information that matters?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the main thing to remember is that this tragedy was averted. The bomb did not detonate, but don't worry. The news media is going to make sure that the still at large bomber will get it right next time. 'It's well known that in trying to put together that kind of a bomb that you have to mix it with fuel oil.' 'He did not buy the ammonium nitrate, which could have caused a humongous explosion.' 'There apparently wasn't any kind of explosive detonator cap.' 'The valves on the propane tanks were not open, so the gas was not seeping out of the propane tanks.' Well thank you all very much for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, great news. They made an arrest today in that failed Times Square bombing attempt. ... It turns out the suspect is a foreign-born, naturalized American citizen. You know what that means? He would have been fine in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His name is Faisal Shahzad. ... What, is Snoop Dogg naming terrorists now? ... They're still looking for his brother, Fo Shizzle. They don't know where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the amazing part, they arrested this guy. He was already on the plane. It was taxiing down the runway. They called the plane back. And they're calling it great work by Homeland Security, and I guess it is. I mean, that's one way to look at it. I mean, how about the fact that a Pakistani guy who bought a one-way ticket to the Middle East, reeking of fertilizer, made it through security and got on the plane. How did that happen?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who's really happy they took him off the plane? The guy sitting next to him. ... Smelling manure for 14 hours?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, police raided this guy's house. I guess it's in Bridgeport, Connecticut. ... Some of the neighbors say the suspect told them he worked on Wall Street, so they were relieved to find out he was just a terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real hero in this story was the t-shirt vendor...who told the policeman about the smoke coming from the SUV in Times Square. And for some reason, New York Mayor Bloomberg took the policeman to dinner but not the t-shirt vendor. Hey, you see the t-shirt he's selling today?&quot; It says, &quot;'I saw the smoking SUV first, all I got was this lousy t-shirt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, this Faisal guy, not the brightest terrorist. Did you see his bomb? Three bottles of Diet Coke and some Mentos. You know, that's not going to do a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, it turns out this Faisal Shahzad&quot; has &quot;got a Facebook page. We looked it up. ... Let's see who his friends are. Look, bin Laden, Ahmadinejad...and Danny Bonaduce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are his favorite activities? ... What have we got there? We got beach volleyball, rollerblading. Look, blowing up Nissan Pathfinders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on at BP, which stands for, of course, big problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, British Petroleum promised to pay all necessary clean-up costs for this oil spill. ... And they said they will do it, no matter how much they have to raise gas prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of embarrassing. The government has called off the Safety Awards for Excellence ceremony that was supposed to take place this week, in honor of outstanding safety and pollution prevention. And British Petroleum, the one that was responsible for the big oil spill in the Gulf, was one of the three finalists for the award. ... I believe the other two were China and the volcano in Iceland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former aides to John Edwards are now claiming that Rielle Hunter lied to Oprah during her interview last week. Let me tell you something. You can lie in court in this country. You can lie at work. When you lie to Oprah; that is downright un-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Dumb Guy Ways To Fix The Oil Spill:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Have you tried club soda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Relax. BP says they got it under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Shhh. 'Dancing with the Stars' is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Swiffer that sumbitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Ask John McCain how they handled the Great Oil Spill of '23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Don't look at me. I voted for Kucinich!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If you got an extension cord, I got a Shop-Vac Wet N' Dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Oil spill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. I thought Iron Man was on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Invade Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This bombing plot here in Times Square is upsetting. ... Are we more upset about that than the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? Which do we hate worse? ... I think you've got to go with the oil spill. ... British petroleum, these boobs running this operation, they said, 'Okay, now wait a minute. It's just going to be a PR nightmare. What can we do? We'll give everybody a free tank of gas. ... All you have to do is drive your car right down next to...the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But BP plans to pay for the clean- up. Then they're going to ask for the bailout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say the oil spill has the potential to kill more wildlife than a Sarah Palin hunting trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it's British Petroleum, or BP. BP, of course, as in broken pipe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, they plucked a guy off a plane. His name is Faisel Shahzad. They say he was a moody loner. Last year, he vacationed in the tribal regions of Pakistan. Well, no red flags there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Bloomberg held a press conference. He described the bomb because everybody thought, wow, this is frightening. This is crazy. But the Mayor said, no, the bomb was crude and amateurish. ... That's what a lot of people are saying about last night's show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't you feel secure, ladies and gentlemen, knowing that the only thing standing between you and terrorism is a t-shirt vendor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts say the FBI is saying potentially this thing could have been the biggest bomb on Broadway since Peter Pan, starring Kirstie Alley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who was in town yesterday? Iranian dictator Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was here, and his Members Only jacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was speaking at the UN. Now, seriously, New York City is not this guy's kind of town. Everybody here is either gay or Jewish. He had to get out. He said, 'No thank you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Arizona? Yeah, you know, they have this immigration law in Arizona. I guess it's because they share a border with Mexico. In essence, the new law in Arizona is if you don't look like you belong there, get out. ... And if you're in this country illegally, I think I speak for most Americans when I say, '?Qu??'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're in Arizona and you don't look like you belong there, they'll give you a simple test. You have to be able to identify four of Larry King's ex-wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's rumored that six pages from the script of the 'Lost' series finale have leaked online. BP executives were like, 'Oh my God! That's definitely the worst leak of all time, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, scientists are predicting that the oil from the BP spill will eventually reach the shores of Florida. So if you hated visiting your grandparents before, wait until you're hosing down their oily bodies after a long day at the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, we caught a suspect in the failed Times Square attack. ... The suspect...says he acted alone. Yeah, really alone. Even his bomb wasn't in on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of terrorism, two new videos from the Pakistani Taliban seem to show that their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is alive, even though the US thought he was killed. So, either our intelligence is wrong or they're just shooting the new movie, 'Weekend at Hakimullah's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He could have been back home in Pakistan by now. Which is worse, by the way? Prison or Pakistan? Maybe the joke's on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, oil is still leaking off the coast of Louisiana. Lots of oil. BP, the company responsible for it, has a very good plan. BP is hoping to create a giant vinegar spill to turn the Gulf of Mexico into a delicious salad dressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, what they're doing is...spraying chemicals on the oil to try to disperse it. And some environmentalists say the chemicals pose their own dangers. But the company that makes them points out the active ingredient is the same thing they put in ice cream. BP is trying to get the spill reclassified from disaster to dessert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Police make an arrest in that failed bombing on Times Square, taking a Pakistani-born US citizen into custody.' ... The suspect is...Faisal Shahzad, which freaked me out because my doctor had just put me on Faisal, for my eczema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, they got the guy, and this was no ordinary arrest. 'Last night, last-second arrest of Faisal Shahzad, about to take off for Dubai.' ... 'A hair-raising thriller here to tell you about that began with a makeshift bomb and ended with a thwarted getaway.' Yeah! It's just like an action movie! It even has a black president!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you know about this? Tonight, to protest Arizona's new immigration law, the Phoenix Suns are all wearing jerseys that read 'Los Suns.' Thankfully, they can get the jerseys made quickly using an illegal sweatshop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the Phoenix Suns are wearing jerseys written in Spanish, made in China, modeled after their best player, Canadian Steve Nash. There you go. That is America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, we're starting to learn more and more about that man arrested in the New York SUV car bombing case. His name is...Faisal Shahzad. He's from Pakistan. What tipped off the authorities he might be the bomber? His name is Faisal Shahzad. He's from Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, looks like this guy was having financial problems as well. Turns out his house was in foreclosure. See, apparently the Taliban does not pay very well. ... And not to mention, no benefits. Who would take a job as a car bomber where they tell you, you have to use your own car? That's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about this. Here's what I came up with. Now, in Arizona, you know about the new immigration law, where if you don't look like you belong there, they can run you out of the state. And they've got...patrol cars driving around, pulling up to people, saying, 'You don't look like you belong here. Get out!' So the deal is, in Arizona, they don't like immigrants. And I was thinking, well, that's odd, because right across the river there in California, they elected one governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to protest Arizona's tough new immigration law, a lot of people now boycotting products made in that state. ... This could cripple the bolo tie industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that a good idea? Boycotting products made in Arizona? ... I can't find any products made in America. Forget Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is the Border Patrol has finally come up with a way to stop the illegal immigration. They're going to hire security guards from the Phillies game to just taser people as they come through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as a result of the Times Square bomber, there is a new policy regarding the no-fly list. They're actually going to start reading them now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this Faisal Shahzad...managed to get on the plane because the airline workers used an out of date do not fly list. ... But the good news? There is no way Lee Harvey Oswald was getting on that plane, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Times Square bomber? ... Now, I'm no genius, but this guy left his house keys in the bomb car. ... It was the one flaw in an otherwise perfect crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is some good news for Faisal Shahzad. Today he was told that he made the Taliban blooper real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just heard this about the Times Square bomber. ... The suspect...says he left a...getaway car near Times Square but was unable to use it on Saturday because he left the keys in the Pathfinder. That had to be a weird call to OnStar, right? 'Hello, OnStar. What is your emergency?' 'Oh, man, you are not going to believe this. So, I'm trying to blow up Times Square, right? I am in such a hurry to escape...I totally locked the keys in my car. It's just one of those days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news out of New York. The new Broadway play about Enron didn't get any major Tony nominations and will lose $4 million when it closes on Sunday. In other words, it was a major success compared to the real Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, it turns out the prime suspect in the failed attempt to bomb Times Square is not the brightest. ... They figured out the events leading up to Saturday. First,&quot; Faisal Shahzad &quot;buys an SUV off Craigslist, using a traceable email, and fills it with, basically, wedding sparklers. Then he drives two different cars into New York -- the one with the bomb in it and a getaway car. He plants the bomb but leaves the keys to the getaway car in the car with the bomb in it. So he has to take the subway home. And then, once he gets home, he realizes he also left the key to his apartment in the SUV with the bomb in it, and has to get his landlord to let him in. ... If this isn't the work of a stoner, I don't know what is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should probably let him out and go join the Taliban. He could destroy them from within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faisal Shahzad, aka, 'The Wannabomber,'&quot; is &quot;not just a terrorist. He's a moron. 'He drove another car to Times Square last Friday, the day before the attempted bombing, apparently to be his getaway car. But they say he left the getaway keys hanging in the rear hatch door of the bomb-carrying SUV.' 'He also left behind the keys to his home.' ... What are we going to do in this country when we get attacked by someone who is not one of the 'Home Alone' burglars?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a report circulating that this terrorist, this Faisal Shahzad guy that was caught at the airport, because the Army used sophisticated intelligence aircraft to hone in on his cell phone signal. They said a fighter plane scrambled found his signal and located him at the airport and tracked him down. ... I guess that's much easier than just looking for his name on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police searched the apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where this Shahzad guy was living. And they said he had no furniture, he slept on an air mattress, drank instant coffee and had a couple of free weights lying around. Terrorist? That's every divorced guy I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it seems like nothing has really been accomplished in the Gulf, and the situation gets worse every day, the government claims they've been involved since day one. Yeah. And they cite as proof of their involvement, nothing has really been accomplished and the situation has been getting worse every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crews attempted to lower a 100-ton concrete box, a huge box, four-story building a mile under the Gulf to stop the leak, putting concrete over the leak to stop it. This is not the first time dropping concrete in water to stop leaks has been used. I think the mob has been doing this for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the stock market fell again today after a huge drop yesterday. ... It's falling like Kate Gosselin after a tango lesson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stock prices are so low, Wall Street is starting to look like Wal-Mart street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so bad. Today, the head of Goldman Sachs made his assistant jump out the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, this crisis in Greece. This is unbelievable, this whole Greece is the word we're talking about. ... Well, it's being blamed on overspending, but government spending is needed to stimulate the economy, according to Greek president, Barack Obamopolous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A top investment analyst says that China's economy will slow down and crash within a year, which is pretty scary. I mean, where are we going to get all of our defective drywall and toys with lead in them for our children?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big lettuce recall in 25 states because of possible E. coli. They believe the problem might be traced to lettuce from Arizona. See? This is what happens when you let US citizens pick their own lettuce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about the new immigration laws in Arizona? What it is, if they don't like your looks, they can have you deported. I don't like how you look. You're out of here. But you new law is essentially buy a pinata, go to jail. That's exactly what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Arizona government is very defensive about this because people are saying that. They're saying you're just looking for the Mexicans who are over the border illegally. And the Arizona governor said, 'No, no, no. Earlier today we were rounding up Germans.' Which, by the way, is never a bad idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems like every week there's something new to be sick about, and this week, of course, it's the big British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Have you folks been looking at this thing? This is crazy. The thing collapses, and the safety valve, when it collapses, the safety valve is snapped off so the pipe coming out of the ocean floor-- I'm sorry, the Gulf floor-- is now pumping. It's leaking a little bit of oil-- 200,000 gallons a day. 200,000 gallons a day pumping right up into the Gulf of Mexico. It's affecting everything. I was at lunch on Sunday, and I ordered the sea bass. My hand to God it's a true story. The waiter said to me, 'Do you want regular or unleaded?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum the people that caused the big oil leak, they're saying they have the problem under control. What's that British Petroleum is saying, it's leaking -- I'm sorry, gushing -- I'm sorry, spewing -- 200,000 gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico of every day. British Petroleum says, 'You know what? We're taking care of this.' Well, that's good enough for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's speculation that yesterday's 1,000-point drop in the Dow may have been sparked by a typo. When someone entered billion instead of million on a trading order. Yeah. Economists are saying a single letter hasn't caused this many problems since the letter 'w.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a crazy week here in New York with the whole Times Square bombing. Federal authorities are now conducting an internal review to see if the suspect, Faisal Shahzad, was overlooked as potential terrorist threat. I'll save them some work. Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Faisal Shahzad, there are reports that he's been bragging about his connections to global terrorists. And the only thing more annoying than a terrorist is a name-dropper, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's some good news. The price of oil has dropped by $12 a barrel. I mean, why buy it when you can just scoop it out of the water, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, speaking of that. If anybody needs a 100-ton concrete containment dome, there's one on eBay for 75 bucks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know, that stupid idea about using a giant concrete dome and putting it over the leak, well, that didn't work. In fact, experts are calling this the worst use of a concrete dome since they built that stadium for the Detroit Lions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they're talking about trying to clog the leak up with garbage, like tires and golf balls. You know, where are the OxiClean people? Why don't we bring them down? Why not use the miracle cleaning power of oranges? Where are those people? Let's get the experts in here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP executives testified before Congress today. Did you watch any? Oh, my gosh. This is like BP meets BS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three companies involved in the oil spill are Transocean, BP and Halliburton. ... They're all blaming the other guy. I was stunned. Oil company executives passing the buck. It was just shocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress told BP they can't label this catastrophic failure as an unpredictable and unforeseeable occurrence. See, Congress used that excuse for not catching the financial meltdown, so now they have to come up with their own excuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece has a huge economic crisis. ... Tourism's down there. Government spending is up. And...Greece hasn't done anything in 2,000 years, really. I mean, other than that little to-go coffee cup in New York, there's not a lot they've made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greece is a relatively small country. It would be like a state over here. But it overspends, it over borrows, it promises expensive pension plans, it over-taxes, it over-regulates business. So, the state it would be here would be California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not looking good around the world, folks. ... A top investment analyst says China's economy will slow down and crash within the year. You know, they already have signs of trouble over there, too. Do you know the unemployment rate is a staggering 12% among 3-year-olds in China?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in announcing this Elena Kagan as his nominee for the Supreme Court, President Barack Obama characterized Kagan as a 'trailblazing leader.' The other Democrats said she was a wise choice because she had no paper trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in Colorado one of the gubernatorial...candidates has taken out a Craigslist ad to find a running mate. ... Is that a good idea? Hey, it didn't work when John McCain tried it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our transportation secretary, a man named Ray LaHood, announced that we are going to reopen the US border to Mexican trucks. ... Apparently they couldn't squeeze enough people into vans anymore, so they're going to trucks now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you about 'The Late Show.' It's like a car bomb and an oil spill all in one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the British Petroleum oil executives -- the guys responsible for the big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- they testified before Congress. This was great. They were criticized by the same guys who approved drilling in the Gulf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But these British Petroleum executives&quot; are &quot;trying to spin this a little bit. I heard one guy say today that it's a good thing actually because now when you open a clam, the hinge doesn't squeak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend, President Obama...gave an impassioned speech against technology. And then he had to stop when the teleprompter broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP, Transocean and Halliburton&quot; are &quot;blaming each other&quot; for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. They are &quot;all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP is going to try to stop the leak by pushing garbage into it. ... Oh, yeah, they haven't screwed up the Gulf enough, let's fill it with garbage, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest plan was to cover the leak with another concrete dome, a smaller one called a 'top hat.' ... Who came up with this idea, Mr. Moneybags, from the Monopoly game? What's next, the giant thimble?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Senate today voted to toughen standards for home loans. Under these new standards, lenders would have to verify the borrowers can repay the loan. ... Let's just hope China doesn't adopt this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. BP promised to never destroy the environment again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Half of the questions were about whether LeBron should come to the Knicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. BP chairman kept doing hilarious 'The oily bird catches the worm!' joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Out of habit, CEO from Toyota showed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Amazing how sleazy those lying bastards are. And the oil executives were worse! Now stay tuned for Jaywalking!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Everyone seems excited about Late Show's Close-Up Magic Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. We'll get Iron Man to fix it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that oil spill in the Gulf? ... They were going to put down what they called a 'containment platform'...and they were going to lower it into the Gulf. ... But that didn't work. So now, British Petroleum wants to try something else. It's a smaller containment device called the 'top hat.' ... They get the 'top hat' on the well, and then they're going to get John Wilkes Booth to shoot at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news from the world of publishing. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, has a new book coming out this fall. The warning came from an alert t-shirt vendor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Cairo have detained an American man who arrived on a flight from JFK with two handguns, 250 bullets, swords, daggers, and knives in his luggage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prison inmates in Louisiana are now pitching in to clean up the Gulf Coast oil spill. ... At this point, the solutions have been dump chemicals in the ocean, shoot a bunch of garbage under water, and release prisoners. If none of that works, they're going to have al Qaeda come take a look at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has a new book coming out called 'America by Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith and Flag.' Coincidentally, Faith and Flag are the names Palin picked out if she ever has twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Turns out he has no war record at all. In fact, only combat experience? Shooting himself in the foot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the truth is he got five deferments, like Dick Cheney. Then he used connections to get into a special reserve unit, like George Bush. And he would have been fine, if he hadn't lied like John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news today for Blumenthal. Because of all the trouble he's in for lying, he was offered a job as spokesman for British Petroleum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. On the news today, the CEO of British Petroleum says he believes the overall environmental impact of this oil spill will be very, very modest. Yeah. If you live in England!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP has inserted a siphon tube into the well to suck up all the oil from the spill. And they've had a lot of experience in this area, by the way. This is the same tube they've been using to suck the money out of our wallets for the past 50 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands of bees swarmed the White House Sunday morning. ... And President Obama...doesn't miss a trick. He is smart. Because all these bees were worker bees, he's now counted them as 10,000 new jobs he's created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in welcoming Mexico's President Felipe Calderon to the White House today, President Obama told him, 'We are not defined by our borders.' The president of Mexico said, 'What borders?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one embarrassing moment...with the Mexican president&quot; happened when &quot;Obama said, 'Let us all stand together,'&quot; and &quot;the governor of Arizona said, 'There he is. Grab him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain of Arizona&quot; is &quot;facing a tough reelection campaign. ... The key issue is illegal immigration. I don't want to say McCain is old, but in his first election, the illegal immigrants were white people, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another show canceled right here at CBS, 'The Ghost Whisperer.' ... Every week, the ghost whisperer would run errands for dead people. This week, you tune in, she's trying to find a job for Arlen Specter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? An Indiana congressman, Mark Souder, was forced to resign because of a sex scandal. Oh, buddy. Here's the score now -- Republicans 22, Democrats 17. It's getting closer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, he appeared in court yesterday, his first court appearance here in New York. He was escorted into court by two Federal t-shirt vendors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big state dinner at the White House last night in honor of Mexican President Felipe Calderon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Connecticut, Attorney General Dick Blumenthal's campaign is now saying there are only four times that Blumenthal said he served in Vietnam when he really didn't. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blumenthal said he is not apologizing for misleading people about his war record. He said all he did was use the word 'in' instead of the word 'during.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a very embarrassing moment&quot; for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, &quot;who was running for the Senate.

And she said, 'Hey, how about Vietnam?' Awkward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of Greece's impending bankruptcy, many countries in Europe are demanding that Greece change their laws that allow workers to retire as early as age 50. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Calderone also lashed out against Arizona's new immigration law. To give you an idea of how serious he is, he is calling for Mexicans to boycott sneaking into this country until that law is repealed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a White House report, President Obama becoming more and more frustrated by this whole oil leak thing. He lost his temper today. He reportedly yelled at people, 'Plug the damn hole!' ... That's the same thing he says whenever Joe Biden starts talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced yesterday he plans to send 1,200 troops to the US/Mexican border. You know who we should hire to protect our border? It's so simple. Mexicans. They want jobs, they're there already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, here's the latest update. I guess this is good news. ... BP officials say the 'top kill' plan is working. The bad news -- BP officials are a bunch of lying weasels.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum is still trying to minimize the PR damage. ... You know what they said today? They said all the oil that spilled this month is on the house. No charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama looked pretty mad, if you watched his press conference today. President Obama said the head the Federal agency...in charge of regulating the oil company is no longer there, but he didn't know if she resigned or if she was fired. Didn't know if she resigned or was fired. I got a better idea. How about arrested? ... Let's try that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study shows that fathers can suffer a form of postpartum depression after their child is born, especially if they're John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that 43% of Americans think President Obama is doing a good job at handling the BP oil spill. Of course, the same poll found that 43% of Americans hate pelicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today at a press conference, Obama said that the government does not have better technology than BP. That's a nice thing to announce to the world, that our government has fewer resources than a company that tried to plug a hole with a 'top hat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Obama fired the head of the Mineral Management Services, because of lack of oversight of offshore oil rigs. It's got to be tough finding another job after that. It's like, 'I see you were head of the department in charge of preventing oil spills? .... And this was during the huge oil spill?' &quot;Yeah, that's right.' 'You may not be Wendy's material.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Gulf oil spill now officially the worst in the US history. In fact, they're calling this the biggest environmental disaster since the state of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we're right in the middle of a process called 'top kill.' Doesn't it sound like some bad Steven Seagal movie from the '80s?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP says if 'top kill' fails, they'll try something called the 'junk shot.' Hey, worked last night for the Lakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a big new scandal going on. Have you heard about this? Republicans are now saying that President Obama had Bill Clinton offer a job to Pennsylvania's Joe Sestak in exchange for dropping out of the Pennsylvania Senate race against Arlen Specter. It's kind of complicated. But if it's true, it's an impeachable offense. That's what they're saying. They're comparing it to the Clinton impeachment. Close, but no cigar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a rough day in the stock market. ... It's so bad, today, President Obama had to lay off two teleprompters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Joe Biden had to cash in his swear jar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama called the Gulf Coast oil spill 'an assault on our shores.' ... And then he said the same thing about fat dudes in Speedos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a crazy story. An American adventurist strapped himself to a bunch of helium balloons and floated from England to France. Immediately afterwards, people in Mexico asked, 'Exactly how many balloons?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is...now clear that BP's latest idea to solve the oil leak by waiting for Aquaman to talk dolphins into stuffing themselves into it may not work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, they've tried a couple different ways to fix this damn thing. There was the 'top hat' idea, where they were going to put a dome over the whole thing. That didn't work. Then there was the 'junk shot', where they tried to fill the pipe with mud and golf balls and trash. And that didn't work, although on the plus side, we did fill the Gulf of Mexico with mud, golf balls and trash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But fear not, America, the President of the United States of America is on the case! 'I'm not going to rest or be satisfied until the leak is stopped.' ... He will be on this thing 24 hours a day, right after celebrating the great Connecticut Huskies women's basketball national championship. ... 'Anybody here majored in oil leaks? Anybody? Anybody?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, the President has said that his top priority is the oil spill. He said that in May 2010. You know, he made a very similar pronouncement in May 2009 for another pressing issue. 'Healthcare reform is a key priority to this Presidency. That's why I will not rest until the dream of healthcare reform is finally achieved in the United States of America.' And, ten months later, we had it. So the oil should stop flowing, in March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or, to put that in terms the President understands, NCAA basketball tournament time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Occupational Safety and Health Administration records showed that in the last three years, BP ran up 760 egregious, willful safety violations at their US refineries.' Impressive, but amazing? Well, we really won't know until we compare it to something. 'This dwarfed violations from other oil companies. ... Exxon had one.' One! Exxon had one! The people who think nothing of putting tigers into people's tanks. They had one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does BP explain such a horrendous safety record? 'Much of that record relates to a prior period, and our absolute focus the last three or four years has been on safe and reliable operations.' No, no, no! The record did not relate to a prior period. It related to the three or four years that you just said it was your priority. ... Well, I guess that explains BP's old slogan: 'Raping The Earth &amp; Fomenting Civil Unrest In The Middle East Since 1909.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, like millions of Americans, for the last two weeks, I've had my...eyeballs glued to an exciting new television drama. It's the hit summer series, 'Grainy Footage of Leaking Underwater Oil Pipe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the twists and turns have been non-stop. First, BP tried the 'top hat.' Then they tried 'top kill.' Next, they're going to try 'top chef,' where they plug the hole with Tom Colicchio's giant, bald head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm a serious pipe head, but there is one thing I haven't figured out about this series ? who's the villain? I mean, it can't be BP. ... 'We're taking full responsibility for it. We're not blaming anyone yet.' They're not blaming anyone yet. They won't jump to conclusions before all the facts, data, and one-way tickets to Paraguay come in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, all the fan sites have their own ideas about who the villain is. I like this theory. 'The President and his people are in charge of this under the Oil Spill Liability Act, and they don't have a plan.' 'For more than a week, the White House appeared to pay little attention to this event.' 'And we don't have one ounce of action from the President.' Yes! Obama. He wanted it to leak, because that would prove what he said in March when he allowed off-shore drilling. 'It turns out, by the way, that oil rigs today generally don't cause spills.' Clearly, they don't cause spills. They cause unstoppable gushers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I'm sure we've got plenty of time to figure...out&quot; who the villain is &quot;because it looks like 'Grainy Footage of Leaking Underwater Oil Pipe' has been renewed indefinitely. I just hope they don't jump the shark. Are there any sharks left? No. Oh, good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For months now, I've been warning you that President Obama is ending America's manned space program. Soon, the only way for Americans to launch themselves into space will be to row out into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and toss a lit match overboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now...we really, really need to save the program because my lifelong dream was to be an astronaut, and soon, I will fly to Houston for space training. I've already started it at home. To get used to weightlessness, I have let my muscles atrophy for 46 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, all of that hard training may go to waste, because there are only two space shuttle missions left. Just last week, Atlantis returned from its final planned mission, where astronaut Steven Bowen, during a seven-hour space walk, bravely untangled a space shuttle cable. Because otherwise, they would have had to wait for the Comcast guy between the hours of noon and 2050.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, don't get me wrong. ... I understand why they needed to retire Atlantis. That thing was built back in 1985. It's got 120 million miles on it, and the wiper blades are shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Middle East and the Korean Peninsula -- two great tastes that threaten to annihilate us altogether. 'Hey! You got religious strife in my ethnic tension!' 'You got ethnic tension in my religious strife!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, Israeli commandoes raided a flotilla of ships in international waters that were attempting to carry 10,000 tons of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in violation of an Israeli blockade.&quot; This led to an &quot;Israeli assault&quot; that killed &quot;at least nine activists. ... Israelis said the activists attacked them first with clubs. The activists said they never attacked the soldiers, they thought Israel was welcoming them with commando shaped pi?atas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As to why Israel had elite Navy SEALs repelling on to the deck of what looks like P. Diddy's St. Bart's vacation yacht, Israel says they had to search the boats to see if there were any materials that could be used to build explosives and supply tunnels. So what nefarious accoutrement of terror did they find? ... 'Here are some hospital beds and here are some wheelchairs.' I knew it. Hamas has been working on a crutch-a-pult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, the crutch-a-pult, perhaps the most humane weapon to be hit with. It fires crutches, so even if it hurts you, you have...something to help you get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So this story is apparently...very complex. ... I wonder how the world will react to the incident. ... Flag burnings, violent protests. Or, as it's known in that part of the world: Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;James Cameron has been called in to help BP stop the oil spill. Soon, they'll be failing in 3-D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BP oil spill keeps gushing. Nobody knows how to stop it and everybody is out of ideas. Now, two fools to the rescue. James Cameron and Kevin Costner are getting involved. One made 'Titanic' and the other made 'Waterworld', so they both know about disasters at sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're even asking ordinary citizens to submit ideas.&quot; That &quot;is like your open heart surgeon asking you for advice while he's operating on you. 'Do you usually bleed this much?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sir Paul McCartney played at the White House last night. He dedicated the Beatles song 'Michelle' to the First Lady. Isn't that lovely? And then for Joe Biden, he played 'Fool on the Hill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Underwater robots have successfully cut through the pipe on top of the blown out BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico.' ... The next step...is to lower a dome -- well, another dome -- over the pipe. Although, unlike the first two failed domes, this dome is heated, to either prevent ice crystal buildup or to appease the leak by building it nicer and nicer places to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, if the heated dome doesn't work, maybe we're just going to give it a three bedroom house, wood floors, granite kitchen ? the works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, a simple plan for fixing the problem in the Gulf of Mexico. Just rename it the Black Sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, we have all been horrified by this oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but I am happy today to report there was finally some good news from BP. ... 'A more risky attempt to plug that gushing well in the Gulf of Mexico recovers from a major snag. Workers free a saw that got stuck while cutting the damaged pipe.' They got their saw back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I was worried, because it was a really nice saw. It had diamonds on it. They chose it for the occasion because, like a diamond, this oil spill is forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And getting that saw blade free allowed BP to cut through the undersea pipe, which means more good news. 'Twenty percent more likely oil is spewing than was before because they've opened up the hole bigger.' It's all part of BP's new strategy ? draining the Earth as fast as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts are estimating that the oil could continue leaking through Christmas, which means there's a good chance the hot holiday toy this year is going to be the Clean-It-Yourself Egret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to tell you, in the face of this tragedy, I'm beginning to wonder just how committed the Obama Administration really is to fixing this mess because they are dismissing the one bold solution that we know would work. 'As for the so-called 'nuclear option,' literally, that's making the rounds on the Web, detonating some sort of nuclear device near the oil well shaft, the Pentagon tells us no consideration, serious, that is, being given to that idea at all.' 'They say the nuclear option has never been on the table.' Never on the table? The nuclear option is always on the table. Of course, we'll never use it, but it acts as a deterrent against that oil spill. And we already know it has chemical and biological weapons, because it is them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, nuking oil wells is proven technology. The Russians have used nukes to stop leaks like this five times already. Though to be fair, they also use nukes when they get locked out of their house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you...can believe it, folks, an Administration official actually said the nuke plan, quote, 'It's crazy.' Yeah. Crazy awesome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, it's not guaranteed to work, and sure, no one knows how the radiation would spread or affect wildlife, and sure, it would violate international treaties, but come on. It would turn the bottom of the ocean to glass. How cool is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if we nuked the seafloor and turned it to glass, we wouldn't have to do any more exploratory drilling. We could just see where the oil is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Push the button, President Obama. This is no time to wave the white flag. For one thing, with all that oil, it's not going to stay white for very long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, consumer confidence is way down, but I have a solution -- poor-quality merchandise. Think of the boost to the economy if instead of buying one good coffee maker every five years, you're buying five crappy coffee makers every one year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, of course, there are unpatriotic souls who value quality over quantity, people who reject the cries of, 'Buy American!', and instead cry, 'Don't buy that! It will set fire to your drapes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like the nervous Nellies over at 'Consumer Reports' magazine. I ask you, if they know so much about what consumers want, why are they still a magazine?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're saying now that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could go until August. Six months leaking oil. Just like your old Chevy Nova in the driveway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to get the oil spill fixed and we need to put a cap on it, but BP is not making it easy.&quot; The CEO of &quot;British Petroleum...said, 'There's no one that wants this thing over more than I do.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to BP, this containment cap is now capturing, they're capturing 10,000 barrels of oil a day. Which is amazing, considering they said it was only leaking 1,000 barrels a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP officials are now saying the campaign to clean it up could last until fall. That's why they call it a campaign. You know why it's called a campaign? Because it's like an election. It's dirty, it's slimy, it never seems to end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP -- they are spending $50 million on an advertisement budget to try and put a pr spin on this whole thing. Like, you hear what they said today? This is unbelievable. They said fishermen down there are catching tuna that are getting 35 miles per gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC just announced who's going to be the next contestant on 'The Bachelor.' Surprisingly, Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh got married for the fourth time on Saturday. He's 59, she's 33. So, I'm doing the math. That means when she's 40, he'll be on wife number seven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House reporter Helen Thomas &quot;is retiring after making some quite controversial comments about Israel. She said Jews should leave the Middle East and go back to where they came from. The problem is that's where they came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that language programs in US schools are lagging behind. Not enough kids are learning foreign languages in America.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They nabbed a couple of terrorists right here at JFK. And these guys have been training to become terrorists.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea now the level, the quality of training that the terrorists are getting: These two guys trained every weekend to become terrorists by playing paint ball. If they got really good at paint ball, Al Qaeda would let them plant a bomb in a go-cart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore and his wife, long time married couple, are separating. Tipper Gore. And they may get a divorce. Apparently what happened, they experienced global cooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oil spill is getting bad. There is so much oil and tar now in the Gulf of Mexico, Cubans can now walk to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here now the official Rush Limbaugh wedding announcement. ... Rush Limbaugh wed Catherine Rogers in a quiet Florida ceremony on Saturday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rush Limbaugh &quot;got married over the weekend. ... This is actually his fourth marriage; he blames the first three breakups on Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama spoke at Kalamazoo's central high school graduation ceremony in Michigan. He told the students they could be anything they want to be, but if they could be oil leak experts, that could be great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP's CEO Tony Hayward said yesterday that he will not step down over the gulf oil coast spill. Yeah, he said, 'I mean, it's not like I let one of the biggest ecological disasters in history happen. Oh, I did? ... Well, at least my first attempt at cleaning it up worked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he's not stepping down, Tony Hayward is handing over responsibility to the cleanup to an American named Bob Dudley. There's a name that gives me confidence. ... It sounds like a sitcom character who's always messing everything up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just announced that President Obama is going to visit India this November in response to Prime Minister Singh's invitation. So, mostly, he's going over there to visit our jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were off last week, but, you know, I got no relaxation all last week. I spent the whole week helping Al Gore move into the Oakwood Apartments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore and his wife getting divorced? After 40 years of marriage, it's kind of sad. Apparently what happened was, I guess, she walked in, caught him boring another woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are signs the divorce is starting to get ugly. In fact, today, Tipper stopped recycling and bought a Humvee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's a great father, he's terrific with the kids. He'd always read to the kids at night to help them fall asleep. Well, he would just start reciting one of his speeches, and the kids just ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing to me, the new unemployment figures are not good. A lot of people out of work, yet somehow the CEO of British Petroleum still manages to keep his job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on NBC, president Obama said today he would've fired BP CEO Tony Hayward if he worked for him. But unfortunately, as you know, the White House works for BP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Tony Haywire guy, whatever his name is, he told the BBC on Sunday that he believes the new oil cap that they've installed will eventually capture the vast majority of oil spewing from the well. You know, if they could capture half the BS spewing from Tony Hayward, people would be thrilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BP CE Tony Hayward &quot;said he would just like to get his life back. He wants to get his life back. You know, I say give him life plus 20.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only commercial airline in Iraq, Iraqi Airways, folded this week. The CEO of Iraqi Airlines said the company could not survive in a market where everybody in the country is on the no-fly list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is fed up with the gulf oil leak. He says now he's getting tough. He wants to know, which, quote which asses to kick. 'Whose ass do I kick?' Dick Cheney said, ass-kick them? Well, just water board them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who performed at the Rush Limbaugh wedding? Elton John. Isn't that amazing. It proves that there's absolutely no ideological gap that a million dollar check can't bridge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2005 Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010 the Gulf was devastated by the largest off- shore oil spill in US history but the fun is just beginning. The governors of the Gulf coast states are pleased to announce they are now accepting bids for the next disaster to hit the region in 2015. Will be a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, an avalanche, killer bees, a meteor, piranhas, zombies or high frequency sound waves?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A great day for President Obama. He addressed a group of senior citizens in Maryland today. He's pitching his healthcare bill. According to a poll, half the seniors thought the President was convincing. 30% thought he was unconvincing. And the rest thought he was Will Smith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, the Obama's invited members of congress to a picnic at the White House. Yeah. They played all the classic picnic games -- Wiffle ball, capture the flag and their favorite game, ignore the oil spill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama's picnic featured foods from all over the four corners of the US, the Pacific Northwest provided the wild salmon and strawberries and the Southern Gulf Coast provided 400 million gallons of salad dressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today marked the 50th day of the BP oil spill. Yeah, the oil spill is getting so old, its tar balls are starting to sag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the 'today' show this morning, President Obama said that he talks to oil experts so that he knows whose ass to kick. As opposed to the last president who talked to oil experts so that he knew whose ass to kiss.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP is now saying they've captured anywhere from 35% to 75% of the oil that is gushing out of the well. Of course, you've got to keep in mind they usually lie anywhere from 85% to 95% of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women won big in California, Arkansas, Nevada and South Carolina. These are exciting times. I can remember when only rich white men could buy elections. Now women can buy them, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, the big winner was Meg Whitman,&quot; who &quot;got rich selling crap on eBay. And you know, she might be the right one for the job, because the way the state is going, we may have to sell California on eBbay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one time, Barack Obama lived in New York City. ... Obama hasn't lived in this apartment here in New York City since 1981, but oddly enough, it's still where he picks up his Pottery Barn catalogues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1934 the first Donald Duck cartoon premiered. ... He's 76 years old. ... You'd think if America loved a 76-year-old...guy with a hot temper so much, we would've elected John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few days ago, Vice President Biden and Rahm Emanuel had a water gun fight during a party at Biden's house. ... Meanwhile, Sasha and Malia spent the last few days trying to solve the BP oil crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little bit of good news. The Coast Guard says that Bp is now catching up to 630,000 gallons of oil a day. The bad news is that they're capturing it with ducks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of the biggest races were in California, where both the Senate and the governor's mansion are up for grabs. There, former Hewlett-Packard CEO... Carly Fiorina will get the chance to square off against Barbara Boxer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'You know, career politicians in Sacramento and Washington, DC, be warned, because you now face your worst nightmare. ... Two business women from the real world...who know how to create jobs, balance budgets and get things done.' Yes! Of course, she's referring to the business savvy of Carly Fiorina, named as one of Portfolio magazine's 20 worst CEOs of all time, and who, in only six years, was able to reduce Hewlett-Packard stock value by, oh, I don't know, a third.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or perhaps she was tooting her own fiscal bona fides. 'Meg Whitman has contributed $71 million from her own fortune.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, apparently, Hall and Oates were worried Arizona authorities would make them go back to where they came from -- the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, British Petroleum stock...dropped $17 billion in value. ... And the executives at British Petroleum say they have no idea what happened. I kind of have an idea. I kind of think maybe I got a hunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the good news. Actor Kevin Costner was testifying before Congress earlier today. And he has come up with a way to separate oil from seawater. And so he was telling the congressmen all about it. And previously, Kevin Costner developed a process to separate moviegoers from their money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But British Petroleum, they're getting desperate, so here is what they are going to do to improve their public image. With every 100,000 gallons of oil that leaks, you get a free NFL team glass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys heard about Al Gore and Tipper splitting up? Everybody is talking about it. Everyone's blogging about this, and now there are reports online that his daughter and her husband are splitting up. ... I bet this is the one week where Al Gore wishes he didn't invent the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the economy appears to be on track to continue to expand through this year and next. And then he said, 'And you can take that to one of the remaining banks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This afternoon, President Obama met with Bill Gates at the White House to discuss energy reform. It was very cool. Bill Gates offered to plug the Gulf Coast oil leak with 5 billion unsold Zunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain actually tweeted to Snooki&quot; from &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, an MTV program, &quot;after she complained about the tanning bed tax in the new healthcare law. But, unfortunately, Snooki never got the message because McCain tweeted it off his electric razor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news still out of the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; British Petroleum is &quot;deploying state-of-the-art technology to stem the flow of bad information. 'The company is actually buying up search terms on Google and Yahoo to try to get out in front of story on the Web.' ... Yes, apparently, BP's greatest cleanup efforts are aimed at preventing fact balls from washing up on the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A review of British Petroleum's 582-page plan...to deal with a catastrophic oil spill&quot; was &quot;found to be full of errors and severely flawed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are upset and wondering why President Obama is willing to sit down and talk to the Iranian President Ahmadinejad and not to BP chief Tony Hayward. I guess Obama is meeting with Tony Hayward next week. I think President Obama was a little afraid of Hayward. Think about it. Ahmadinejad only threatened to destroy the world.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're talking about this...bomber. ... And it turns out now that the reason he was so inept is because he failed to complete the al Qaeda training school.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the al Qaeda training school. That was&quot; the bomber's &quot;fallback school when he didn't get into Ball State.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you been following what's been going on in the South Carolina Democratic primary for the Senate? This is very bizarre. A man named Alvin Greene has won the Democratic primary.&quot; But he &quot;didn't go to any campaign events, spent no money, gave no speeches, was kicked out of the Army, he's unemployed, he lives with his mother, and he's facing felony charges for showing lewd photos to students. I know. Sounds like a senator to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico. ... And you know, the oil slick is going everywhere. So the next time somebody lands on the Hudson, it won't be that big a deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is now in the Gulf of Mexico. This is his fourth visit since the spill. So the President has been down there four times. And the head of British Petroleum is saying, 'Well see, it hasn't affected tourism.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that BP is moving up its timeline for containing the oil by two weeks. ... They said they'd...get it 'done, even if they have to work six hours a day, four days a week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, on Saturday, President Obama had a 30-minute phone call with the British Prime Minister David Cameron about the BP oil spill. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? In Afghanistan, the US has discovered large deposits of iron, copper, cobalt, gold, and lithium. ... Or, as most people would call it, 'not Osama bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Obama said today he's going to use the Gulf disaster to immediately push a new energy bill through Congress. I got an idea. How about first using the Gulf disaster to fix the Gulf disaster?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the heads of the five families -- we call them 'oil companies' -- testified before Congress today. It was billed as 'the tarballs versus the slimeballs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, during the testimony, the President of BP said the underwater cleanup is pretty effective. And when he was done, Congress gave him a standing ovation. Well, sure, they've never seen anybody who could lie better than they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's an amazing story. A 52-year-old construction worker -- a guy from right here in California -- was arrested in Pakistan today, armed with a pistol and a 40-inch sword.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it seems the United States has found over $1 trillion of untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan. And here's the great part. The country comes pre-invaded. ... We don't have to invade again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And besides the deposits of iron, copper, cobalt, and gold, they found the largest deposit of lithium ever discovered; most of it on land controlled by tribal communities. Wait a minute. Wasn't that the plot of 'Avatar'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in the Gulf region again today,&quot; having &quot;lunch at a local seafood restaurant. Horrible timing. A clam coughed up a tarball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry the show is on later than usual. It was delayed by the President's speech about the Gulf oil spill. Obama has been criticized for not doing enough.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know it's a real catastrophe when our biggest hope is Kevin Costner. I'm not kidding. Costner spent millions of his own money to develop a water-cleaning system&quot; that &quot;soaks up...oil-tainted water and spins it around and pumps out pure water at the other end. ... Director James Cameron is also helping out. He offered up his fleet of private submarines. ... If he's serious about cleaning up the spill, why doesn't he soak it up with his 'Avatar' money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While he was in Mississippi yesterday, President Obama ate mini crab cakes, fried shrimp and shrimp salad sandwiches to show Americans that seafood from the Gulf Coast is safe to eat. And if you don't believe Obama ate all that stuff, just ask our new president, Joe Biden. ... He'll tell you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also ordered a lemon-lime snow cone on the beach. A little awkward. Obama was like, 'Forget the oil spill for a minute. Can we figure out how to fix the leaks in the bottom of these paper cone things?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the oil spill, yesterday, BP ordered 32 oil-separating machines designed by Kevin Costner. ... Costner said, all along, a voice kept telling him, 'If you build it and there's a huge oil spill and the oil company and government have absolutely no idea whatsoever how to clean it up, they will come.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, earlier tonight, President Barack Obama unveiled his plans for the Gulf of Mexico and America's future energy needs.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little riddle for you. What's covered in heroin and sitting on a pile of gold? No, not Amy Winehouse. Well, not just Amy Winehouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the answer? Afghanistan! ... 'Reports now of potential newfound wealth for Afghanistan, a previously unknown yet massive amount of mineral deposits.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Barack Obama spoke from the Oval Office about his plan to clean up the oil spill. Did you folks get a chance to see it? Yeah. Well, I'm glad that problem's behind us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made a lot of promises that he can't possibly keep. I mean, it's like he's campaigning again, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He assured the nation that the Gulf will be cleaned up and restored to even greater beauty and prosperity. Well, you know what that means. He's started drinking. That's the only possible explanation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, right after the President's speech, Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, said that we should not demonize the oil companies. ... Well, I'm glad somebody's looking out for the little guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then today, the President met with...British Petroleum&quot; CEO Tony Hayward, and Obama was &quot;demanding that British Petroleum clean...up the Gulf. And I'm thinking, good luck. They can't even clean up their gas station restrooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said we need a new energy strategy, one with more alternatives, like solar power. I agree. But let's not forget about lunar power. Remember, the moon is what gives power to werewolves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I know Obama was trying to take the long view, but talking about solar energy in the middle of the oil&quot; spill is &quot;like watching your house engulfed in flames and saying, 'We really should change the curtains.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By this point, it's not even an 'oil spill' anymore. Spill is a little accident that can easily be cleaned up. Calling this a 'spill' is like calling World War II a 'tiff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's not the only one on the hot seat right now. The CEO of BP is taking a lot of flak. His name is Tony Hayward. ... Today, President Obama had a meeting with Hayward at the White House. It got off to the wrong start. Hayward arrived in a Hummer limo powered by baby seals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder how Obama began that meeting. 'Thanks for wrecking my Presidency, Tony. Want a water or something?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hayward... didn't take any questions after his White House meeting today. Probably a good thing. He's great at destroying ecosystems, but not so great at talking. Hayward&quot; has &quot;said...'No one wants this thing over more than I do. I'd like my life back.' ... Tony, I'm so sorry you had your summer disrupted. I'd buy you a drink, but you'd probably spill that too. And make me clean it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, listen. I'm not naive about large faceless corporations who destroy everything that's beautiful. I work here at CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that Hillary Clinton is now more popular than President Obama. Hillary was like, 'Look, I don't pay attention to the silly polls like that -- what were the numbers exactly?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right, Hillary is more popular than Barack. ... They're separated by about ten points, or roughly one billion gallons of crude oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP had to stop collecting oil for a few hours yesterday after a bolt of lightning struck its ship in the Gulf, causing a fire. When asked for a comment, a spokesman for BP was like, 'So that's how things could possibly get any worse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama finally met with BP's CEO Tony Hayward, but the meeting was only scheduled 20 minutes. Call me crazy, but I think it should take more time to discuss an oil spill than it does to get your oil checked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys, 'Top Chef DC' premieres tonight on Bravo. I love that show. But since it's in DC, the contestants don't actually cook, they just talk about what they're going to cook in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, President Obama announced that British Petroleum will set aside $20 billion to pay the victims of the oil spill in the Gulf. Well, that is good news. The bad news -- it still comes out to less than, like, a dollar a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These British Petroleum guys...can't do anything right. The chairman of BP, Carl-Henric Svanberg, told reporters that sometimes large oil companies are greedy and don't care, but 'not...BP. We care about the small people.' That's what he called the residents of the Gulf ? 'the small people.' But to be fair, English is not the guy's first language. Money is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the problem is I do believe they care about the small people. Problem is, they don't care about the big leak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the...CEO of BS -- is it BS? BP. I'm sorry. It's BP. I'm sorry. I don't know where I got BS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Hayward. You read about this guy? He's a little weasel guy. ... Well, he was testifying before -- why do they even call it testifying? Testi-lying, that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the sad part is, environmentalists say if this leak continues unabated, some species might become endangered, like Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the other oil companies are turning on BP. While testifying in Washington this week, Exxon executives blamed the Gulf oil spill on lapses by BP. See, that's when you know things are bad, when Exxon is lecturing you on oil safety, huh? That's like Heidi Montag saying, 'Just be yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen President Obama lately? People are saying he's dying his hair. Right there, that's a good use for the oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new bill in the Senate that is upsetting a lot of people. This bill would give the President the power to shut off the Internet. ... Al Gore is strongly opposed to it. Not because he invented the Internet. Because he did. But because he just signed up for Match.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday during a press conference, BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg caused some controversy when he said BP cares about the 'small people.' Part of his new strategy -- plug the hole by digging himself into a deeper one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP said that the comment was lost in transition from Svanberg's native Swedish to English. And the Americans were like, 'We get it. We've all tried to assemble something from IKEA. Apology accepted.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Washington, BP CEO Tony Hayward told members of Congress that his company is working to make sure that a spill like this does not happen again. And they have a great plan in place. They're going out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story ? it's day 59 of the siege on the Gulf,&quot; when &quot;Congress had its chance to take out its pent-up anger on...BP CEO Tony Hayward. But of course, before they did that, the CEOs from Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Conoco Phillips, and Chevron took to Capitol Hill to answer the questions, 'Gosh, would you guys have done this?' ... And the good news is, those oil companies do have contingency plans in the unlikely event of a spill. ... 'Several of the plans include an emergency contact for a Dr. Peter Lutz,'&quot; who &quot;'has been dead for five years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, oil guys, talk yourself out of this one. 'The fact that Dr. Lutz died in 2005 does not mean his work and the importance of his work died with him.' Right. But it does mean you can't call him anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with BP CEO Tony Hayward, otherwise known as 'the lying king.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, Hayward told Congress yesterday he's 'deeply sorry'...about the Gulf oil spill. He said he would have apologized sooner, but he was putting 100% of his energy trying to turn off that underwater video camera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a story that just stunned people. Texas Republican Congressman Joe Barton actually apologized to BP yesterday...for the way he felt they have been treated. ... Finally, somebody with the political courage to say what's on all our minds, huh? Yeah. Let's give BP a break. Boy, they've been through a lot. Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how stupid are you when you have the CEO of BP in the room and people think you're the moron?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair, it's not easy for a lot of these congressmen&quot; to &quot;bite the hand that bribes you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, Cuba is bracing for effects of the leak, though a lot of Cubans say they can't wait for the oil to get there. They're hoping to use it as a Slip 'n Slide to sneak into Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, yesterday was the 38th anniversary of the Watergate break-in,&quot; when &quot;Republicans broke into Democratic headquarters, looking for their long-term plans and strategies. It...marked the last time anyone thought the Democrats had a plan worth stealing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors now that the CEO of British Petroleum is saying they could go out of business. ... And I thought, well, yeah, great. But if they go out of business, who will be in charge of not stopping the leak?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that NASA says there's 100 times more water on the moon than they first thought? In fact, there is so much water on the moon that BP is planning to go up there...and ruin it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I'm not going to do any jokes about oil spill related news. I thought it might be nice to just pretend for a few minutes that the oil spill isn't happening. You know, kind of like BP does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While testifying before Congress, BP's CEO Tony Hayward called the oil spill a 'complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures.' Then he realized he was reading notes left on the stand by a Goldman Sachs executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was on the Fox Business Network and surprised a lot of people by calling marijuana quote, 'a minimal problem in America.' She said law enforcement has more important priorities than arresting people smoking pot in their homes and also admitted that she herself has tried pot, which...could explain some of the things that she's said over the years. It's not Sarah, it's old baked Alaska talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was shocked that a woman who named her children Willow, Piper, and Trig and married a snowmobiler would be pro-marijuana. ... You would never expect that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I guess that's why...John McCain picked her. She was his hookup.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know something, as if these poor people in the Gulf weren't angry enough, you see what&quot; BP CEO Tony Hayward &quot;did over the weekend? He flew back to England to race one...of his yachts in the pristine, crystal clear waters off the coast of England. His yacht is named BOB, B-O-B, which stands for 'British Oil Bastard,' I believe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Hayward on a yacht. Where are the Somali pirates when you need them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, oh, when he heard this, oh, he was furious. President Obama got so mad, he almost couldn't finish his round of golf. That's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, I tell you, I think it's hurting him. President Obama is losing support from his own party over the way he's handling this BP situation. You want to know how bad it is, today, Jimmy Carter compared him to Jimmy Carter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has revealed she has tried marijuana, but she did not like it. You know, it's amazing: 200 million Americans have smoked marijuana. The only ones who don't like it seem to be elected officials. Ever notice that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bet that's what John McCain was smoking when he picked her. It all makes sense now. Of course!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and how stupid is this. You know, this state is so broke, they're just trying to make money any way they can. California lawmakers -- this is real -- are now considering a bill to allow electronic license plate frames on vehicles that will flash digital commercials. ... Who is this for?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways Tony Hayward Can Improve His Image:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Catch Osama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Contaminate waters around a country like North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Reveal secret behind his soft and lustrous curly hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Apologize on The Golf Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Shoot new BP commercial where he viciously is pecked by angry pelicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Join team Coco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Get a job at Poland Spring; accidentally dump a billion gallons of water into the Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Improve his image, are you kidding? He's doing great!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Hang out at BP station, let customers inflate his a*s with air hose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Dial it back from 'arrogant bastard' to 'smug pr***'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are kind of upset with British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward. ... Over the weekend, he was out on his yacht. And when President Obama found out that...Tony Hayward was on his yacht, he was so angry, he missed a putt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his defense, Tony twittered...that the oil spill was still his top priority. And I think you know that a guy really cares when he tweets from his yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad? He was in court today. And here is where the guy screwed up. He didn't count on our army of alert t-shirt vendors. ... And I was thinking, well, it's too bad we didn't have them in the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faisal now faces a couple of charges, including attempted terrorism and conspiracy to double park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the whole oil mess has been going on, President Obama spent the weekend playing golf with Vice President Biden. ... Biden's handicap is 16 and Obama's handicap is Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also went to the White Sox-Nationals game this weekend and actually sang 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game.' ... However, critics were quick to point out that while his singing sounded good, it seemed like he really didn't say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while Obama was playing golf, BP CEO Tony Hayward actually spent his weekend at a ritzy yacht race, where he watched...his 52-foot yacht compete. ... If that's not bad enough, he was watching is it from his 100-foot yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's rumored that President Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, will leave the White House at the end of the year. He says the work is important to him, but he wants to spend more time screaming at his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently minted mortal Barack Obama got BP to put $20 billion in an escrow account to pay back all those impacted by the disaster. Good news, for almost everybody. 'The President and I disagree on this escrow fund.' 'There's a misreading of the Constitution and a misunderstanding of jurisdictional limits from this White House. Now it seems that it's all about extortion.' Yeah, you broke it, you bought it is not extortion, just like give a penny, take a penny is not stealing, or philanthropy. You know what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman is pushing a bill to give the President absolute power over the Internet in the event of a national security emergency. Under the legislation, the President would have a figurative kill switch to seize control of the Internet and shut it down.' Either Joe Lieberman is exceptionally worried about cyberterrorism or somebody has a sex tape he doesn't want the world to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds a little silly, but Lieberman maintains it's necessary in the event that our communications structure comes under attack. And he's got, I think, a really good argument for it. 'Right now, China, the government, can disconnect parts of its internet in the case of war. We need to have that here, too.' Oh, see, I was worried about the potential government overreach and government censorship, but if China says it's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I have been a huge fan of the World Cup ever since I heard the US might win a game.&quot; But on &quot;Friday, we were fighting back from a 2-0 deficit to tie Slovenia when&quot; a &quot;goal was disallowed&quot; by a referee &quot;from Mali. ... This call was totally unfair, and the rest of the world agrees. 'It was a real injustice.' 'It was bad refereeing.' ... The US hasn't felt this much global goodwill since 9/11, and folks, we cannot let it go to waste. It is time to invade somebody. How about Mali?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I am pretty sure that there is a Nobel Prize in my future because I have discovered an inexhaustible source of renewable energy: My rage at BP. ... This Saturday...BP CEO Tony Hayward took time out from his busy schedule of making turtles extinct to attend a yacht race in England. No wonder he wanted his life back, because it looks pretty sweet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, everybody hates Tony, which is bad news for Texas Congressman Joe Barton, because last Thursday he said this to Hayward. 'I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown. I apologize.' Then, to secure his popularity, Barton punched an orphan with a boxing glove made of kittens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, what Barton said shocked the nation. Even Republicans like John Boehner backed away so fast, you'd think Barton had said it in Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Barton then apologized for his apology. 'I want the record to be absolutely clear that I think BP is responsible for this accident. If anything I've said this morning has been misconstrued in opposite effect, I want to apologize for that misconstrued misconstruction.' Coincidentally, Misconstrued Misconstruction is also the name of the company that BP hired to build the well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is clearly a shakedown, folks. No oil company would ever voluntarily do the right thing. This $20 billion escrow account is a violation of cashtitutional rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He was talking about the Administration. He was trashing...everybody. ... So President Obama...calls the guy home from Afghanistan, and they had, like, a...sit-down in the White House, in the Oval Office, today. It was very, very intimate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Obama sacked Afghanistan commander Stanley McChrystal over biting comments the general made about the President and his team to 'Rolling Stone' magazine.

Same Roto Rooter van has been parked across the street for the last six years. 3. Always asking if you have change for 500 rubles. 2. Saw him with blueprints for the secret candy and soda powered rocket car. 1. You walk in on him giving your wife the old hammer and sickle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something great. Russian spy ring here in New York City. ... They were busted in New York City. Once again, they were spotted by an alert t-shirt vendor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Russian spies tried to blend in. They were acting like Americans. As a matter of fact, for two weeks, they were pretending they loved soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Vice President Dick Cheney? ... He's had like six or seven heart attacks. The poor guy was in the hospital over the weekend. He has been in the hospital so many times the gift shop is now selling Dick Cheney bobble head dolls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...how about the Gulf of Mexico? ... Billions and billions of barrels of crude oil just surging into the Gulf of Mexico. It's like we essentially have paved the Gulf of Mexico. Cubans are now walking to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there's a tropical storm in that area and it may interfere with the clean-up of the Gulf. Too bad, because it was going pretty well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big hit on the Internet is the spill cam. ... It's so popular that they're thinking about adding a band.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, in the Gulf region, demonstrators are holding hands on the beach by way of protest. ...Boy, that will show 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Forbes' magazine&quot; published &quot;their most powerful celebrities list. Number one was Oprah Winfrey. ... I'm...happy to be on the list, a little farther down. I'm between Flo, the Progressive Insurance lady, and the Salahis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't your heart break for Sandra Bullock? ... She and Jesse James officially divorced. You know who she's dating? Gary, the Osama bin Laden hunter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary&quot; was &quot;over there in Pakistan and had night vision goggles. ... He had a sword. And he couldn't find Osama bin Laden. That means he's actually tied with Bush and Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden arrived in the Gulf today to survey the oil spill. I'm like, haven't these poor people suffered enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's day 71 of the oil spill...in the Gulf of Mexico. They just did a poll that says only 6% of Americans have a favorable view of BP, to which I say, 6% of Americans have a favorable view of BP? That's 18 million people. Is it possible that 18 million Americans don't know what the word favorable means?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP is running with this, I guess. ... Their company newsletter&quot; has &quot;an article that says most Gulf residents aren't upset with BP because their clean-up crews have boosted the local economy. ... BP taking credit for boosting the economy in the Gulf is like al Qaeda taking credit for creating jobs in airport security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I remember correctly, it's been a little while since we've heard from Vice President Joe Biden. I assume that's no accident. Here's the lengths the Administration is going to keep him under wraps. This week, they sent him to Milwaukee. ... His big diplomatic mission? Buying frozen custard. Even Biden can't blow this one. 'Where's the ice cream?! 'It's custard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gaffe. Did you hear that? He called frozen custard ice cream. I can't believe he's a heartbeat away from the presidency. Oh well, I guess it's back to the undisclosed location for ? wait. There's more? ... Play the rest of the clip. 'What do we owe you?' ... 'Lower our taxes and we'll call it even.' 'Why don't you say something nice instead of being a smart a#@ all the time?' ... You know, I've got to say, as Biden gaffes go, it ain't no tellin' a guy in a wheelchair to stand up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real issue here is why Biden even bothered to the answer. You're the Vice President. This guy's workin' at a custard shop. I know it's tempting to want to shoot back at him. But, did you ever think maybe that's why your handlers had you holding a custard in your hand in the first place? The perfect item to perhaps shove in your pie hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was day two of Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. And I don't know about you, but I could barely stay awake. It's like watching senators dry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has given President Obama the power to turn off the Internet for four months. ... You ever been around the house with your kids? ... If the Internet's down, they wig out. They're like crackheads.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Larry King Is Retiring: &quot;10. He's 126 years old. 9. High definition format scared children and the elderly. 8. Didn't mean to retire. He forgot he still had a show. 7. Wants to focus on his second career as a barn owl. (Editor's note: Split screen image of Larry King and a barn owl were shown by the program.) 6. It's not easy juggling a television show, marriage, and an affair with your wife's sister. 5. Suspender rash. 4. Lately, introduces every guest as the 'lovely Ms. Carol Channing.' 3. Couldn't handle pressure of coming up with questions like, 'What's your favorite lunch meat?' 2. Well, there's this. (Editor's note: Program showed videotape of Larry King stuttering, trying to say 'E. coli.') 1. He needs time to plan his divorce.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, news from the world of broadcasting. Larry King has announced his retirement. ... He says he wants to spend more time with his wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, seriously, Larry has really been trying to slow down, of course, since his recent death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry's absence creates a void. As a matter of fact, his presence creates a void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how savvy the Russian spies are and were -- they knew four years ago that Ricky Martin was gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're having the confirmation hearings down in Washington, DC, with Elena Kagan. And so far, the woman has offered very few opinions. I thought to myself, well, my God -- how do you find a woman like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP execs are saying today that Hurricane Alex has rendered their oil containment plans useless. In other words, nothing has changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Larry King announced he's calling it quits. ... Larry's not only a broadcasting legend, he's also a good guy. ... He's given millions of dollars to charity. Charity's the name of an 80-year-old stripper from Brooklyn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the third day&quot; of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Elena Kagan. There is &quot;no job in this country more important than Supreme Court justice. And they're appointed for life, so you need to be thorough about vetting who you pick. You don't want to wind up with David Hasselhoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...all across the country, it was iPhone mania. Thousands and thousands of people lined up for the new iPhone. Meanwhile, out in Arizona, John McCain was on line for a pay phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously we've had a lot to cover this week. The G-20, World Cup, Joe Biden declaring war on frozen custard and all who serve it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But a major story has been unfolding in Washington all week -- the confirmation hearings for President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. ... For three days, Solicitor General Elena Kagan has sat for questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Supreme Court's version of a gang beat-in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously the war in Iraq, war in Afghanistan still raging, the oil spill ravaging our shores, and now it seems we're facing an even more insidious enemy. 'Ten people are in custody this morning, accused of spying for Russia from the suburbs of the Northeast, in a throwback to the days of the Cold War.' The Cold War! First the 'A-Team', then the 'Karate Kid' movies are back, and now this. We really do love the '80s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, as you know, no secret, terror is everywhere. From the underwear bomber to the Times Square plot, America's enemies never sleep, which is surprising because they watch a lot of soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now,&quot; al Qaeda &quot;has developed its most diabolical weapon yet. 'First up, Al Qaeda May hate all things American, but the terror cell is now putting out its first English language magazine. It's called 'Inspire.&quot; ... It's the day we've all feared. Al Qaeda has acquired magazine technology. And we all know how powerful the magazine industry is right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;July the 4th is when we celebrate the Declaration of Independence. America actually declared independence from Britain on July 2nd, but the wording wasn't agreed upon until July 4th. If you skipped work July 2nd, got drunk,&quot; and &quot;shot fireworks at innocent bystanders, you've actually done nothing wrong. Try that with the judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With comments regarding Afghanistan,&quot; Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele &quot;may have finally gone too far. 'That's the one thing you don't do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan. This was a war of Obama's choosing. This is not...something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in.' Okay. Forget about the fact that we've been in Afghanistan since before Obama was even a gleam in the Senate's eye. Forget about the fact that this non-act of war has cost the United States thousands of casualties, and just focus on this. This is the head of the Republican Party going against one of his party's core principles -- blowing sh%# up in other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like Jews for Jesus. It's like Democrats for competence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not the only one who is not feeling well. Last week, evidently, the Labor Department reported that we lost another 125,000 jobs. And I'm pretty sure the guy who created that report was then fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the East Coast is suffering from just a terrible heat wave. ... In fact, on Wall Street, stockbrokers were jumping out of windows just for the cool breeze on the way down.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday, of course, the Fourth of July, recognized our independence from the British. Back in 1776, Americans were fighting to escape British rule. Of course, today, we're fighting to escape British oil. So...the struggle continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say traces of BP's oil has started turning up in disturbing places, like congressmen's pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was talk the Democrats are going to try and pass an immigration bill this year, but it looks like that's not going to happen. It's kind of ironic. The only place that has an immigration plan is Mexico, and their plan is to immigrate here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new unemployment numbers are here! 'The government said the unemployment rate dropped...but the economy, still losing jobs, 125,000 in June.' ... Imagine if we hadn't had the stimulus. 'It's hard to argue...things would have been a lot worse. ... People kind of say, 'Yeah but unemployment's still at 9.6.' 'Yes, but it's not 12 or 13 or 15.' Yes. I believe we can all agree as Americans, there are many numbers bigger than nine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at least the unemployed still have their benefits, which will help them keep their heads barely above water. 'The House passed a bill to extend unemployment benefits, but the Senate...failed by a single vote, then went home for a long Fourth of July recess.' ... Extending benefits to jobless people seems like such a no brainer. What possible argument could you make against it? ... 'Continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work.' You hear that, people who have lost their jobs and are skating by on your $1200 a month? The gravy train is over! Well, not so much gravy as the ketchup packet soup train is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm looking at you, nearly a million people who no longer count in the unemployment statistics because you stopped filing or looking for a job due to despair and/or lack of shoes/no electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, in a special one-hour show on ESPN, LeBron James addressed the nation. And a lot of people got confused. In fact, when Glenn Beck saw it, he called LeBron a Muslim and demanded to see his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lindsay Lohan's former assistant is reportedly being offered five figures by various magazines to do a tell-all interview about her boss. But so far, she's refused to do it because she said it would affect her career. So apparently, Lindsay Lohan's assistant has more sense than General McChrystal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news is we have Vice President Joe Biden on the show tonight. ... Joe Biden is different from Dick Cheney. See, in the Bush years, the President would say things and then the Vice President would have a heart attack. See, when Joe, the Vice President, says things, the President goes, 'Ah! What?!' It's a whole different thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, those 10 Russian spies that were arrested have now been sent to Russia in exchange for four of our spies. It was a 10 for 4 trade. ... We tried to make it 12 for four, but they wouldn't take Heidi and Spencer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum said this week in a 'perfect world' they could stop their leaking oil well by the end of the month. But you know what? A perfect world wouldn't have a company like British Petroleum, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh had an apartment here in New York City. He sold the apartment for $11.5 million. ... That is $2.5 million for the apartment and $9 million for what they found in the medicine cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was a huge apartment -- 4,000 square feet of space.... No, wait a minute, that's Rush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rush Limbaugh just sold his penthouse in New York for $11 million. The apartment is amazing. ... It has a 24-hour doorman and a 24-hour pharmacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before they capped it, BP had to test the integrity of the well...which I believe is the first time BP and integrity have ever been used in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BBC is reporting that Venezuela may have massive oil reserves, more than even Saudi Arabia. You know what that means? We could have invaded closer to home and saved gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to be fair...to President Bush, at the time we invaded Iraq, he thought Venezuela was a planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston revealed exclusively to 'Us Weekly,' my bible, that they are getting married. Sarah Palin allegedly not happy about this, because she feels they barely know each other and they are making a big commitment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today that the stimulus package saved three million jobs. But they said there's still more jobs that need to be saved: President Obama's; Joe Biden's; Harry Reid's; Nancy Pelosi's...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is certainly good news. For the first time since April, oil has stopped gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. ... I'm not sure what engineers they used to fix this. I think we can rule out the guys who created the new iPhone 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the good news -- BP has successfully capped the well. The bad news -- they used a screw-on cap, in case they want to spill more later,&quot; and &quot;kind of manipulate the price a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked why they finally stopped it now, a spokesman for British Petroleum said, 'Well, we had to stop it, you know, before it got to England.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bristol Palin, Levi Johnston are getting married. ... There's a rumor going around that Sarah Palin may try and prevent the wedding. ... Do not underestimate this woman. She stopped John McCain from taking the oath of office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story is Bristol and Levi will be getting their own reality show. I think it's going to be called, 'No, We Won't Just Go Away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced this week that the stimulus package saved three million jobs. ... The package was $862 billion, which means it cost us $287,000 per job. You know what we should have done? Write a check to those three million people for $187,000 each. They could have stayed home for the summer and we would have saved $300 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the President of the European Commission said that cooperation between the US and European countries have fallen short. ... And today, Roman Polanski said, 'Yeah, it's great, isn't it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you know the very first atomic bomb was tested on this day in 1945 in New Mexico? It was top secret. ... So apparently, it was a lot easier to keep a secret back then. I mean, how do you keep an atomic bomb explosion a secret? I mean, Mel Gibson can't even keep his phone conversations secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York appeals court has just overturned the FCC's right to regulate the amount of obscene language on broadcast television. So finally, some good news for Mel Gibson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, BP May now face a seven-year off-shore drilling ban. ... In response, BP said, 'What are we supposed to do for seven years, sit there like idiots and do nothing all day? We can do that. We can do that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what stinks. FEMA still hasn't arrived there at the scene of the earthquake. And they're there! ... That's where they are and they haven't arrived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The earthquake woke everybody up at 5:00 a.m. Hillary Clinton ignored it and rolled back to sleep. She just thought it was Bill coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a study by the Brookings Institute, Washington, DC, has the highest concentration of smart people in the United States. Let's see. We have a mess in the Gulf, we have a dysfunctional home security; we are $13 trillion in debt. Imagine how bad it would be if these people weren't geniuses.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is in Islamabad, Pakistan, today. Here's the odd part. You know what she's doing there? She's scouting locations for Chelsea's wedding. I was stunned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The countdown is...under way for what a lot of people are calling the wedding of the year: July 31st, Chelsea Clinton's getting married. Bill and Hillary...say they don't care who the groom is, as long as it's not Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has passed a new policy now that will protect the nation's oceans and coasts. Thank God, because you just don't want anything bad to happen. Honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Sarah Palin, who was the governor of Alaska for a couple of years? ... She had a daughter who had a baby out of wedlock with a guy named Levi Johnston. ... And this is good news -- they're getting married. ... Bristol and Levi are getting married. You know who they were talking to today? Joe the wedding planner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who will run for president? Jeb Bush. ... I feel the same way about Bush presidencies as I do about the 'Godfather' films. You're better off stopping at two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is speaking out, finally. She is opposing a plan to build a mosque...near the site of the World Trade Center. ... I don't know. You put a mosque there, there's no way the terrorists blow it up. If I was in charge, I'd put a mosque on top of every building in America, just to be safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin tweeted this on Sunday. She said, 'Ground Zero Mosque supporters: doesn't it stab you in the heart, as it does ours throughout the heartland?' Is Alaska part of the heartland? 'Peaceful Muslims, pls refudiate.' Now, I don't think refudiate is a word. And it wasn't a typo either, because she's used that word before. 'The President and his wife, the First Lady, spoke at NAACP so recently, they have power in their words. They could refudiate what it is that this group is saying.' She's like the Eskimo Don king. She makes up words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good news in the Gulf of Mexico for a change. The efforts to stop the oil leak seem to be working. ... The cap they're using is child proof, so it is never coming off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newspaper circulation has fallen to a new low. Newspapers, they say, are becoming obsolete. ... I think it's true. To give you an idea of how bad it is, today I saw a guy sleeping on a park bench with an iPad on his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is a story that doesn't seem to want to go away. According to the 'National Enquirer', police have investigated complaints from massage therapists that they were abused by Al Gore. One said she was threatened.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all remember Vice President Dick Cheney. ... He has to have a warning bracelet to let people know there's&quot; heart &quot;trouble. What about a warning for his hunting buddy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who will probably run for president now? President Bush's younger brother, Jeb. ... There are three Bush brothers. George W. Bush. You have Jeb. And of course, the hot-tempered Sonny.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what happened to Sarah Palin. She was delivering a speech and she was so excited and she said 'refudiate.' ... You have refute and repudiate. And she combined them. ... I remember a couple of years ago, John McCain mistakenly combined the words vice president and Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich did not testify at his corruption trial yesterday. Here's an ironic part. He wanted to testify. Turns out, he sold the seat he was supposed to testify in for $100,000.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to former Senator Bob Dole: 175 years old today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you seen this new reality show, 'White House Apprentice'? It's kind of like the other 'Apprentice' but when the boss says, 'You're fired,' he offers you your job back a day later,&quot; after realizing &quot;he made a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this Shirley Sherrod? ... This poor woman fired from the Department of Agriculture for allegedly making racist comments in a speech. Well, if you listen to the entire speech, you realize she was telling a story and the first part of the story, she talked about it. Then the second part of the story, she talked about overcoming racism. That was the whole story. She just didn't finish, to which Mel Gibson said, 'That's what my tapes are like. You have to listen to the whole thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jeb Bush,&quot; the &quot;brother of former President George Bush...is running for president. ... Thank God, ladies and gentlemen! The comedy recession is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political experts and pundits and people who know the Bushs are saying that Jeb Bush is smarter than his brother. That's damning with faint praise, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama and his family are going on vacation in the Gulf Coast next month. ... Of course, the Gulf Coast is a lovely place to sit back and relax. Just ask BP.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comic book fans are gathering in San Diego&quot; for Comic-Con.

Speaking of guys who will beat you up for your lunch money, Governor Schwarzenegger spoke...yesterday&quot; in &quot;front of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which sounds like a fun group. And the Governor kept things light with a topical and hilarious joke. 'The good news is that BP has contained the oil leak. ... The bad news is that no one has figured out how to contain Mel Gibson.' He's still got it, I'll tell you that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the comedy didn't stop there. The Governator also cracked wise on one of his favorite subjects, which is the importance of a daily workout. ... 'Just last week, I lifted 375 pounds. ... I lifted Rush Limbaugh out of the chair.' ... Right, because he's fat and you lifted him, out of 'the' chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel charged with multiple ethics violations. And of course, most members of Congress were stunned. They had no idea there was more than one ethic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even know what to make of this. There's a report that Kate Gosselin and Sarah Palin are taking their families camping together in Alaska. It must be true because Sarah Palin hasn't refutiated it yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A woman from Washington is suing American Airlines for $5 million after they lost her luggage. When the airline said, 'That's a ridiculous amount of money for luggage,' she was like, 'Now you know how we feel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apple says that it's delaying the release of the white iPhone 4 because they are more difficult to manufacture than expected. Really?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A website called WikiLeaks has posted 90,000 classified military documents about the war in Afghanistan. It's a huge deal. And the Pentagon is outraged.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an internal investigation launched by BP themselves -- well, they determined that British Petroleum is not at fault for the giant oil leak. BP has cleared BP. So, I guess we all owe them a huge apology, huh? &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story in Washington is this leak of over 90,000 government documents on the war in Afghanistan, which experts say could prove 'highly embarrassing to the government.' ... You know what that means -- Joe Biden moves down a notch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's interesting. Although the CIA. claims they have no idea where Osama bin Laden is, these documents seem to reveal he was spotted several times...the last couple years. And here's the weird part -- you know where he was seen? Lady Gaga concert. ... I was stunned by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum has announced that as a result of their own internal investigation, it has cleared itself of all blame in the Gulf oil spill. ... And, in a related story, Congressman Charlie Rangel announced he will investigate himself, and, after waiting an appropriate amount of time, will find himself completely innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an American by the name of Bob Dudley is the new head of BP, replacing Tony Hayward. Nice to see an American taking a job from a foreigner for a change, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In The Leaked Government Documents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Revealed secret recipe for Ayman al-Zawahiri's 'Easy Cheesy, Potato Casserole.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Intelligence agencies have almost deciphered the plot of 'Inception.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Outlined the Knicks' failed strategy to get LeBron.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Al Qaeda canceled plans to destroy Gulf of Mexico when BP beat them to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Haven't found Osama's cave, but did find his 'man cave' with a sweet 65-inch flat screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Despite stern memo from Kathy Mavrikakis, documents weren't printed double-sided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Discovered classified location of Chelsea Clinton's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Obama and Osama almost appeared with Oprah in Tostitos Super Bowl commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Turns out the nine-year, no-end-in-sight Afghan war isn't going well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way -- it happened earlier today just before I came out -- 90,000 pages of the Clinton wedding plans were leaked by WikiLeakia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward...got fired. ... British Petroleum is sending him to a project in Siberia. He wants to go to a part of the planet that hasn't yet been ruined. He wants to go there and see if he can't ruin it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who is going to be on 'The View' on Thursday? President Obama will be on 'The View.' ... I predict after 10 minutes on 'The View,' he'll call General Petraeus to send in more troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...on 'The View,' I mean, my God. First the Nobel Prize and now this. Wow!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP announced that CEO Tony Hayward will...be replaced by American Bob Dudley. ... I bet Bob had a mixed reaction when he heard that. They're like, 'Bob, we're making you CEO.' 'Yes!' 'Of BP.' 'Damn it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is going on a 10-day vacation to Martha's Vineyard in August. Obama was like, 'This is my longest vacation ever.' And voters were like, 'Wait 'til you see the one we're planning for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice performed a duet with Aretha Franklin at a charity event tonight. Not to be outdone, President Bush played tambourine on three songs with The Wiggles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP announced today...they will replace Tony Hayward as CEO. ... They are offering him a spot running their operation in Siberia. For real. You think they even have an operation in Siberia? Maybe they are just planning to leave him out there on an ice floe or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin with explosive news. 'Secrets are out about the war in Afghanistan.' ... So, top secret? 'We just came from an off camera session with...a Pentagon spokesman. He says it looks to be secret in nature, not top secret.' Oh, just secret. I was worried. I thought it was top secret. That's a much lower classification. It goes secret, top secret, and I believe, of course, pop secret. That is where all of our military information is encoded in fluffy and delicious butter coated kernels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was absolutely thrilled to hear that while I was on vacation, BP finally capped the Gulf oil spill. ... That is a cause for celebration. But if you're in the Gulf, please, no fireworks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is even more big news about BP. ... 'Fox News has confirmed BP CEO Tony Hayward will step down.' That's right. Tony Hayward has been resigned. He's looking forward to spending more time saying insensitive things to his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the oil spill has ended. So there's nothing to worry about, except, the Wiki spill. 'WikiLeaks is publishing what it says is more than 90,000 US military reports filed about the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2009: Raw data from the front line, a day-by-day unvarnished view of the war by US soldiers themselves.' This is outrageous! First body armor, now we're not supplying our soldiers with varnish. Come on! Come on, Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama will appear on 'The View'&quot; tomorrow, thus &quot;becoming the first sitting president ever to be on a daytime talk show. He's going to talk to the ladies about the economy. Then later on, he will go on 'General Hospital' and explain to the doctors how the new healthcare system works. Finally, he'll end up doing a makeover on Tyra Banks. So it's going to be a big day...for the President.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona's new immigration law...has given birth to a new state slogan: 'What happens in Arizona stays in Mexico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, actually,&quot; a Federal &quot;judge issued an order blocking the most controversial part of the new immigration law from going into effect tomorrow. Police will not be asking undocumented workers for their papers. So, in a related story, Wal-Mart today said the job fair will continue as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just hours before it was supposed to take effect,&quot; the &quot;law was blocked by US District Judge Susan Bolton, which means she either thinks the law is unconstitutional, or she hasn't been able to find another nanny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is the interesting part. A hundred protesters gathered in front of the US Embassy in Mexico to wait for the judge's decision. And guards wouldn't let allow them on the grounds because the embassy is considered US land. Kind of ironic, isn't it? The only US land people from Mexico aren't allowed in is in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Embattled Congressman Charlie Rangel is said to be working out a deal with the House Ethics Committee. See, only in Congress can you work out a deal with the Ethics Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continental Airlines announced today a new feature called self-boarding. There's no ticket agent taking your boarding pass anymore.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! ... Sounds like illegal immigrants are here, and you can stay in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, because of this new law, a lot of illegals have fled the state and gone back to their homeland, Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, today, the same day this new anti-immigration law went into effect, Arizona made it legal to carry a concealed weapon without any training or a permit. So, if you're illegal&quot; and &quot;working the night shift at the Phoenix Wal-Mart to support your family, get the hell out of there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was a guest on 'The View' today. ... Then later in the afternoon,&quot; he &quot;went over to 'The Maury Povich Show.' He passed the lie detector test. Turns out he was born in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said he had a good time on 'The View.' He said surprisingly, the ladies there talk a lot less than Joe Biden, so it wasn't so bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were some surprise questions. Joy Behar asked the President about Snooki...from 'Jersey Shore.' Well, President Obama said he didn't know who she was, which is okay, because Snooki doesn't know who he is either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, according to those leaked Pentagon documents -- listen to this -- Pakistan once plotted to kill an American diplomat with poison beer. I didn't even know they sold Pabst Blue Ribbon over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, despite the CIA claims that they cannot find Osama bin Laden, these WikiLeak documents say he was seen several times in the last couple years, and according to one report, he was seen attending monthly meetings in Pakistan. Here&quot; the weird part. They were Amway meetings. ... He was trying to get a distributorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea Clinton's getting married this weekend. And Bill said, 'I'm going to try not to cry when walking her down the aisle.' Actually, the last time Clinton cried at a wedding&quot; was &quot;his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Too busy with his daily routine: Gym, tan, laundry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Huckabee already has a lock on the 'pasty fat guy' vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Leaves voicemail messages that make Mel Gibson sound like a choir boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Scared of Lincoln's ghost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Wants to be 'American Idol' judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Wasn't blessed with Bush family stammer (Editor's note: Program played video tape of Bush stammering, 'Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme.')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For some reason, he'd rather not inherit two wars, massive debt and an ocean full of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. No governor siblings to help him rig the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we have&quot; anybody from Arizona &quot;here? ... This new immigration law went into effect...I believe earlier today. And it may not mean much to us but I mean I'm telling you, the Diamondbacks had to replace their entire bullpen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they're serious. Today, out there in Arizona, they swapped 10 illegal aliens for four Russian spies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama went on 'The View' yesterday and got something he hasn't had in years -- high ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama says his new message to the American people is things could be a lot worse. Well, that's inspiring, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several hundred demonstrators opposed to Arizona's new immigration law marched to Phoenix's courthouse yesterday. And on the way there, they picked up a couple hundred more at the Home Depot parking lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the people were protesting this new law, SB-1070. They want to replace it with bill WD-40. This allows illegals to slip in and out of the state whenever they want, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Charlie Rangel has reportedly struck a deal with the congressional ethics panel. You know what that means. Time to start investigating the ethics panel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Rangel has been accused of 13 ethics violations. But see, politicians. His explanation was...he may have just been overzealous in serving the public. Remember the last time a politician was overzealous helping you? ... Maybe overzealous lying to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chelsea's wedding is this weekend. ... Doesn't that sound like the ultimate chick flick? Didn't Julia Roberts marry Hugh Grant in that one? 'Chelsea's Wedding.' Sounds like it should be on the double bill with 'The Notebook.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the rumor is Chelsea will be wearing Hillary's old wedding dress. Now, Bill said today he doesn't remember Hillary's dress. He remembers what the maid of honor was wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The seating plan at a wedding like this is very tricky. ... For example, you don't mix political adversaries. Like, you can't put CNN reporters...next to Fox News reporters. And whatever you do, don't put Al Gore near any massage therapists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This story doesn't seem to want to go away. It seems Portland police reportedly interrogated Al Gore last Thursday, about allegations that he sexually abused a massage therapist back in 2006. And of course, being Al Gore, the light they shined in his face when they interrogated him...was a low wattage, long life, energy efficient bulb. They wanted to be extra green.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A New Mexico man is okay after setting fire to his wooden leg with his crack pipe. ... That's when you know you're smoking too much crack, okay. When the pipe gets so hot, your leg catches fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;RadarOnline is reporting that Bristol Palin may call off her wedding to Levi Johnston after she found out his ex-girlfriend is pregnant, and he may be the father. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I didn't realize as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had this much power. Did you see the wedding gift she gave to the new couple? New Zealand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am stunned that people are not more upset about this. You know $8.7 billion...of our money has gone missing in Iraq. I didn't even know they had a Goldman Sachs over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I love this. Goldman Sachs has told all their employees now that obscene words will no longer be allowed in any more office e-mails, because at Goldman Sachs, obscene words include integrity, trust, fairness, hard work, honesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen photos of the event? It looked lovely. I mean, Hillary was there. She was wearing a strapless pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, Bill had his attorneys add some wiggle room to the wedding vows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was funny, at one point Bill Clinton...accidentally backs into an ice sculpture at the reception and he goes, 'Whoa, Hillary!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight with a bit of media news. You may remember that a seat in the White House press room became available a few months back when Helen Thomas...retired after telling Jews to leave Palestine and go back home to Germany. ... Ironically, Thomas' retirement led to a territorial dispute over who would get her tiny, purely symbolic piece of land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several organizations put in bids for the front row seat. Ladies and gentlemen, who gets it? ... 'Fox News has a front row seat on the Obama Administration.' Fox News! Finally in the front row! Oh, so that's why they get much...wrong. They couldn't hear. They were too far back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Thomas seat replacement is the biggest story to come out of White House press room since 2006, when they broke the huge story about the remodeling of the White House press room. So, White House press room, still America's number one source of news, about the White House press room.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to start off by saying happy birthday to President Barack Obama. He is...49, which is eight points higher than his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you would like to get him a gift, he's registered at Bed, Bath, and Blame it on Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the cake they had for him? He had a huge cake. A little different than most birthday parties. What he did was he didn't blow out the candles, he just taxed them until they finally gave up and went out on their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raul Castro, brother of Fidel Castro, said on Sunday that his government will scale back on control on small businesses. It will lay off unnecessary workers and allow more self-employment. So, apparently, he sees how bad socialism is working in America. He doesn't want it to happen there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Sent troops to invade a Cold Stone Creamery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Read details of his surprise party on Wikileaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Got a new fake birth certificate he wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Read 'Eat Pray Love' and bawled his eyes out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Asked birthday party magician if he could make Sarah Palin disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Fist-bumped with Snooki and The Situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Went to Pizzeria Uno for their 'Shrimp &amp; Crab Fun-Doo' with the guys from NORAD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Flew Air Force One to Party Depot to buy helium balloons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. .Sat alone watching 'Real Housewives' marathon on Bravo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Stuffed Tony Hayward full of nickels and beat him like a pi?ata.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to President Barack Obama. Today, the President is 49 years old. ... He blew out all his candles and wished for his old job back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's 49 years old and I want to tell you something -- and believe me, I'm no political expert -- but it's&quot; not a &quot;good sign when your age is higher than your political approval rating. Never a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's begin tonight in Washington. As you know, we talk a lot on this program about how Congress can be somewhat ineffectual or short-sighted or ignorant or a feted pool of corruption and stupidity located at the intersection of Entitlement Avenue and Abject Dereliction Of Duty Lane. I'm sorry, what are we talking about again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ah, Congress! Credit where credit is due. Last week the House of Representatives took up a pressing issue with bipartisan support. ... 'Mr. Speaker, our committee can do great work when we work together.' Yes we can! And what better reason to work together than on a bill providing health care for 9/11 first responders and relief workers currently suffering chronic health problems directly related to their brave service? It's one of Congress' finest hours. But I'm sorry, sir, I cut you off. Continue. ... 'This is not one of our finest times.' Hey, what the ? What?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the President's 49th birthday. And, of course, Democrats are using it to drum up support by holding birthday events around the country, including a 'presidential potluck' in Phoenix, '49 Candles for America' party in Des Moines, and a Hawaiian luau in Austin, Texas. And Honolulu, I assume, will reciprocate by holding a dolphin rodeo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, when I want the latest news on Fox News, I turn to Fox News. ... 'MSNBC and CNN on Wednesday received terrible ratings while Fox News dominated, as usual.' They tout their ratings so much, I'm surprised they don't slap a blonde wig on them and give them their own show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I was surprised that Fox didn't cover the recent story that a full 1.38% of their audience is black. That's 29,000 viewers. Personally, I had no idea so many African Americans were terrified of Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I've had my research team...break down those numbers. Of those 29,000 black viewers, it appears 45% are trapped in the waiting room of a Jiffy Lube, 7% are white people who just enjoy watching Fox News in black face, 25% said Glenn Beck's name three times in the mirror and his show appeared, and the remaining 23% is Juan Williams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama turns 49 today. Finally, his numbers went up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A stripper jumped out of a cake at the White House and said, 'Oops! Wrong president.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama announced he is pulling our troops out of Iraq. Good news. ... Bad news ? they're leaving through Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you all familiar with the 14th Amendment? ... That's the one that says anyone born in the United States is a citizen. If your parents jumped over the fence and you were born here, you are a citizen. ... Well, a lot of people are trying to repeal it. And now, Senator John McCain says he now supports holding hearings on overturning the 14th Amendment, which is kind of odd, because when it passed back in 1866, McCain actually voted for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the Salahis? They kept having parties at the White House and the Salahis would show up and they weren't invited. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it was last week President Obama appeared on a show called 'The View,'&quot; which is hosted by women who talked &quot;his ears off. But he lives with his mother-in-law, so he doesn't care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know it was this week in 1861 the first Federal income tax was instituted to pay for the Civil War. Of course, these days, we don't worry about that kind of stuff. Our wars are now paid for by our grandchildren. We're in good shape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have started this thing. They're getting -- 40 billionaires have promised to give half their money to charity. And today, in a related story, Heather Mills has changed her name to charity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, listen to this. After saying they wouldn't, after saying there was no way this was going to happen, the US Marshal Service has admitted yes, it is storing tens of thousands of naked body images taken from airport scanners.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an Iraqi woman has come out with a book where she claims she was Saddam Hussein's mistress for the past 30 years. ... It's called, 'Who's Your Baghdadi?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exxon's profits last quarter are nearly double what they were the same time last year. Well, petroleum experts say it's because of their new slogan, 'Hey, We're Not BP.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the number of Americans receiving food stamps has risen to a record 40.8 million. And experts say, without this assistance, many Americans would find obesity out of reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Postal Service reported a $3.5 billion loss in the last quarter. They lost $3.5 billion, thus establishing themselves as the Federal government's most successful enterprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Obama celebrated his birthday by playing basketball with...LeBron James...and a lot of other NBA stars. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reggie Bush and the entire team were there. It was like the old days. You had a mess in New Orleans, the economy in a recession, and a Bush in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's top economic advisor -- a woman named Christina Romer -- announced she is leaving. They say she'll probably go back to teaching. Well, you know what they say: 'Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Wall Street Journal' says there's a movement growing to replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the Democratic ticket in 2012. ... In response, Hillary said, 'Come on, that is just silly. Make it so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A growing number of Democrats want President Obama to replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton as a running mate in 2012. And by growing number of Democrats, I mean President Obama and Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston is going to run for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, in a new reality show. The show is called, 'Who Wants to be Mayor of Wasilla,? Seriously, Anybody? We Just Need Someone with a Pulse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no, this threat is lurking up in the double digits, in the most sinister amendment of them all. ... 'A growing number of Republicans are calling for dumping the 14th Amendment, revoking the citizenship of people born in this country if one of their parents is an illegal immigrant.' 'The 14th Amendment -- Lindsey Graham, among others, is proposing that we repeal the provision where you get automatic citizenship if you are born in the country.' 'The 14th Amendment was written and passed, I think, in 1868, at a time when we had no immigration law.' And that's a good thing. If there was immigration law, the Indians could have had us deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That fool, Levi Johnston, is running for mayor of a city in Alaska. He's off to a good start. He cheats and can't keep a promise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the world champion New Orleans Saints visited the White House earlier this week. You probably saw this. They presented President Obama with a Saints jersey with the number 44 on it, in honor of his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, a year ago, the President's numbers were above 70&quot; and Tiger Woods' &quot;numbers were below 70. Now, they've changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Charlie Rangel told the House yesterday he will not resign despite 13 charges of ethics violations.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you guys hear that Levi Johnston is running for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska. ...

What an idiot. So stupid, that guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the last 18 or so months, Barack Obama's been the President and Democrats have controlled both houses of Congress.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's national security advisor says that the President may be willing to meet with the Iranian president. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there's been a lot of criticism over President Obama's -- what they're calling his 'sports week.' Last Saturday he played golf. On Sunday, he played basketball with LeBron James. On Monday, he met with the New Orleans Saints. The White House is defending them. They said everyone needs leisure time and thanks to these economic policies, 9.5% of all Americans have all the leisure time they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unemployment among teenagers, at an all-time high. All around the world, not just here. All over the world, kids are finding it hard to get jobs. In China, it's so bad kids as old as seven are having to move back in with their parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie opening today that I'm excited about is 'The Expendables.' ... There are cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supposedly in the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger ? he's only in it for about five minutes -- but he accomplishes more in those five minutes than he did in his entire time as the governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama had a little vacation over the weekend, on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The President and his family spent just over 24 hours in the Gulf. Some Republicans are actually attacking him for not staying longer. They do have a point. President Bush, for instance, used to vacation for weeks and weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is trying to help tourism on the Gulf after the oil spill. He even jumped into the Gulf to prove it was safe. Unfortunately, he did a cannonball right on to a pelican. Nothing goes right for this guy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is him. 'You don't believe the water's clean? How about I pull my 9-year-old daughter into it? Sasha, do not swallow, you understand me? Do not let a drop of this filth into your mouth.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously in this day and age, Muslims will take any reason to party, especially in the face of continuing controversy over the so-called 'Ground Zero mosque.' It's an issue on which the President himself weighed in on Friday. 'I understand the emotions that this issue engenders, and Ground Zero is indeed hallowed ground. But let me be clear. As a citizen and as President, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country.' Boom! Religious freedom. ... You can't be any more clear than that. ... Usually when Obama says the 'let me be clear,' he's about to get...very unclear. ... Usually, he says, 'Let me be clear. There is no way I would not un-support the kind of project this isn't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...that's not what this was. This was the principled guy that people ? I'm sorry? There's more? Okay. 'I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there.' Oh. Well, that's walking it back a little bit there. That kind of reminds me actually of his campaign slogan, 'Yes We Can, But Should We?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you all had a fun weekend. I did and the President certainly did. He went for a swim in the Gulf of Mexico. Then, I assume the Secret Service scrubbed him off with Dawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After that he played mini-golf, and Sasha got a hole in one. Yes. An adorable attack on small business owners, forcing them to foot the bill for her free game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then let's see. Took his family on a boat ride. Got some ice cream and, oh, yeah, he endorsed jihad! 'I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan.' You know what? I've been wrong, and I owe the President an apology. You're not a secret Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can cite the Constitution and the Bill of Rights all you want, but what about our Gutstitution and the Bill of Frights? ... Technically, Muslims have constitutional rights, but since 9/11, we gave up a ton of our constitutional rights -- search and seizure, trial by jury, habeas corpus. I don't even know what that last one means. I think it's the Little Caesar's mascot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of all...we have given up the right to privacy. I can't make a phone call without hearing Dick Cheney breathing on the line. He still uses lungs, right? Okay. Good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, after 9/11, the intelligence community realized they failed to connect the dots. So they came up with the simplest answer -- more dots, please. 'The money spigot was just opened after 9/11, and nobody dared say, 'I don't think we should be spending that much.&quot; 'The intelligence community is apparently larger, much larger: 1,271 government organizations comprise our intelligence community; 1,931 private companies are tied to it.' 'There are 854,000 people with top secret security clearance.' More people have top secret security clearance than have Pop Secret security clearance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, these are dangerous times. That's why we need the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Counterterrorism Center, the National Drug Intelligence Center, the Office of Intelligence Support, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Information Security Oversight Office, and, of course, the National Bureau of On-Screen Graphic Overload.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, folks, we are now protected by so many secret programs that the incoming Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, 'There's only one entity in the entire universe that has visibility on all (programs) -- that's God.' That means God's a spy! That's why he's always undercover as a burning bush or a grilled cheese sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our analysts have to keep up with a massive flow of data. The NSA alone processes 1.7 billion electronic intercepts per day, and that's just from Kanye West's Twitter page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, the system is clearly working. As retired general John Vines says, 'Because it lacks a synchronizing process...we consequently can't effectively assess whether it is making us more safe.' Which means it's making us more safe. You see, if our enemies infiltrate our spy networks, they, like us, will have no...idea what is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, I am calling on Congress to make our intelligence system even larger with a new agency to monitor our existing agencies: The National Central Homeland Surveillance Bureau of Intelligence Agencies Agency. The NCHSBIAA, or Inchisbiaa, whose great seal features an eagle looking up its own a#@.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number one movie at the box office this weekend was 'The Expendables.' Or as in Arizona, they like to call them, 'the Mexicans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite part of the movie ? there's one scene between Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger that needed to have subtitles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a great deal of excitement here in Los Angeles this week. President Obama paid us a visit. ... He was here for a star-studded fundraiser held at the home of John Wells. They raised one million dollars and converted him to scientology, so it was a success.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what's the 'gaping hole in our security'&quot; that &quot;Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert&quot; is &quot;so worried about? 'Explosive claim that pregnant foreigners are coming here to give birth to future terrorists. Babies with US citizenship under the 14th Amendment who will then be raised and trained overseas and to come back...20 or 30 years from now and attack us.' ... That's your gaping hole? ... Have a baby here, take it away for 20 years to raise it as a terror baby to then have it come back and attack us. That's...not&quot; a &quot;hole in security. That's the new Will Ferrell movie, 'Baby Make a Boom Boom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I'm sure that Rep. Gohmert realizes it's probably easier for a terrorist to recruit Americans than to count on terror babies doing what their parents want them to. Because, you know, when they become terror teens, they tune you out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is America, Louie. They got terror babies? Guess what we got? ... Hero babies! Take your best shot, terror babies,&quot; because hero &quot;babies don't run! Yet. About a year and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, our country's most famous immigrant, Barack Obama -- and I hope I pronounced that name correctly -- he took a half-hearted swipe at the problem. 'President Obama signed a new $600 million border enforcement bill that sends 1,500 new agents to the Southwest border and pays for more unmanned drones to patrol it.' Big whoop. We've got 140,000 troops in Afghanistan and that place is still crawling with foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, there are a few practical ideas to control the border out there, like this one from Rand Paul. 'I think you should actually put an electronic fence under the whole border.' Yeah. An electric fence under the border. We just need to get the Mexicans to wear those dog shock collars. Then, it would work. It's humane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then there are those whack job suggestions, like, 'Why don't you just stop hiring them and they'll stop coming here.' Come on! They're so cheap.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of dumb, a new poll finds that more and more Americans believe that President Obama is a Muslim. Almost one in five of us believe this. According to the poll, 43% didn't know what religion Obama is. Only 34% correctly said he's a Christian. Which is crazy ? remember...during the election, when all anyone could talk about was his crazy friend, Reverend Wright, and how he couldn't be trusted because he belonged to this guy's church for 20 years?

How is this being ginned up?' So...your answer to attack on freedom of religion is an investigation threatening to chill freedom of speech? ... What is wrong with you people? There is an all-you-can-eat buffet of things you could be saying and doing right now to win the hearts and minds of the country. And instead, you're acting like...Democrats. You're acting like Democrats, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This: 'It was the first day of shrimp season today. And for the first time since BP oil began seeping into Louisiana waters, the shrimp boats headed back to work.' Yes, it is shrimp season.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday today to John McCain.&quot; He is &quot;74 years old. ... They're going to have a big party for him this weekend. ... All his friends will be there. Joe the plumber will be there. Joe the cardiologist will be there. Joe the urologist will be there. All his friends. And he'll be at Denny's, blowing on his soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain, running again&quot; for the US Senate. He is &quot;facing a...tough re-election: 18 percent of the people polled in Arizona believe he's a Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there's even a new movie out about John McCain. ... Big, big hit. It's called 'Eat Pray Nap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make sure I mention&quot; that on Saturday, Glenn Beck will host a rally at the Lincoln Memorial. Beck &quot;didn't intentionally schedule his rally...for the anniversary&quot; of Dr. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech,&quot; but it &quot;does turn out to be an absolutely appropriate synchronicity. 'This is about'&quot; the &quot;'things that Martin Luther King stood for -- the content of character, not the color of skin. But people have been acting as though no white man can mention or praise or support the mission of Martin Luther King.' ... Who acts like white people can't praise Martin Luther King? Or is it that they don't want people who...called Barack Obama, the first black president, a racist, to praise Martin Luther King? Because here's something that's never happened to me: 'Uh, Martin Luther King is one of my personal heroes.' 'Oh no you didn't! No you didn't, white boy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, it's a tough job market out there. That's why I always try to keep you abreast of the latest job openings. And today, there is a big one. Fox News White House correspondent...Major Garrett has announced that he is leaving the network. Now, according to Garrett, he is leaving Fox News for the 'National Journal' because he wants to 'talk less' and 'think more.' So, if you're an unemployed reporter who likes to talk but does not like to think, Fox News is hiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Fox News, nation, I am brimming with anticipation. ... Because in just two days, Saturday, August 28th, Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor to America ceremony will be held in Washington, DC. And this isn't just some picnic. This is the picnic that changes everything. 'It may not change America tomorrow. ... I know it will in 25 years. Because somewhere, there will be an eight-year-old boy or girl that will rise to be the next George Washington.' Thanks to Glenn, some beautiful eight-year-old will grow up to be a hatchet-wielding, toothless slave owner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, no surprise, folks. The restoring honor haters out there are upset that Glenn is holding his 8/28 rally on the steps of the Lincoln memorial, the exact location and date of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. Well, big whoop: 8/28 is also the birthday of Jason Priestley. You don't see his panties in a bunch. Though, I wouldn't mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Miss Mexico. She has been crowned the new Miss Universe. ... They were originally going to give it to Miss USA, but Miss Mexico said she could do the job for a third of the cost.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, the new Miss Universe says she likes to spend her time walking, taking long walks on the beach, playing sports, and eating at fancy restaurants. ... I'm sorry, that's the President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest polls, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has an approval rating of 59%. Very high. Experts say this is because he has put socialism behind him and improved the economy. In fact, it's worked so well, many Democrats in Congress are thinking of trying it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a report in 'Time' magazine, experts say that this recession...is good for people because fewer people drive to work, which means fewer deaths and auto accidents. Fewer people can afford to eat, so we don't gain as much weight. ... You know what that means? President Obama's economic plan is also his healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you...the economy is not good. Oh, the economy is so bad, today, President Obama had to play golf on a public course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the only housing stock in the United States now are mosques in New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the weekend, Glenn Beck and Al Sharpton both held rallies on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech back in 1963. How many have a dream both Glenn Beck and Al Sharpton will go away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And man, how about those 33 trapped miners down there in Chile? ... They have plenty of food and water, but they're saying the rescue could take three months. ... I had no idea BP was operating down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five years ago, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. ... Now, that's not to be confused&quot; with the Gulf disaster. Hurricane Katrina &quot;was not British Petroleum's fault. That was the other Gulf disaster. Completely different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush...observed the fifth anniversary of Katrina by doing exactly what he did when the hurricane struck. Nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend marked five years since Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. ... Back then, the economy was in a mess, there was a huge disaster in the Gulf, the President was on vacation when things were falling apart. Thank God that could never happen today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama spoke in New Orleans over the weekend to mark the fifth anniversary. One embarrassing moment -- halfway through his speech, FEMA finally showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview with Brian Williams, President Obama said, 'I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead.' Apparently, he was reacting to new polls showing that one in five Kenyans now believe President Obama was born in Hawaii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would it make any difference if President Obama's birth certificate was on his head, huh? I mean, most of the people who want to see it can't read anyway, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well...Roger Clemens, forced to testify before Congress. Congress is very upset with Clemens, because they felt they were lied to. ... Good! Now you know how we feel!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something odd. I'm in Las Vegas over the weekend. ... You know the hotel complex New York, New York? You know what they're building in it? A mosque.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is in bad shape. ... The economy is so bad, stockbrokers who jump out the window now are asking for frequent flyer miles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, Glenn Beck had to speak to 100,000 people today about Herbalife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Never Before Said In An Oval Office Address:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you know the big story last night. In only his second Oval Office address, President Obama announced the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. ... He said, 'We have given the Iraqis a western style government.' Well, we certainly have, haven't we? Their economy is in shambles, their congress is corrupt,&quot; and &quot;their country is broke. Welcome aboard. ... Nice to have you here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before the speech last night, President Obama called former President George W. Bush. I'm not saying the economy is bad, but he called collect, okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they had a pretty cordial conversation. President Bush said the last 19 months he has been relaxing and playing golf. President Obama said, 'You, too?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Obama...said there are too many Americans struggling to find jobs. You know what these Americans are going to be called? Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Miss Mexico, who has been crowned the new Miss Universe. ... Her family is so proud, they are now thinking of moving back to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today on MSNBC, they described the Tea Party movement as overwhelmingly white. Wow, just like MSNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see the address last night? ... President Barack Obama said the Iraqi war was over, and I'm telling you, this thing was dragging on and on and on, and people said, 'What is the point?' And I said, 'It's like this show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the President has been busy.&quot; He &quot;redecorated the Oval Office and then he took another two-week vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the Iraqi government is now relatively stable. It's hard to believe, isn't it, after all this time? ... They've had fewer changes in regime than the 'Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton is denying rumors that she will replace Joe Biden as the vice president in 2012. ... It's fun to have&quot; a &quot;Clinton denying stuff again, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the 2012 presidential campaign has begun. ... Sarah Palin's going to Iowa to give a speech at a big Republican dinner, and Mitt Romney is giving a speech&quot; at a &quot;New Hampshire dinner. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is encouraging. Middle East peace talks are under way in Washington, DC, between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

That's the lineup of 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Middle East leaders said peace in the Middle East may be doable within a year. The year -- 2525.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The homeless population in New York City has gone up 50% in just the last year. ... Advocates say...a lot of the homeless people living on the streets are drug addicts and alcoholics, but most, of course, are investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is so bad, I called tech support for my computer today -- a guy in America answered.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We go out and we buy a lot of products made in China. ... That's how we celebrate Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the middle of a debate last week, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer suddenly -- did you see this? Stopped speaking, looked down at her hands, started giggling and had a blank stare on her face for 30 seconds.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US commanders in Afghanistan are now ending their policy of zero tolerance on corruption. They're ending the zero tolerance on corruption policy and allowing local government officials who are on our side to be moderately corrupt. Well, it's the same policy we have here in Congress. It's the exact same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow in Cleveland, President Obama will be laying out a new economic plan. You know what that means? Apparently we had an old economic plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to CNN, more and more children are now attending virtual schools online. Isn't that unbelievable? Which is perfect for today's economy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how bad the economy is now. President Obama's going, 'You're right, I wasn't born here. Thank you, good night, everybody.' That's how bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama, listen to this, proposed a $50 billion job bailout. He wants to rebuild roads, $50 billion. Rebuild roads, going to rebuild runways, going to be rebuilding railway lines. Going to be rebuilding his presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Y'all remember Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska. There is a article about her in a magazine that says she's a lousy tipper. ... I'll give you an example how cheap she is: Dinner for four, a steak dinner. She left only two pelts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand, you think 'Bad tipper? Wait a minute, I don't know' because a couple of years ago she gave back 20% of the vote to Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his speech in Milwaukee yesterday, president Obama complained that Republicans talk about him 'like a dog.' Then Biden got up to agree with him and Obama was like, 'Biden, sit!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of the Mideast peace talks, President Obama held a conference call with rabbis this afternoon. Yeah, Obama didn't get to say much, though, because we had to listen to, 'Oh, we have to wait for you Mr. Big Shot? You never call and when you do, you can't wait to get off the phone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the elections the &quot;Democrats are going to have to make tough calls. I guess they'll have to make some sort of panel to, I guess, pull the plug, so to speak, on candidates -- oh, my God -- the death panels are real! Oooooooh! And they are using them on themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats' problem isn't their ideas or their desperate strategy it's really that no matter what they do it doesn't (bleep) matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what happened&quot; with Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's performance in her debate. &quot;Her brain fart lasted the same amount of time it takes the guy from quantum leap to realize he is in a new body.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was in Cleveland today delivering his latest economic plan. He picked Cleveland because, see, those are the Browns fans, and in September they'll believe anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one awkward moment when the [President's] speech ended at lunchtime. 9.6% of the crowd had no jobs to go back to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has introduced a $50 billion plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. Now, let's think back, wasn't -- remember the first $787 billion stimulus package? Wasn't that what that was supposed to do? Remember we were told this is what they call 'shovel ready jobs'? Remember that? Remember that? So whenever Washington talks about shovel ready projects, get your shovel ready...because you're gonna be shoveling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starting today, travelers flying to the United States from certain countries will be required to pay a $14 entrance fee. 14 bucks to get into the United States. See, that's to keep out the riffraff. They do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP has just come out with their own report on the gulf oil spill. You hear about this? See who they're blaming it on? Reggie Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Center for Health Statistics has announced that the birthrate has dropped for the second year in a row. They say it's due to two factors -- the recession and, of course, Levi Johnston now wearing a condom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following this story of this moron pastor in Florida who wants to have a 'Burn The Koran Day'? Well, now General Petraeus said this could cause problems for our troops in Afghanistan. This pastor claims he is going to talk to God before he decides what to do. How many think God has this guy on his do-not-call list?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs Your Governor Is Losing It:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Closes every speech with &quot;Glee&quot; style song and dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Giggles uncontrollably when saying the word 'gubernatorial'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Still hiding in crawlspace waiting for Hurricane Earl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Puts on wig, pretends to be his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Still wearing white after Labor Day ? hel-looo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Describes leadership style as a mix of Jefferson, Churchill, Blagojevich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. You get him on the phone and he barks like a dog. [Editor's note: Letterman held up a phone while barking was played] That's Gov. Patterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. At least once a week, wakes up naked on roof of the capitol building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Makes no secret of the fact that she entered politics to meet Justin Bieber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She resigned from running Alaska to work for Fox News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is trying to back Republicans into a corner by paying for tax cuts on small businesses with tax hikes on big businesses. It's like that old trick when you take two balls, and throw one high in the air to distract your opponent. Then throw the other one right at his chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're for or against it, you have to agree choosing Cleveland to announce new taxes on the rich was a great move. Cleveland's a blue collar town. They're always up for pinching the nipples of rich dudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama also said in the speech he wants to close major tax loopholes for big oil companies. Which I'm like 'Oh, really taking a stand there, Mr. President.' Going after the oil companies, that is risky, isn't it? These days, oil companies are about as popular as Michael Vick at a dog show, I would say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's touring the country to push his $50 billion plan to rebuild roads and runways around the country to help get people working. The Department of Labor unveiled a new website to help people looking for jobs. The way it looks is, I went on it today, you register your information, you check off your aptitudes and the kind of work you're looking for, you scan the results and before you know it, another day of unemployment is behind you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BP &quot;released a big report with their explanation of what caused the millions of barrels of oil to flow into the Gulf of Mexico. They took very little blame for the spill. They pointed fingers instead at rig workers, Halliburton, Transocean, Sasquatch, and I think Tiger Woods.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to government auditors...stimulus money is being held up because there aren't enough government workers to oversee the spending.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government auditors &quot;said the stimulus money's being held up because there aren't enough government workers to oversee the spending. So follow me. In other words, government workers who aren't there are needed to spend money we don't have to create jobs that don't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Fidel Castro told Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to stop slandering the Jews. And today Ahmadinejad blamed the Jews for making Castro say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Castro also expressed some doubts that the Communist economic model introduced by his revolution more than 50 years was ago n working. Most Cubans heard the announcement on a 1954 RCA deluxe console TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BP has just released the results of its own internal investigation into the cause of the gulf oil spill. Turns out they are not responsible. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of state Hillary Clinton commenting on&quot; planned Koran burning&quot; says that it's an indiscretion that we should ignore. Like she did with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll found that only 41% of voters approve of President Obama's job performance. When he heard this, Obama was like, 'Okay, but how do they feel about my vacation performance?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Merriam Webster said that Sarah Palin's made up word 'refutiate' was the most searched-for word of the summer. Yeah, but matter how hard they looked, supporters couldn't find the word in the definitionary or wordasaurus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That crazy pastor down...in Florida -- remember, he was going to burn the Quran? ... He's now suspended&quot; that plan. He &quot;says, instead, he's now just going to rip up a couple of copies of the Watchtower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, have you heard this guy talk? ... He said he's now looking for direction from God on where to go. You know, I can't speak for God, but I think if he grabs a shovel and starts digging, he's heading in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Atlantic' had a big article on the inevitability of Israel going to war with Iran over building nuclear weapons. But the White House thinks that strong economic sanctions will bring them to their knees, raise unemployment, and cause their factories to close, the same way those economic sanctions work right here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy's in bad shape. The economy is so bad, women in Beverly Hills are now telling their real age just to get the AARP discount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that President Obama wasn't wearing his wedding ring during his White House press conference today. I guess that makes the press conference the second most difficult speech he's going to have to give this weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world is waiting nervously tonight as Florida pastor Terry Jones decides whether or not to burn copies of the Quran. He originally planned to burn them tomorrow, on September 11th. Then yesterday, he called it off because he believed he made a deal with an imam, which is a Muslim leader, to stop the plan to build a mosque near Ground Zero. The imam said that wasn't true, he agreed to no such thing. ... Jones said he was lied to, the burning was back on. This guy ? he's like the Brett Favre of burning books. He's back and forth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, the plan is to hold off on burning the Quran. Actually, they're...thinking of lightly toasting it with a George Foreman grill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even though nothing has happened and this guy is -- I hope the world realizes he's one nut from a church the size of a Sunglass Hut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is ? he's caused a lot of anger. There have been violent demonstrations in Afghanistan about this. Hundreds of people -- I saw one report said three protesters were injured and one was killed in one of these demonstrations. ... Aren't they all on the same side? Why is someone being killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of funny. Our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the robot -- made fun...of Sarah Palin on his Twitter page last night. Arnold was on his way to Asia. He posted a picture of himself looking out the window of his plane. ... And he wrote, 'Over Anchorage, AK. Looking everywhere but can't see Russia from here. Will keep you updated as search continues.' ... I think sometimes he forgets he's not really bulletproof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tough one for Sarah Palin, because not only is Schwarzenegger a fellow Republican, when she was a teenager, she had a Conan the Barbarian poster hanging on the wall of her igloo. So this really...hits home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new report, 41 of President Obama's White House staffers now owe the government more than $831,000 in back taxes. ... When asked if they could just keep avoiding taxes, they said, 'Yes, we can! Yes, we can!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government announced today a $60 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, the biggest in our history.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The premiere of 'Hawaii 5-0'&quot; has been shown &quot;right here on CBS. How many of you saw that show? ... What a great episode. The cops are looking around and they accidentally stumble on Obama's birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, according to experts, the recession is over. ... What I want to know is, is it really over or is it pulling a Leno?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden says...the stimulus is working. And he also says his hair plugs are working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking about Bob Woodward's new book, 'Obama's Wars.' In the book, he says Joe Biden called Middle East adviser Richard Holbrooke 'the most egotistical bastard I've ever met.' Then, Rahm Emanuel was like, 'What am I, invisible?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woodward's book also reveals that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has severe mood swings. But Karzai was like, 'That is not true!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The airline industry expects to make $6 million more in profits this year than originally&quot; expected, &quot;mostly because eight more people plan to check their bags this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the media vultures out there are circling around Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell, the way Christine O'Donnell used to circle around anyone with a video camera. I mean, controversial clips are popping up all over the place, and Bill Maher has threatened that more are on the way. 'I have 22 episodes, Christine. If you're watching, you need to come on this show. If you don't come on this show, I'm going to show a clip every week.' Bill, you cannot do that. It will take time away from Ashton Kutcher discussing credit default swaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, no surprise, Bill O'Reilly is taking the high road. 'I'm trying to be fair to Christine O'Donnell. She's been on this program a number of times, and we have some kind of crazy stuff that she said. We're not going to play it yet. I'm not in the business to injure her.' ... Good for you, sir. Showing her clip is beneath you. But not me. ... 'American scientific companies are crossbreeding humans and animals and coming up with...mice with fully functioning human brains.' ... She's right, folks. How else could Stuart Little have memorized his lines?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is actually starting to lose the support of black voters. It is getting so bad, they said by the time the election rolls around, he might not even vote for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unbelievable. Even Michelle Obama's mom...pulled her aside in the White House and said, 'Girl, you can do better than that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how bad it is. Now, his daughters are asking the Secret Service to drop them off two blocks from the mall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last Friday, comedian Stephen Colbert ruined Congress,&quot; when he &quot;mocked our legislators to their faces!&quot; Colbert &quot;went to Washington, walked into a congressional hearing room, and testified on the plight of undocumented farm workers, stealing a job that is traditionally done by baseball players on steroids and not really at all...apologetic CEOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't the only completely humorous C-SPANiard who was offended. 'It's a serious issue. It's broken. And they call in Colbert as the first guy?'

'They've got time to bring a comedian to Washington, DC, but they don't have time to eliminate the uncertainty by extending all of the current tax rates?'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is out on the campaign trail. At the University of Wisconsin, President Obama to the crowd, 'Let's show Washington one more time, change doesn't come from the top.' Well, if it doesn't come from the top, what did you run for president for?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A witch and a whore. Oh, boy! You get the government you deserve, Don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former California Governor Jerry Brown, who is running for governor again, denied it was his voice calling his opponent Meg Whitman a 'whore.' Apparently, there was a taped phone conversation, and after Brown hangs up, you hear someone say, 'Why don't we call her a whore?' ... But it's unclear if the voice is Jerry Brown's or someone else's. See, that's where I'm going to miss Governor Schwarzenegger. You always knew it was him. 'Yah, she's a whore. Da prostitute!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tea Party candidate Christine O'Donnell&quot; says in her &quot;new ad&quot; that she &quot;'didn't go Yale like my opponent.' I think that's pretty self-evident. Isn't it? There's no need to tell us that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's now reported that the economy lost 95,000 jobs in September. And that's just people leaving the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another top person has left the Obama White House. National Security Adviser Jim Jones. He's gone. You know, the White House is like 'Dancing with the Stars.' Every week, somebody else gets voted off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last week was especially tough for the President, because two of his advisers announced they were leaving. And to make matters worse, Joe Biden announced he was staying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pakistani intelligence officials...say this terror alert we had last week ? remember this terror alert about the al Qaeda plot to attack targets in New York -- it was politically motivated, it's not based on any credible evidence. That's what Pakistan said. And well, if we can't trust the people who have been hiding Osama bin Laden for the last nine years, who can we trust&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel prizes are being given out. ... A Nobel Prize went out today for the category of fiction. That went to Christine O'Donnell's resume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's safe to assume that Carl Paladino, who's running for governor of New York, is not excited about Coming Out Day being on Columbus Day. Carl Paladino told a group of orthodox Jewish leaders in Brooklyn yesterday that he wants to make sure children aren't brainwashed into believing that homosexual relationships are equally valid, I guess, as heterosexual relationships. And he criticized his opponent, Andrew Cuomo, for marching in a gay pride parade with his daughters. So I guess he's planning to decorate the governor's mansion himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paladino says he's not anti-gay, he just believes people in heterosexual marriages are happier and more successful. So, he's encouraging all gay men to go out and marry a straight woman immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has been busy lately, trying to drum up support for fellow Democrats. Both he and Vice President Biden were at a rally in Philadelphia this weekend,&quot; where &quot;somebody threw a book&quot; at Obama. Bush &quot;got a shoe thrown at him, Obama got a book. I think we're making progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We turn now to 'Indecision 2010: Unforced Errors Edition.' We begin in California, where former governor and always running for governor Jerry Brown was just starting to win his most recent gubernatorial auction from former eBay CEO Meg Whitman. Basically all he needed to do was stay the course, and he would become the governator once again. ... 'We're going to play a tape for you that has someone on the Jerry Brown calling Meg Whitman a name that is usually reserved for prostitutes.' Desiree? Cinnamon?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Someone from the Jerry Brown campaign was caught on tape calling Meg Whitman a word that rhymes with bore.' 'We can't say the word on television. It rhymes with war.' 'A bad word that rhymes with snore.' Is this...a bad Dr. Seuss book? How old are you people?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was a political group classified as a 527, meaning that they could receive unlimited corporate donations for their political ads as long as they did not explicitly tell people to vote for a certain candidate and also reported the names of their donors to the IRS. I know what you're thinking. That sounds pretty restrictive. Well, don't worry. The Supreme Court Citizens United ruling fixed this 527 un-loophole, allowing other groups not bound by the ban on pre-election candidate advocacy to feed more fully from the corporate trough.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything in Chile is going well. The last miners are being brought up as we speak. So once all 33 miners have been rescued, that means the only one still stuck in a hole of his own making&quot; will be &quot;President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nobel Prize for Economics&quot; has been &quot;awarded to three economists. Should we have even given one out this year? ... If there's one thing we've learned in the past few years, it's that there's no such thing as an expert in economics, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama Administration has lifted the six-month ban on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. They can go back to drilling, provided the oil companies follow...new safety regulations. For example, under the new rules, there has to be at least one sober person on the rig at all times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the artist community over here in North Hollywood&quot; is &quot;called NoHo,&quot; which, &quot;ironically, is also Meg Whitman's new campaign slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman has released a new TV ad in both Mandarin and Cantonese. This is part of an effort to reach out to the Asian community. See, that's how&quot; it works in California, &quot;where a white woman from back east trying to replace an Austrian governor runs an ad in Chinese to explain to people why she hired a Mexican maid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea is getting a new evil dictator. ... Kim Jong Il&quot; has &quot;named his own replacement. ... It's his dimwitted son, Kim Jong W. Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama&quot; is &quot;trying to reconnect emotionally with his supporters. I gave up on that years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The midterm elections&quot; are &quot;in three weeks. The Democrats are at a huge disadvantage, and I'll tell you why. They don't have a witch running. That's the problem. They need a witch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the debate with Christine O'Donnell? ... She's trailing in the polls by 20%, so she'll need a miracle to win. Or a really good spell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was moderated by Wolf Blitzer. It got pretty intense. At one point, O'Donnell turned Blitzer into a real wolf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those Chilean miners are finally being rescued. ... President Obama was actually watching some of the rescue effort on TV today. Obama said he just wanted to see how they dig people out of a giant hole in other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is kind of interesting. According to Ancestry.com, Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh are President Obama's tenth cousins, which means Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh are secret Muslims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what to think. One minute, Obama is an illegal immigrant, the next thing you know, he's the lost Limbaugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out Obama and Palin share family genes. Specifically, mom jeans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President was -- they say he was amused by the revelation. And well, Sarah Palin, I guess now we know why the mainstream media treats her so unfairly. It's because she's black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On CNN tonight,&quot; they &quot;aired...a debate between two Delaware Senate candidates, mostly because Christine O'Donnell is a nut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's not polling very well in Delaware.&quot; O'Donnell is &quot;down 18 points. When given a choice, most Delaware voters said they would rather vote for the lion or the wardrobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had the third and final debate this week between California gubernatorial candidates Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman. In case you missed it, it went something like this. 'Whore.' 'Jerk.' 'Bitch.' 'Old man.' 'Slut.' 'Loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that the Democrats have the momentum going into the midterm election. Of course they do. You always have momentum when you're going downhill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Joe Biden said Democrats up for election aren't running on their accomplishments, because they're too hard to explain. So basically he's saying either the voters are too stupid to understand or the Democrats are too stupid to explain it. You know what's even harder to explain? Why a Democrat is letting Joe Biden talk with an election just a couple of weeks away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Joe Biden said today President Obama has asked him to run again with him in 2012. So, I think I speak for all late-night hosts -- thank you, Mr. President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the first time in history, there were 100,000 home foreclosures in the month of September: 100,000 people were told this fall they're going to lose the house, 100,001 if you count Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, there is a witch down there in Delaware -- Christine O'Donnell. And they had a television debate last night. And the moderator kept saying, comment about recent Supreme Court decisions. And the only one she could come up with was -- she said, 'Hmm. Cox versus Arquette.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the first debate was at podiums. And the next debate will be at satanic altars, so I think she's going to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know Kim Jong Il, the evil dictator of North Korea. ... He's stepping down, and he has appointed his son Kim Jong Un as his successor. If you don't know, Kim Jong Il has three kids -- Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Nan and then the daughter, Kim Jong Dashian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a big night for President Obama. He appeared earlier tonight on the MTV town hall show,&quot; which was on &quot;just before the new episode of...'Jersey Shore.' Yes, nothing says low approval ratings like agreeing to open for Snooki.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But appealing to the young voters is a good idea, because Obama has to find people so young that they're not already disappointed in his performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is still talking about the amazing rescue of those miners in Chile. ... Experts thought it would take 48 hours, but it ended up only taking less than 24. That's right. BP was like, 'Pfft! We could have done it in six months.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some big political news. Joe Biden told 'The New York Times' that President Obama has already asked him to be his running mate in 2012. Not only that, he said Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney and the rest of the Republicans also asked him to be Obama's running mate in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a crazy morning on 'The View' this morning. Bill O'Reilly from Fox News was the guest. It ended up with Joy and Whoopi storming off their own show. You'd think people named Joy and Whoopi would be more cheerful, but not the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, down in Delaware, Tea Party darlin', Christine O'Donnell, squared off against Democratic Senate hopeful Chris Coons. Finally a chance to put all that...witchcraft&quot; talk &quot;away and get back to what voters in Delaware really care about. 'Earlier, you said you didn't want to have to talk about comments you made years ago about witchcraft and stuff like that, but in this commercial that's so widely seen, you begin...with the words, 'I am not a witch.' What were you thinking?' 'To put it to rest, to put it behind me.' 'But didn't you realize if you do that in a commercial, it would just revive it and everybody would be talking about that?' Hey, hey! Take it down a notch, white beard. You're a staff and a cloak away from getting tenure at Hogwarts, buddy. Seriously. I mean, Wolf Blitzer. J.K. Rowling wishes she thought of that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, folks, it's sad, but the national media is attacking Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell by digging up embarrassing video clips from her past. Today, they dug one up from all the way back on, last night at 8:00, in her debate against Democratic opponent Chris Coons. ... 'What opinions, of late, that have come from our high court do you most object to?' 'Oh, gosh, um, give me a specific one. I'm sorry.' 'Actually, I can't, because...I need you tell me which ones you object to.' 'Um, I'm very sorry. Right off the top of my head, I know that there are a lot.' Nailed it!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe she'll get eliminated next week. Better be soon. Mid-November is typically when the Palin family goes into hibernation. She needs to spend the next six weeks gorging on salmon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight,&quot; the guest is &quot;Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman. He was actually appointed to serve out Vice President Joe Biden's term and has spent that time as an outspoken advocate for the people, working tirelessly to break up the big banks. So naturally, he's completely fed up and quitting after less than two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, we are just four days away from my and that other guy's rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC. ... And if you have not booked your plane ticket yet, get walking and bring a tent, because the hotels are booked. And, unfortunately, the Democrats' offices won't be vacant until next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, the midterm elections are next week, and we're finally going to take our country back, from the people who stole it, by being elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Less than a week until the election. ... I was thinking about that. You know, it's a shame that either of these parties has to win, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama left a big political fundraising event in Rhode Island yesterday. He left early. ... He told the audience he had to go home to 'walk the dog and scoop the poop.' You know what that means? His dog has created more shovel ready jobs than he has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Congressman Charlie Rangel has dumped his legal team and will represent himself at his upcoming ethics trial. Is that a good idea? I mean, he's a politician and a lawyer. He puts his hand on a Bible, it could explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another threatening audio message from Osama bin Laden. This time he's threatening the French. Bin Laden is angry that Muslim women in France cannot wear their burqas in public. You know bin Laden. If there's one thing he can't stand, it's somebody denying women their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the psychic octopus in Germany that would go game to game and pick&quot; the World Cup soccer &quot;winners, the psychic octopus? ... He's dead. ... He was stomped to death outside a rand Paul Rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington, DC, was under a tornado watch today. It was pretty crazy, especially when the White House landed on Christine O'Donnell, and her feet curled up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I look at the Democrats' chances in the midterms. I assume, under an electron microscope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the homestretch, ladies and gentlemen. The midterm elections are next Tuesday, whereas I've been telling my Democratic friends, next Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Emotions are running high, folks. You can feel the excitement pounding in your heart. Or, if you're a liberal activist at a Rand Paul rally, pounding on your head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me explain. It seems Lauren Valle, a 115-pound female MoveOn.org activist, got her cranium dangerously close to Rand Paul outside a Kentucky debate. But luckily, two men had the courage to throw her to the ground and hold her down while a third hero stomped on her melon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, while liberals' faces are getting stepped on in Kentucky, everywhere else, it's their hopes and dreams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Democrats can brag that they stood against Obama on the most important vote of all, like Mississippi Democrat Gene Taylor, who last weekend proudly announced that he voted for John McCain. That is brave. If only more people in his district had followed his lead, they probably wouldn't be represented by a gutless Democrat like Gene Taylor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am glad the Democrats are finally showing some spine, a spine that can best be seen as they run away from their record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, Laura Bush says now that George Bush is out of the White House, he should pick up his dirty socks and towels. Basically, he is doing the same thing he did as President -- making a huge mess and expecting somebody else to clean it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election Day less than a week away. Of course Republicans are just counting the days&quot; until it will be their &quot;turn to screw things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 'Entertainment Tonight,' Sarah Palin says she may run for president in 2012 if there's nobody else to do it. Today, a poll came out showing that voters prefer nobody else to do it over Sarah Palin, two to one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure I understand this. NASA has received initial funding for a long-term manned mission sending astronauts to Mars. We'll send the astronauts to Mars and then leave them there. They stay there. We won't be able to bring them back. They would fly to Mars and we leave them there. Don't we finish anything in this country? 'Oh, we got you there! That's good enough!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Halloween? .. Oh, it's the scariest day of the year, if you don't count Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday is Election Day. Millions and millions of Americans take time off from their jobs on Tuesday to pretend to go vote, so it's going to be a big day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you found this to be true, that there is a lot of confusion about the election? For example, that Delaware witch who is running for Senate -- Christine O'Donnell, -- she thinks that the Jon Stewart Rally To Restore Sanity is actually a Rally to Restore Satan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the San Francisco Giants,&quot; who won the &quot;first game&quot; of the World Series. The &quot;Rangers lost and that Cliff Lee, man, this guy got beat up pretty bad. It was like watching a Rand Paul rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a campaign stop in New York this week, Joe Biden said to a volunteer, 'If I had your hair, I would have been president.' In response, the guy was like, 'If I had your hair, I wouldn't bring up the subject of hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Esquire' magazine ranked President Obama one of the world's best-dressed politicians, while North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il was ranked best dressed female janitor who also happens to be a politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A court just ruled that voters in Arizona don't need to show proof of citizenship at the polls next week. When asked about the ruling, some said they were 'on the fence,' while many said they 'just hopped over it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other scary Halloween news, tonight on 'ET,' Sarah Palin sat down with Mary Hart. 'Are you going to run for president?' 'You know, I've not decided what I'm going to do in 2012.' ... Great. One quick question. Why are you announcing this to Mary Hart? Billy Bush wasn't available? Couldn't get Mario Lopez on the phone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next Tuesday's election is an important one. It's not just about selecting the candidate who may or may not best represent your political values. It's about choosing between hard-line Marxist state tyranny and autocratic Taliban religious crazies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll came out that says that most Americans think President Obama is underperforming. ... Obama admits that the economy is in rough shape, but says the Republicans have just been sitting around watching and drinking Slurpees. That explains why the Republicans are crazy. Brain freeze!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's a great way to scare Californians this Halloween -- remind them our choice for governor is Meg Whitman or Jerry Brown.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal investigators have stopped a man named Farooq Ahmed...from&quot; carrying out a &quot;terrorist plot against the DC Metro system.&quot; He had &quot;planned to bring Washington, DC, to a standstill. Hey, you're a little late. ... After two years of Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, we're already there, alright. Mission accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another terrorist threat today. Apparently, a toner cartridge that had been suspiciously modified was discovered aboard a UPS cargo flight. You know, that's the last time I order my toner cartridges from the Office Depot in Yemen. ... I mean, you save a few bucks, but it's nothing but problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess President Obama was notified about this last night at 10:30. He was notified about the threat. And Homeland Security said, 'This had the potential to be almost as bad for the White House as Tuesday's midterm election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. If we find a package that contains one of these bombs, and especially if it's a UPS package, why announce it on the news? Just stamp return to sender. Put it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove said this week that Sarah Palin does not have the 'gravitas' to be president of the United States. Sarah Palin is furious. She says as soon as she finds out what 'gravitas' means, she will respond, and harshly!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just can't get through Halloween fast enough. ... They got the lousy games that you've got to play. And I always hated the bobbing for apples. ... Or as Dick Cheney used to call it, 'apple-boarding.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a sobering thought -- on this very day in 1929, the stock market crashed. And you know why it crashed? Wall Street greed. ... Thank God they fixed that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you folks know about this WikiLeaks deal? ... Somehow they get secret government military papers from the CIA, from the state department,&quot; and &quot;from the Pentagon,&quot; and &quot;then they release them on WikiLeaks. And everybody goes crazy because they're secret, and they think, 'Oh, what do we do now?' I'll give you an example of the kind of stuff they're releasing. It turns out now, the CIA...knew about Leno getting a show at 10:00. ... And they did nothing to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many think the Democrats will keep the House? How many are too busy worried about trying to keep their own house?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the good news -- the President was campaigning to enthusiastic crowds wherever he went. People were cheering and applauding. The bad news -- the President that was campaigning was Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I like down there in Kentucky is that Rand Paul. ... Here's a guy that...likes having rallies and then he likes having people stomped on. So if you show up at a rally, be prepared to get stomped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Rand Paul goons saw a woman with a sign that they didn't like as he was driving by in his motorcade. So they wrestled her to the ground, because she&quot; was &quot;carrying what appeared to be a dangerous sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they get her down on the ground, and then the guy who did the stomping...said, 'I can't ? I've got a bad back. I couldn't bend over, so I had to use my foot to keep her head on the ground.' Oh, okay. Well, once you know the facts, everything's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, there were bomb packages from Yemen sent by the same guy...who did the work&quot; for the &quot;guy who had the underpants bomb? ... This guy has made more bombs than Kevin Costner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is Election Day. Some interesting news -- the final poll before the election shows that 55% of Americans plan to vote for Republicans, while 40% plan to vote for Democrats. ... I guess Obama is finally going to get that change he was talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems most experts are predicting that Republicans will win back the House tomorrow. ... When Americans heard that, they were like, 'Wait, we can win back our houses?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama sent out an email encouraging his supporters to take at least three friends with them to vote. That's not how people vote. That's how women go to the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DNC released a last-minute ad that says, 'Don't let Sarah Palin win. Vote tomorrow.' The weird part is, it ends with the line, 'I'm John McCain and I approve this message.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California will vote on Prop 19 tomorrow to...legalize marijuana,&quot; which &quot;means thousands of stoners will be at the polls, going, 'Dude, just pass it. Just pass it! Thanks. Now let's vote on Prop 19.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very special night tonight on 'Dancing with the Stars.' It was their 200th show. ... It's more important to vote for your favorite dancing star than it is to vote for anyone or anything in these so-called elections tomorrow, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midterm elections are tomorrow. President Obama was out making last-minute appeal to voters. He told them, 'Don't look at the polls, don't look at the cable news prognosticators, in fact, don't even look at the ballot, just mark the dots in at random and we'll have a better shot at winning that way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In just a few hours, voting will start at the biggest election in this country since two years ago, with both sides campaigning furiously to get their base to the polls. Republicans, you're up. Of course, they've been decrying the lack of bipartisanship in Washington, which they apparently will decry right up until they retake control of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Democrats are striking back with their most powerful weapon -- total delusion. 'I believe that we'll hold on to both houses.' 'Yes, I believe that Democrats are going to hold on to the House.' 'If it's a Republican tidal wave, I've sensed a Democratic undertow going against it.' 'There's a blue thunder that's going to stop the red wave.' Well that's your problem right there. If you want to stop a red wave, you don't use blue thunder, you use some sort of blue seawall, or a blue retaining area. Thunder's only good if you're trying to scare dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How bad has it gotten for the Democrats? They had to send in former President Bill Clinton to campaign against other Democrats. 'Bill Clinton tried to persuade Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek to drop out of running in the three-way race for the Florida Senate seat.' .. Why is Clinton backing lifelong Republican Charlie Crist over the Democrat? 'Clinton and a top aide thought they had convinced Meek to drop out, thus delivering liberals and moderates to Independent Charlie Crist and preventing Republican Marco Rubio from winning.' Ah! Rather than vote for the guy who would agree with them on most things, they'll settle for the guy who has never really agreed with them on anything to keep out the guy who won't talk to them. That's from Sun-Szu's 'The Art Of War...The F@*k Are You Doing?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is that time of year, when people dress up and hide who they really are. That's right. Tomorrow's Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the Obamas welcomed trick-or-treaters to the White House. One kid refused to be photographed with the President, because he's running for student council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is All Saints Day. Tomorrow is Day of the Dead. And Wednesday's Day of the Dead Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is likely that tomorrow, Barack Obama is going to lose the House. So then he'll know how a lot of other Americans feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, former President Clinton was campaigning for an Ohio congressman when the dude's wife suddenly went into labor. Out of habit, Bill Clinton said, 'That's not mine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new election is going to lead to a huge disaster -- Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to acting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'Indecision 2010,'&quot; a &quot;Tea Party-ganza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is incredible. Many of the results are in. The GOP is now projected to take 692 seats from the Democrats, out of a possible -- well, there were 100 that were up for grabs. But somehow they have managed...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, actually they're projected now to take 60 seats and retake the House of Representatives. The Democrats are projected to keep the Senate. We're going to get to some results here.&quot; In Connecticut, the &quot;state that your train goes through when you're trying to reach a real city, Democrat Richard Blumenthal has defeated Republican Linda McMahon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina Senate race ? this is very interesting. Obviously, South Carolina the fourth best Carolina, out of North Carolina and then two that don't exist and then South Carolina. Jim DeMint has defeated Alvin Greene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many residents, of course, in Florida voted early and obviously then went right to eat dinner. ... Marco Rubio has defeated Charlie Crist&quot; and Democrat Kendrick Meek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, as always&quot; with &quot;pre-election coverage,&quot; there was a &quot;lot of predicting. This year's prognostications very greatly&quot; depended &quot;on whether the person predicting...was a Democrat or anybody else in the world other than a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York,&quot; Carl Paladino's &quot;campaign to not be elected governor has succeeded. Andrew Cuomo is the victor. Paladino, of course, tried very hard not to be governor. He must be feeling very pleased tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Wisconsin,&quot; Russ Feingold &quot;defeated for having progressive values. In Louisiana, David Vitter has absolutely destroyed his challenger by going out with hookers. All right. ... So really, what is the message we're sending to America tonight? It is better to, I think, go see prostitutes than...believe Social Security is a right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we will be riding a...GOP barrel all the way to Tax Cut Beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today as Americans, we got to see democracy in action. I hope that we've all exercised our fundamental right by voting Bristol Palin off 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, today is Election Day. I hope everyone voted...because I did. I am very interested in the democratic process. Also, Latinos love free stickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were so many propositions in California this year, it was confusing. I saw one billboard that said, 'Vote No on Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama was on Ryan Seacrest's radio show this morning, urging young people to vote. He was the fifth caller, so he got two tickets to see Usher on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama also put out a video today on AOL.&quot; It is &quot;great that he's reaching out to old people, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama did not call&quot; the San Francisco Giants &quot;to congratulate them&quot; on winning this year's World Series. But Obama &quot;did call the Texas Rangers after the World Series and said, 'You guys can still pull this thing out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surprisingly, a lot of people in the Tea Party movement are in favor of the legalization of marijuana. ... That explains all the crazy stuff they said this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some medical marijuana dispensaries in California are selling a very potent strain of pot that's called 'Mel Gibson.' ... I thought weed was supposed to mellow you out. That's like naming virgin olive oil after Snooki.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do the Democrats have in common with Charlie Sheen? They both woke up this morning going, 'What happened late night?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday,&quot; they had the &quot;mid-term elections, unless you're the Democrats. Then it was the end-term elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Republicans won by a mudslide. ... To give you an idea of how bad it was, today, President Obama changed his slogan from 'Yes we can' to 'I've fallen and I can't get up.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, all year long, the Democrats have been telling people to get out the vote. And yesterday, people told the Democrats, 'We voted, now get out!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now that...Republicans have gained control of the House, John Boehner is going to replace Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. So we've gone from the 'Botoxer' to the 'Bronzer.' I'm not sure that's really improvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact,&quot; Boehner's &quot;new slogan ? 'Yes we tan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how the different TV news networks covered the election last night. Like, on MSNBC it was called 'Election Night 2010: What Went Wrong.' At Fox, it was 'Election Night 2010: Party, party, party!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And despite being caught paying $300 for a prostitute, Senator David Vitter easily won reelection. See, this proves that voters respect a fiscal conservative like Vitter, who only spends $300 on his hooker, as opposed to a wild-spending liberal like Eliot Spitzer, who spent $5,000 on his hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it wasn't all good news for...Republicans&quot; as &quot;pro-witchcraft candidate&quot; Christine O'Donnell &quot;lost by a big margin. At least now she can tell people she dabbled in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here in California, Meg Whitman...spent $160 million of her own money on her campaign and lost, to which the Yankees said, 'Hey, join the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Jerry Brown, the new old governor of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can sure tell it's winter. The Democrats have gone into hibernation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, while you were applauding, three more states turned red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Washington, DC, today,&quot; volunteers &quot;were washing the mud off Democrats and releasing them back into the wild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans are in charge now, ladies and gentlemen. And we all remember how well that worked last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters didn't like the way President Obama was handling the economy. Wait a minute, he was handling the economy? What?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, Ohio Representative John Boehner succeeds Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House. He will be our first orange Speaker of the House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, down in Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, the witch, she lost the election. She conceded, congratulated her opponent, and then vanished in a cloud of smoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying that Christine O'Donnell's career in politics may be over. I think, however, she still has about six months left as a punch line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rand Paul? Guy was elected, and wasting no time, went right to Washington and started stomping Nancy Pelosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did everyone watch the election results last night? Oh, man, it was a terrible night for Democrats in Congress, but a terrific night for moving companies in the Washington, DC, area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was really emotional watching the results on TV. I don't know what was more touching -- John Boehner starting to cry or Nancy Pelosi trying to cry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people went on Twitter to complain that the font size used on ballots was too small. ... People who got the small fonts were like, 'I can't see anyone I want to vote for!' People who got the regular size fonts were like, 'I can't see anyone I want to vote for!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election day is...over. ... Some pundits are saying that the Republican gains actually might be good for President Obama. because instead of just saying no, they'll actually have to do things. And their top two priorities are cutting taxes and reducing the debt, which is kind of like your top two priorities in life being to lose weight and win the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. So, we'll see what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sean Duffy, who was on 'The Real World Boston,'&quot; ran in &quot;Wisconsin and...actually won his race,&quot; which &quot;hopefully bodes well for a certain President Snooki in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, last night&quot; they had the &quot;midterm elections. ... Big night for the Republicans. They decisively took back the House of Representatives ? 239 seats to the Democrats' 185, with 11 still to be decided -- increased their margin of control of the Senate from 41 seats out of a hundred to 47 seats out of a hundred, with one race still in question. Now some would argue, 'They don't have control of the Senate. That's less than 50. Don't the Democrats still control the Senate?' The people that would argue that just have no idea how fu@3ed up the Senate really is. It is a silly and ridiculous place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I recap the results of least nights mid-term elections. Parents, if you have Democrats, you might want to have them leave the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats lost badly in the election yesterday. Fortunately for President Obama, his healthcare plan covers a@#-kicking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new Speaker of the House. His name is John Boehner. He said Republicans will work for all Americans -- white American people and very white people, and the albinos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President called Boehner to congratulate him. Then he went upstairs to the Oval Office to update his resume on Monster.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, Meg Whitman spent $140 million of her own money to be governor and still lost! ... To get back some of her money that she lost, she put her housekeeper up on eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meg Whitman blew $140 million in one year. She definitely has a future as a rapper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday night, voters completely rejected the efforts of a charismatic African American who was only trying to do the best job he could. Rick Fox is off 'Dancing with the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday not good for President Obama either. ... People just gave up hope, went for the change.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Present Obama lost 66 Democrats. And not one of them was Joe Biden. ... How frustrating is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican John Boehner will take over as Speaker of the House from Nancy Pelosi. Let me tell you something. That's not going to be easy. Those are mighty big eyes to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Federal government announced that it will pump an additional $600 billion into the economy. I guess they feel they have to make up for what Meg Whitman isn't spending anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, Meg Whitman lost to Jerry Brown, despite spending $141 million of her own money. See, that prove she's not cut out to be a professional politician. You don't spend your own money. You spend other people's money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the big Republican landslide, ladies and gentlemen? ... I tell you, nobody's laughing at my John Boehner tattoo now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see President Obama's press conference the day after Election Day? .. He looked a little sad, a little disappointed. I mean, it was like last night's audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's the thing about the President. I mean, one day you're up, one day you're down. But you got to keep...doing the job. In fact, this weekend,&quot; Obama is &quot;going to India on business. He will be traveling on Air Force One Term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's future now depends on Republicans and Democrats working together. ... We're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush&quot; has written a &quot;book...called 'Decision Points'. And it will be out next week. ... I've already made a decision not to buy it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his new book, George W. Bush reveals that he considered dropping Dick Cheney from the 2004 ticket, because he wanted to demonstrate that he was in charge, not Cheney. But then Cheney nixed the idea, so they went back to normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 'The Today Show,' Bush said that his new book will be a 'data point for future historians.' Then he said, 'That's kind of a mind bender. Future historians. They should just call them 'nows.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, everyone is still talking about the unemployment rate. ... This week, it went up about 65 Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a grand tradition in the great country of ours. Each quadrennial presidential contest shall be followed biennially by a thorough and robust congressional referendum. And in such instance whereupon the President's party receives unto a whooping of a@s, the President shall then in due haste present forth an obligatory post-electoral, red-carpeted, impodiumed walk of shame. So it is written, so say we all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;could have done a whole ton of jokes, like, uh, 'White presidents take a midterm electoral defeat like this: 'I can't believe you rebuked my policy.' But black presidents...take an electoral defeat like, 'Oh, no you did not rebuke my policies! No you di-in't! Whaaaat?!&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, still no results in Alaska's Senate race. The suspense is killing me. Which republican will win?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lopez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has just been announced that President Obama is going to India and China next week. Everybody is probably like, 'Why?' To visit our money and our jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it was a rough day for incumbents. But some of them held onto their jobs. Barney Frank reelected in Massachusetts. John McCain reelected in Arizona. So Congress still has Barney and the dinosaur. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like John Boehner will be the new Speaker of the House. He is the son of a bartender, one of 12 children. He grew up in a two-room home with just one bathroom, worked his way through school, became the first person in his family to graduate from college, and, sadly, fell in with the wrong crowd and wound up in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who Boehner is, right? He's that orange-looking guy. See, Republicans -- that counts as diversity. ... In the Republican Party, he is a man of color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston said in an interview that Sarah Palin is not qualified to be president. And, believe me, if there's anyone who knows about not being qualified for something it is Levi Johnston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those elections? We have a Republican House, we have a Democratic Senate, and we have a president with veto power. Smooth sailing, right? No problems there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda...now&quot; has a &quot;branch in Yemen. ... They have more franchises than the 'Real Housewives.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one kind of awkward moment. When he met the president of India,&quot; Obama &quot;asked him, 'What do you think? Windows Vista or should I upgrade to Windows 7?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy Pelosi, who lost her position as Speaker of the House, says she will seek to become the House Minority Leader. And really, who better qualified to be House Minority Leader than the person who led their party to become a minority in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC news anchor Keith Olbermann will be back to work on Wednesday, after being suspended without pay for giving campaign contributions to Democratic candidates, which is against the rules at MSNBC. See, if only he had done like Eliot Spitzer and given his money to hookers, he would have gotten his own primetime show on CNN.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President George W. Bush has written his memoir. It's called 'Decision Points.' I've already decided not to read it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll be everywhere promoting the book. He's...going to be on the 'Today Show,' going to be on the Oprah Winfrey show, and tomorrow he'll be on the Rachel Ray Show, waterboarding veal cutlets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the book, George Bush claims that he's happy to be out of Washington. Well, that makes it unanimous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you thinking about buying the George W. Bush book? It's a big, thick book and it -- when are you in the bookstore, you can&quot; use it &quot;stand on&quot; and &quot;get a better book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush is on the big book tour this week. During an interview with 'USA Today,' Bush said that he was 'blindsided by the financial crisis.' Bush said he was also blindsided by the fact that he knew the word blindsided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his trip to India yesterday, President Obama said that he has to make some mid-course corrections if he wants to win over frustrated Americans. ... And then people in India were like, 'You think you have to deal with frustrated Americans. Please! 'Did you unplug it, sir? Did you unplug it?' 'Of course I unplugged it. What the heck do you think I did?' 'I'm trying to help you, sir. Did you unplug it?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the great thing about America -- we all have the freedom to have our own opinions and say and do what we wish. 'MSNBC has suspended Keith Olbermann for making political donations.' Almost everybody has that right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Olbermann broke an MSNBC rule by making campaign donations without first obtaining permission from the network. Because MSNBC has a hard and fast rule that political donations represent bias in journalism, unless you ask first. 'You learn your manners, boy, or I'll knock you down to hosting 'Headliners &amp; Legends' so fast, your head'll spin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; there is &quot;no telling how long it will be until we see Keith Olbermann again. 'MSNBC says...Olbermann will be back on the air tomorrow night.' Lesson learned. Yes, MSNBC ? it's a stupid rule, but at least it was enforced poorly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the Republicans are making such a big deal out of it, saying how expensive the trip was. They said the President was staying at the Taj Mahal. He was not staying at the Taj Mahal. Turns out he was staying at the Taj Mahal Express, near the airport. Smaller...hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama traveled to India because he said it's becoming one of our most important trading partners. For example, we give them our American jobs, and they give us -- what the hell? Do we get anything out of this? Have we gotten anything out of this? No! We don't get anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Barack Obama is traveling. He went to India, then I believe South Korea, then Japan. He's going to keep traveling until he finds his birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush's memoir is out today. And the guy is apparently quite candid, quite honest in the memoir. It's a big, big book. The problem is because of his economic policies, nobody can afford to buy the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the guy, the President, he is still quick, still very athletic. ... He proved today at a book signing that he can still duck a shoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the book, Bush says that he lost respect for John McCain when he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate.&quot; This is coming from a &quot;guy whose running mate shot a buddy in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just a few hours ago, former President George W. Bush appeared on 'Oprah.' ... When asked about being a leader of the free world, Oprah said, 'It's not bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and the California high-speed rail authority has voted to spend $4.3 billion to build rail line for either Merced to Fresno or Bakersfield to Fresno.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy in Indonesia wrote this book about president Obama. Did you hear about this? It's 5,472 pages long, the thickest book in the world. The book is called, 'One of Obama's Speeches.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China is expected to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, 'That hasn't happened already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the power went out, the food on the&quot; Carnival cruise ship &quot;spoiled. And the Navy had to send food.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's Asian tour&quot; has &quot;not been too successful. At the economic summit in South Korea, President Obama said, 'Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.' ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one awkward moment when President Obama went to pay for lunch, the Chinese President Hu Jintao said, 'Your money is no good here.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody said to me, 'Did you hear that they are running on the Discovery Channel, or one of those things, the show with Sarah Palin?' And I said, 'What happened? Did we run out of Kardashians?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the name of the Sarah Palin show is 'Bleep My Ex-Governor Says.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush has a new memoir out and he was talking in an interview and he said that he thought that Sarah Palin was not qualified to be president. Well, isn't that the pot calling kettle black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by the way, when does not being qualified to be president disqualify you from being president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush says now that he hardly ever leaves Texas. Former President Bush says he hardly ever leaves Texas. Hell, when he was president he hardly ever left Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton met with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for six hours at a hotel yesterday. When Hillary saw that she had a six-hour meeting at a hotel, she was like, 'Wait, I think this is Bill's schedule.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Bill Clinton, today he released a statement where he called George W. Bush's new memoir 'well-written and interesting.' Then Bush released a statement calling Clinton's lie 'convincing and much appreciated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's ten-day, post-election Asian sojourn has ended. It was a trip filled with high-level political intrigue, pomp, circumstance, and the kind of citizen of the world theatrics that have so endeared the President to his critics. 'Indonesia is a part of me. I am back home.' Don't believe him, Indonesia! Ask for his Indonesian birth certificate! He's actually from Hawaii! He's tricking you! It's what he does to become president of your land!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I can't wait to hear about his trip. I bet he thinks he hit a home run. 'Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles. But they're really important singles.' At least he's...not using cricket references.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'President Obama's Asia trip was a total disaster. 'His economic view somewhat rejected.' 'No resolution with China over their currency valuation.' 'He failed to reach a free trade agreement with South Korea.' 'No cooling of tensions between India and Pakistan.' .... ' This is a troubled time in America. Why is he going on this long trip?' 'This was an extraordinarily expensive trip.' 'Another chapter in the great American apology tour.' 'What did he get besides really nice photo ops?' ... I haven't seen a trip reviewed this badly since the Griswolds went to Vegas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow. Barack Obama is just terrible. Republicans especially are coming down on him mercilessly. I bet they miss the good old days when they had a president they respected. 'Under Clinton, you had a president who was willing to compromise.' 'Bill Clinton, who you depict in your book ? he was a flexible guy.' 'Yes.' 'He learned how to compromise with conservatives to get things done.' 'If he's willing to work with us, as Bill Clinton did after the 1994 elections to pass things like welfare reform, trade agreements and the like, we'll certainly work with him.' That's right. Republican darling Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of you may be too young to remember the feel-good 1990s, when a universally respected President Clinton reigned over an eight-year bipartisan love-fest. Let me give you a taste of what it felt like back then. 'Let the sun shine, let the sun shine' -- and by the way, that is what they were singing at his impeachment hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, that's how I remember it. Oh, but I was high for nearly the entire decade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess for Republicans, Clinton is like a fine wine -- the more you drink, the harder it is to remember, 'Oh, I...hate wine!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton apparently has a cameo in the new 'Hangover 2' movie. When asked why Clinton is in the movie, the producer said, 'There are some things Mike Tyson will not do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sunday night was the debut of the reality show 'Sarah Palin's Alaska.' Hey, say what you want. It got huge ratings. Even -- even John McCain watched it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Halfway through the program McCain turned to his wife Cindy and said, 'Who is that woman? She looks familiar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wife of a Maryland politician is suspected of taking bribes was found with $80,000 in cash hidden in her bra. How big is that bra? $80,000? Is that a good place to hide it? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No guy would ever think to look there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House ethics committee has found Congressman Charles Rangel guilty of financial misconduct. You got to understand. Hey. Hey, you know, it wasn't easy. They had to go way outside Washington to find anyone who knew anything about ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't think Rangel gets it. Like, today, he said to pay his fine he's going to have to accept bribes now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has just released a new children's book. It just came out. Have you seen this? It's called -- right here. It's called 'Of Thee I Sing.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Michael Vick? He set a record last night, 59 points against the Washington Redskins. Yeah, that was unbelievable.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the groundbreaking ceremony of the George W. Bush's presidential library in Dallas. ... It's easy to get into the building, but then you spend ten years trying to find an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney attended the ceremony. It's fitting for Cheney to be at the library. He spent eight years telling Bush to be quiet, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When speaking about Bush, Dick Cheney said that Americans can tell a decent, good-hearted guy when they see him. Then he was like, 'Let me know if you do. I need that heart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a memo today from NBC. It says, since we have former President Bush on the show tonight, we need to maintain a higher standard of dignity during our broadcast, you see. No cheap or tasteless jokes, nothing crass, nothing juvenile. So good night, everybody. That's all we have for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many have flown since they instituted these new security procedures? Because you know, under these new rules, they can touch your breasts, they can touch your genitals, in some circumstances they can put -- put their hands down your pants. See, in the airport, that's a security check. In Hollywood, that would be an audition.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tempers are starting to flare at the airport. Today I saw one of those bomb-sniffing dogs said to another bomb-sniffing dog, 'Hey you lick my junk, I'll have you arrested.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A study has found that the collective wealth of Congress has increased 16% since the financial meltdown. Now over half the members of Congress are millionaires. Yeah, that explains why they haven't done anything about the recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats in the House have chosen Nancy Pelosi to stay on as their leader. She is the new House Minority Leader. Why -- why -- why mess with success, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller announced he wants the FCC to take both MSNBC and Fox News off the air, because he says they're both biased. He wants them both off the air. When asked about CNN, he said 'CNN? That's still on the air?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the opening of the George W. Bush presidential center in Texas, Dick Cheney joked that the center is the only shovel-ready project in America. Yeah. Well, I don't know about that. Dick Cheney taking a buddy hunting? That could be another shovel-ready project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an upcoming interview with Barbara Walters, Sarah Palin says she believes she can beat Obama in 2012. The way things are going right now, Bristol Palin could beat Obama in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you how confident Sarah Palin is. She's already started writing her inaugural address on her hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plans are now under way for a remake of the movie, 'Total Recall.' This one's a little different. It stars Congressman Charlie Rangel saying, 'I don't recall, I don't recall, I don't recall, I don't recall.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amazon.com announced they will hire over 15,000 temporary employees this holiday season. Most of them Democrats who were just voted out of office, but that's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TSA Chief John Pistole says he and his boss, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have each personally received the new, more invasive TSA patdown. It's being called the world's least sexy threesome ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A California district attorney has vowed to prosecute any TSA agent who touches a passenger inappropriately. Yeah, the DA says, there's a time and a place for inappropriately touching a Californian. It's called an audition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump wants to see if people want to see him run for president. So a Website has been launched called, 'Shouldtrumprun.com.' Yeah, the American public has respond with a Website by the name of 'No.com.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Levi Johnston has announced that he's not going to do any more interviews for a while. Yeah, when asked why, he said, 'Because I've already used all the words I know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the airport, &quot;They'll have either the complete body search where you're groped, or they'll put you through the naked body scan, airport security. And I'm saying to myself well wait a minute, why can't we have both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm all for it because if there's a guy walking around with a bomb, I want to know about that. So I don't mind the excessive, you know, the groping and the probing. My problem is when it's done, I don't know how much to tip the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They opened the George W. Bush presidential library out there in Dallas. They broke the ground already out there on Monday. I know you're snickering already. The guy never read a book in his life but he's got a library. How does that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush opening an library, that's like Kirsty Ally opening a can of Diet Coke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin says she's going to run for president in 2012. Donald Trump said he's going to run for president in 2012 against Sarah Palin. Nice to know there will somebody equally unqualified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that would be some presidential race. You've got Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. The debates, get there early and get some seats down in the front for those debates. You're fired, you betcha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are going to be problems when Donald Trump runs. They had a lot of problems with Obama, you wait until Donald Trump runs because the rumor is already that thing on his head, the rumor now is that thing on his head was not born in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is still trying to quit cigarettes two years into his Administration. President Clinton kept cigars in his office. But I don't smoke. During the Bush Administration, visitors to the Oval Office said it smelled like smoke. That's because Dick Cheney installed a dimensional portal to hell. It's a quick way to get home!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part one of 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' comes out tomorrow. Finally, a chance to see someone use a wand without running it up and down my leg at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard that American Airlines is going to start offering happy hour on certain flights in December. That's crazy. I mean, the TSA is feeling us up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday a group of economists unveiled a new plan to reduce the deficit by $6 trillion. All we have to do is switch from regular incandescent light bulbs to not having a Federal Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congressman Charles Rangel found guilty on 11 charges. And Democratic leaders say Rangel 'undermined trust in Congress.' Really? Trust in Congress? Huh, really? Who has any trust in Congress? Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
