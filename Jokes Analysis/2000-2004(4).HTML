<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;United Nations weapons inspectors say the terrorists might try to use a virus called monkey pox as a biological weapon. Monkey pox. Wasn't that the video game that came after Donkey Kong?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has arrested an American who allegedly had ties to the Al Qaeda and was planning to set off radioactive dirty bomb in Washington. See, a dirty bomb is a regular bomb coated with radioactive material to make it deadlier. It's the same principle behind a corn dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news -- listen to this. Today, Martha Stewart was able to defuse a dirty bomb using just lemon juice and seltzer water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton was invited&quot; to the wedding of Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, but &quot;I'm not sure if he made it or not. He was supposed to read the words of the song, 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you want Clinton at your wedding? No. The bachelor party. Yeah, that's where you want Clinton. He's in charge of the entertainment. You don't want him actually coming to the ceremony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI busted up an Al Qaeda plot to bomb New York City, and the FBI is so excited they announced they're going to take the rest of the month off. They're going to rest up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out one of these Al Qaeda guys was born and raised right here in Brooklyn, New York. Isn't that nuts? Yeah, Brooklyn, New York, but he was very easy to recruit. The Al Qaeda guys went to recruit him and they said, 'Look, if you martyr yourself you'll go to paradise where there's plenty of parking.' And he said okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gotti is &quot;the first member of his family to die of natural causes, that's true. And now that the Gambino crime family is falling a part, the biggest crime organization in New York City right now is the Catholic Church.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been quite a week. We had an eclipse of the sun earlier this week. At one point, 75 percent of the sun was covered. And afterwards, President Bush said, 'See, it proves solar power is unreliable.' . 'See, you can't depend - you can't depend on it.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, President Bush said he watched the eclipse through a little hole in an unread FBI memo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems our elite secret service counterassault team - these are the best - the elite secret service counterassault team has been watching pornography on the White House satellite system instead of watching President Bush. . See, that was a great thing - when Clinton was in office, they could have done both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that guy that was arrested for the whole 'dirty bomb' plot thing? It turns out he was a former Chicago gang member who later joined up with the Al Qaeda. How bad is the unemployment in this country - when you're forced to take a job with Al Qaeda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what he said the worst part about working for Al Qaeda was? Trying to get off for the Jewish holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is now backing away from how big a threat the dirty bomb guy was. Apparently, Ashcroft may have overstated this dirty bomb threat. . They said it was not a dirty bomb. It turned out the guy was just building a really bad stink bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;U.S. weapons inspectors say - this is another threat - terrorists might try to use a virus called monkey pox as a biological weapon. Have you heard about this? Monkey pox. . I don't want to stereotype anybody, but if you see a monkey wearing a turban, get the hell out of there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the FBI announced they're getting very close to finally capturing John Gotti. . Yes, they think they know where he is. They are closing in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS announced they're gonna do a four-hour miniseries called 'Hitler.' . It's gonna cover Hitler's birth through his rise to power in the 1930s, or as Pat Buchanan calls the show, 'Happy Days.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they've been arresting these Al Qaeda guys. They found out one of them is from Brooklyn, New York. We've got a local boy making good. . And he's the guy that came up with the idea for the dirty bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been reading about the dirty bomb? This background, his only other job was he worked at Taco Bell. . So I'm thinking, well, he's used to handling hazardous material apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think now despite everything you read Al Qaeda is desperate for new members. Earlier this week, they recruited three girls from the Ya- Ya sisterhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now admitted that he did not read the EPA report on global warming. That's a little alarming, isn't it? . He had a good excuse. At the time he was too busy not reading the CIA report on terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bush is indignant about this. He said if people wanted a President who was going to read reports and stuff, they should have elected Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles Lakers won their &quot;third championship in a row. In fact, they're calling this the most famous three-peat, well, since President Bush was in the eighth grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge has ruled that the alleged 20th hijacker, this Zacarias Moussaoui guy, can act as his own lawyer. Which is great for us. This way, when we execute him, we not only get rid of a terrorist, we kill off a lawyer, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UN weapon inspectors say these terrorists might try to use a virus called the monkey pox as a biological weapon against us. Monkey pox, that's the name of it. You know how to tell if you have monkey pox? Apparently, your ass turns a bright shade of red, and you throw feces at people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressional leaders announced today they will not give a quick rubber stamp to President Bush's new homeland security plan. It needs more work. See, this is what I love about Washington. A plan to protect our national security takes, what, months, years? But if you're a terrorist at the flight school, and you need a visa -- two weeks, there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After learning that 50% of Americans don't get enough exercise, President Bush is urging all Americans to take up walking and hiking. In fact, the first American to take a hike may be John Ashcroft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, President Bush, very upset with Attorney General Ashcroft for exaggerating this whole dirty bomb thing. Apparently, it wasn't that bad and Ashcroft kind of made more of it than it was. Ashcroft was not available for comment today. He said he was too busy tracking a giant asteroid that's headed this way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to former President George Bush Sr. George Bush Sr., 78 years old yesterday. Happy birthday. I thought this is nice. Today, George W. Bush gave him a tie holder he made while away at Camp David.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is being investigated on possible insider trading charges. Yeah. Yeah, I think Martha might be guilty because today, on her program, she showed viewers how to make license plates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US News and World Report magazine claims that members of the Secret Service regularly watch porno on the White House satellite system. That's what they said. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Yeah, which explains why President Bush's code name is 'Pizza Delivery Boy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the terrorist group Al Qaeda issued a death threat -- listen to this -- a death threat against rapper Eminem.because, in his latest video, Eminem dresses up like Osama bin Laden. Yeah, and not only that -- they issued a death threat against the Backstreet Boys because, in their last video, they dressed up like the Backstreet Boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden is operating a thing, a recruiting school in Florida to get new members of Al Qaeda. He has a recruiting facility in Florida to get thugs and terrorists into Al Qaeda. I'm thinking, wait a minute maybe this explains old people driving into buildings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, President Bush was very annoyed with Attorney General John Ashcroft for overstating that danger of that whole dirty bomb incident. I think there was a little bit of exaggeration there. Like, today, when Ashcroft called it the biggest threat to the American way of life since those naked statues.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday on CNN, Jerry Falwell got in a huge argument with Arab anti-discrimination spokesman. . But in the end, they managed to -- they found some common ground -- the Baptist and the Arab. Yeah, they both got together and blamed all their problems on the Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Zacarias Moussaoui.is going to represent himself in court. Since he has never studied to a be lawyer, you see, he has to be briefed on every move he makes during the trail. How to object, how to cross- examine, how to work for five hours but really bill for 30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Oak Park, Minnesota, say a man who performed 50 castrations on consenting men over the internet, may not have committed any crime because it is not illegal to castrate someone. Bill better hope Hillary never hears about this!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a really good day today for the President. . The town of Stockton, California, has announced that they're naming an elementary school after President George W. Bush. Isn't that sweet? I thought that was really nice. Yeah, not only that, they're naming the nurse's office after Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a brand-new interview, director Steven Spielberg said he thinks Americans would be willing to give up some of their rights if it will help the government defend the country. That's what Steven Spielberg said. As a result, the White House asked Spielberg to give up his right to make 'Jurassic Park 4.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More trouble today for Martha. You hear about this? Remember last week, Martha Stewart was in trouble over alleged inside stock trading.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration has apparently approved a plan to oust Saddam Hussein. Think that's President Bush's Father's Day gift to his dad, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is relaxing -- they call it relaxing -- the clean air rules for utilities.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the anniversary of the 30th -- it's the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in. 30 years ago today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also the last time a Republican president had a plan and actually carried it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Middle East, Israel has begun building a fence separating itself from the Palestinian area of the West Bank. A fence. Why didn't we think of that before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Ted Kennedy, calling for new guidelines that would reduce the number of prison rapes. Sure, now that his cousin Michael Skakel's going to jail, suddenly, it's a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US defeated Mexico in the big World Cup action. You know, this is a very, this is a big match. The last time the US and Mexico competed, Mexico lost Texas. Remember that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US team shut them out 2-0. 2-0. They couldn't get into our territory, essentially. You know what we should do -- pull the border agents out, put goalies down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard these reports about Al Qaeda? Al Qaeda they're saying is now listless, is confused, without direction, in total disarray. Oh, no, wait a minute. That's Al Gore. They're saying that about Al Gore. Forget that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is scary. Al Qaeda is in the US looking for people to participate in suicide missions. Whoa, isn't that frightening? I under they're talking to the New Jersey Nets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this idiot, this stupid woman, this 38-year-old, what is she? US Park employee. Admitted she started the Colorado forest fire after she got so mad at her estranged husband, that she burned a letter from him. Burned the letter up, started the whole thing. Isn't that ironic?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Denver, man? Denver, oh, man, looks terrible. Full of thick, black smoke. Toxins in the air. It's like LA's sister city now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal today, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has a secret advisory group, that are advising him on all this stuff, that includes Dan Quayle.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lawyers for the American Taliban, remember that idiot, that John Walker Lindh guy, has demanded that all charges be dismissed against John Walker Lindh because he has a First Amendment right to associate with the Taliban if he wants to. See, it's amazing, isn't it? Here's a guy, fights against our country, hates everything about our country. As soon as he gets arrested - 'Hey, I'm an American. I know my rights.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush called America's World Cup soccer team. And he told them, even though he doesn't know anything about soccer, he's rooting for them. Then, Bush called his economic advisers and said the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, what a beautiful day in New York, today. Isn't it fantastic? Oh, perfect! Here is how lovely it was today, Martha Stewart was doing her insider trading outside. It was that lovely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this for irony. You know the wild fire in Colorado? It turns out it was started by a woman who works for the Forest Service. It's crazy. She started a fire that destroyed 100,000 acres of pristine woodlands. It's like she's working in the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? George W. Bush and the entire White House staff is committed to a exercise program. Earlier today George Bush spent an hour on the cardio machine. He wasn't working out on it, he was trying to pronounce it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the FBI is searching the waters of Los Angeles for a container ship carrying 40 members of Al Qaeda. So if you see a bunch of guys in turbans standing of the deck of a ship singing, 'If they could see me now, that old gang of mine, we're eating fancy food,' call the FBI immediately.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And closing arguments began today in the trial of two Lebanese brothers charged with running a cigarette smuggling ring that benefited the terrorist group Hezbollah. They were terrorists smuggling cigarettes. You know what kind of cigarette they were? Camels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton said she and her husband both like different kinds of movies. Like, when they go to the Cineplex, she'll go see 'Ya-Ya Sisterhood,' he'll go see 'Unfaithful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people who live in Clinton, New York, are trying to change the name of their street, which is called Sodom Road. You'd think they'd be more embarrassed about living in Clinton, New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, here's a great stock tip. Listen, great stock tip. Just do whatever Martha Stewart does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess she wrote a letter today stating she had nothing to do with insider trading. In fact, she doesn't even call it insider trading. She calls it 'interior swapping.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Donald Rumsfeld, Osama bin Laden is no longer in charge of Al Qaeda. Yeah! Apparently he took a job over at ABC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have not captured a terrorist, one of those guys and he is 300 pounds. 300-pound terrorist? Terrorism is scary enough.but a 300- pound terrorist? He belonged to a splintered group of Al Qaeda, Al Rocca.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here from Minnesota? Your governor announced he is not running for office. He's had it. Now with him out, that means the only wrestler running for a governorship in this country would be.well, that would be Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura announced he would not run for a second term. Not gonna run. Not gonna run, yeah. That's true, yeah. In a speech at the statehouse, Ventura said, 'It's time to step aside and make room for other unqualified candidates.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now as many of you probably know, the Bush administration pushed through.a series of major tax cuts last year for mostly upper middle class and wealthy taxpayers. But now, the President is concerned that one group was left out of the equation. I'm referring, of course, to the 'super' wealthy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The estate tax, currently as high as 55%, is scheduled to be phased out incrementally until it disappears completely in the year 2010. However, in 2011, it comes back into effect at the full 55% rate. So from a tax perspective, 2010 is looking like a great year for a fatal yachting accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI continuing to warn Americans to be on the lookout -- be on the lookout -- for anyone who looks suspicious. And today, they got over 300 phone calls about Matt Lauer's new haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad news -- 40 Al Qaeda terrorists headed towards Los Angeles. The good news -- they're stuck on the Ventura Freeway. They won't be here until 2010.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokesman for our Governor, Gray 'The Sky Is Falling' Davis, announced today a terrorist attack is inevitable in California. You know, they can't promise electricity or anything, but they can promise - 'A terrorist attack, yes, I can promise you that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, okay? I am not gonna panic until I see Martha Stewart dumping her Triple A California tax-free bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush called the US soccer team Sunday before their win against Mexico. He told the team he was rooting for them, even though he knows nothing about soccer. He's very honest. When that phone call was over, he called Ariel Sharon and told him he was rooting for him, even though he knows nothing about the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, President Bush announced he's relaxing the clean air standards. I guess choking once wasn't enough for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a scary moment in Washington yesterday. I'm sure you all heard about this. They had to evacuate the entire White House after a plane flew too low over restricted air space. Hear about this? Turns out it was a false alarm, luckily. Seems it was just a Southwest Airlines flight who couldn't gain altitude because of all the overweight passengers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Southwest Airlines announced it will start double charging anyone they feel is too large to fit in one of their seats. If they think you're overweight, you have to buy two tickets. That why I love all this. The guy in a turban can walk by security with a fuse in his shoe, but God forbid you got an overweight guy - 'Hey, chubby, come back here! Come on. Security!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the House passed a preliminary bill that will allow pilots -- allow pilots to carry guns in the cockpit. And today, Southwest Airlines pilots said, because of all the heavyset passengers, they need elephant guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A village in India today married two donkeys in a ceremony designed to appease the rain gods. In India, they dressed up two donkeys as a bride and groom and had a wedding for them to make it rain. These are the same people that now have nuclear weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 10 million people voted, and purple is the new M&amp;M color. Here's the embarrassing part, Al Gore finished second again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Jesse Ventura told Minnesota Public Radio he won't run for reelection because his heart is no longer in politics. That's what he said. Yeah, and apparently when he heard this, Dick Cheney said, 'Big deal. My heart's barely in my chest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, an airplane flew into restricted airspace over Washington, and they had to evacuate the White House. You know, I know you folks know all about this, I'm just letting the FBI know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it had a happy ending. It was just a mix-up. The plane was full of fat people who couldn't get a seat on Southwest Airlines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Southwest Airlines is now charging people who are overweight, you know, hefties, obese, fat people? It seemed like discrimination to me, but they're charging these people now, if they want to fly, they're charging you for the price of two seats. And I'm thinking to myself, 'Boy things just keep going from bad to worse for Al Gore, don't they?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In soccer, you can use your head, and you can use your feet, but you're not allowed to use your hands. And coincidentally, that's President Clinton's technical definition of sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turning now to the legal plight of Zacarias Moussaoui, September 11th's alleged twentieth hijacker. The US legal system offers extensive protection for those accused of crimes. The right to not incriminate themselves. The right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. And if that attorney is, in your eyes, a 'nasty Jewish zealot' and a 'right-wing racist bloodsucker,' you can defend yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moussaoui was subdued, explaining, quote: 'My life is at risk and I will never compromise it. My life is very precious to me, it is given by God, and I will not play with it.' Adding, 'your life...now, that's another subject altogether.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the hearing, Moussaoui's mother sat in the second row, experiencing a complex mix of emotions, ranging from horror at what her son is accused of and sadness at his current plight, to pride that she can now refer to him as, 'my son, the lawyer.' and he's 'single.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm sure you've heard by now they're reports that 40 members of the Al Qaeda are headed for Los Angeles. Actually, only two of them are terrorists. The other 38 want to direct. They have a screenplay or something like that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, the FBI said terrorists may try to hijack a gasoline tanker truck and they'd be planning to steal it from one of the other terrorists -- you know, the oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Las Vegas, a man apparently overheard a conversation on a cell phone between people speaking in Arabic, talking about a possible attack on Las Vegas. . But the good news -- the attackers said they're going to Vegas by boat. I don't think they're the brightest people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think these terrorists might be posing as developers in Las Vegas trying to put up a new hotel -- the Al Kaboom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has ruled that it is illegal to execute the mentally retarded. Finally some good news for Forest Service workers who start fires by burning letters from ex-husbands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying that President Bush was completely unaware that the White House was evacuated Wednesday night when that plane flew over restricted air space. Bush, unaware -- who's gonna believe that? See, didn't you think he'd go, 'Hello, hello! Where is everybody?' They're rushing Cheney out the door. 'George, you just sit there. Cheney, get in the plane.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the official first day of summer. And in Washington, Attorney General John Ashcroft let naked statues wear tank tops and shorts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A couple of days ago President Bush called the US soccer team to congratulate them on beating Mexico. And today after they lost by just one point, Al Gore called to congratulate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big day for President Bush. He is unveiling details of his home security plan. And I'm thinking to myself, now, wait a minute, what's wrong with this? How good is your security plan if you're announcing the details? Is that really what you want to be doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's something good. The Bush Administration is encouraging everybody to get in shape, and they have a big exercise program and everybody in the White House is working out and they're really stressing they're trying. . So it's interesting because now when a White House intern does a lap she's probably swimming. That's the difference now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems NASA scientists say an asteroid the size of a football field just missed the earth last week. It passed within 75,000 miles of the earth, which is very close. And here's the scary part -- listen to this -- turns out, we don't even have collision insurance. All we have is liability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 40 members of the Al Qaeda are allegedly heading towards Los Angeles. They say they're going to try and fit in like typical immigrants. I saw one today at the end of the freeway off-ramp. He was selling big bags of hand grenades. See, $1 -- $1. Big bags of hand grenades for $1.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crew of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile -- you ever seen that thing? That hot dog driving around? They were questioned by police after the Wienermobile accidentally strayed onto an access road next to the Pentagon. Even though it seems harmless, authorities were concerned about the Wienermobile because let's face it, nobody real knows what's in a hot dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he was not worried about that plane that accidentally entered into the White House air space last week. He said the guy was obviously confused. The man was disoriented and somehow just found himself at the White House. Just like Bush. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, President Bush kicked off his new program promoting physical fitness. Bush participated in a three-mile run with several hundred White House workers over the weekend. Bush finished 26th out of 400 runners. That's pretty good. Well, after a quick recount by some Florida officials -- he won. He actually won the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report just released -- listen to this. Last year Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld sold up to $91 million in stock. I didn't even know he knew Martha Stewart. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart is in trouble because she sold some stock in December the day before the stock completely collapsed. She's being accused of insider trading. You know what that is? That's where you know something before it happens. See, if she knows stuff before it happens, forget jail -- let's make this woman head of the FBI.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that Hillary Clinton has finished her book, while Bill hasn't even started his. Her book is finished. Which makes sense -- see, with hers done first, it makes it easier for them to get their stories straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How bizarre is this -- Michael Jackson was apparently spotted flying on the Concorde from London, wearing a fuchsia face mask, accompanied by a puppet in the next seat named Pinocchio. To give an idea how creepy this guy is, three terrorists got off the plane. &quot;We don't want to fly with him. We don't want to fly with him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something alarming. They say now that Osama bin Laden, you remember Osama bin Laden? They say they found the guy and he's still alive and planning more attacks. The question I have is, do you want to tell the FBI, or should I? How do we handle this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Clinton, how many remember President Bill Clinton? He got a brand new dog, you know he loves dogs and he got a brand new dog. They had a confusing thing over the weekend, Hillary is in the house and she hears Bill talking to the dog and she don't know the dog is in there. And Bill is saying 'Beg, roll over fetch, sit up.' And for a second, she thought he was dating again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bill Clinton is busy. Over the weekend, he was up at the Mohegan Sun Casino, they opened a new hotel and he was up there playing saxophone. Hard to believe, this guy has left office and has actually become less classy. Isn't it interesting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Mohegan Sun Hotel Casino, man, what a happening place that is, and Native Americans own the hotel and casino, and it's a big business, they make like a billion dollars a year. And the coincidence about this is, Clinton at one time had an intern who was a Native American, it is true. I believe her name was 'Kneeling Fox.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court voted 6-3 Thursday that states may not execute the mentally retarded. The ruling represents a major victory for anti-death penalty forces and supporters of the rights of mentally disabled inmates, but comes as a severe blow to supporters of... executing retards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ruling means that those charged with murder will not face a death sentence if they can prove they are mentally retarded, and that it is up to the states to legally define that standard. That's a change from the current system of determining if someone or something is retarded by asking a group of 12 year-old boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some 82% of the American people oppose the execution of the mentally retarded, so we are very pleased. Additionally, 27% had no objection while the remaining 15% were undecided. These figures were brought to you by the national association of retarded mathematicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, as I mentioned at the top, the court's vote was 6-3. Dissenters included Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and, therefore, Clarence Thomas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scalia was so angry that he read his dissent from the bench, stating the decision does not reflect the opinion of the majority of Americans, that the court simply imposed its will on the nation, and that, quote: 'The arrogance of this assumption of power takes one's breath away.' Adding, 'The President we installed in the White House has got to be livid!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rival groups of Protestants and Catholics clashed on the streets of Belfast in Ireland the other night. Apparently they're jealous of the attention that the Middle East is getting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A heavily-guarded shipment of plutonium -- six tons to be exact -- of plutonium is being shipped across the country right now from Colorado to South Carolina. They actually show in USA Today, this is unbelievable - the actual map of the route the truck is taking! Why don't we just tell the terrorists, 'We're going to leave the keys under the visor when we go to the Jack in the Box!' What are we, idiots?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amtrak now threatening to shut down this week if they don't get a $200 million bailout from the government. In fact, to save money, they've already scaled basic services. They're going from three derailments a week now, to just one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura says he is dropping out of politics. Yeah. He said his heart's not in it anymore. Hey, never stopped Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced this week his gonna give the Presidential Medal of Freedom award to Mr. Rogers. President Bush said today, Mr. Rogers' TV show is so much less confusing to watch than all those stupid Sunday morning shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, President Bush participated in a three-mile race, along with 400 other White House staffers. He came in 26th -- came in 26th out of 400. I'm sure the guy who came in 27th wasn't exactly lunging at the tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton has finished her memoirs for release early next year. Although Bill, Bill has barely finished the first chapter of his. But to be fair, fiction is a lot harder to write.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, President Clinton gave the commencement speech at a New York City high school. And afterwards, he showed some of the female graduates other fun ways they could wear their tassels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three top aides to Gary Condit -- y'all remember Gary. It seems his three top aides got huge, double, triple salary increases in the days following the revelations that he was involved with Chandra Levy. Oh, duh. What better time to ask your boss for a raise?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A San Diego electronics company has come out with a new weapon, a weapon that uses the sound of a crying baby blasted at 140 decibels to incapacitate enemy soldiers. You know, I think they've been testing this weapon on every flight I've been on in the last ten years, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way it works is, the device directs sound waves -- sound waves which are called sonic bullets. They aim them at the enemy and they're very effective against opponents, unless of course, your opponent is firing real bullets. Then you're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, before I came out here, I received a phone call from Martha Stewart. She asked me if I would make an announcement for Martha. She wants all of her stockholders to know that those stock certificates can be made into lovely placemats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about George Bush now, he's the physical fitness President, George Bush. He's trying to make sure everybody in the US gets in the top physical condition of their life. They are having physical fitness at the White House month. This guy can bench press 185 pounds. That's right. Let me put that in perspective for you, in the Clinton Administration...that would be half an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart said that the insider trading charges against her are ridiculous, and that she will be cleared at any moment. That was her statement. Yeah, when asked how she could be so sure, Martha said, 'I have inside information.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday was an historic day in the annals of Middle East peace, as President Bush delivered his long-awaited manifesto on the future of the troubled region. . So it's very simple: All you need to do is put in new leaders, new institutions, and new security, and then you'll have you're own state. Provisionally. After talks. Other restrictions may apply. May not be available in your area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Genuine change was at the core of the President's demands, starting at the top, with Bush stating, quote: 'The Palestinian state will never be created by terror; it will be built through reform. And reform must be more than cosmetic change.' That last sentence, of course, a clear reference to the recent nomination of 'Yassira Arafatwa' for new Palestinian chairwoman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Bush did not mention Arafat by name once during his speech, a tactic that backfired after Bush called for the Palestinian leader's removal, and Arafat was overheard telling an advisor, 'I'd hate to be 'that' guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Energy Department has &quot;created a massive rift between the Federal Government and the state of South Carolina. DOE officials plan to ship plutonium waste from a weapons facility in Colorado to South Carolina's Savannah River nuclear power plant for reprocessing. South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges initially pledged to block the plutonium-carrying trucks by lying down in the middle of the road, which in South Carolina, means Wade, the town drunk, will have to move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One issue Hodges won't have to worry about is security. Federal agents traveling with the tractor rigs will be authorized to use 'deadly force' to protect the plutonium shipments. And if anyone attacks the vehicles, they will counterattack using as a weapon the very effective 'truck full of plutonium.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we were going to start the program with the Pledge of Allegiance, but I don't want to go to jail, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The California appeals court has ruled that reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in school is unconstitutional now--because it has the phrase, 'one nation under God,' in it. That's what I love about California. The only time you can mention God in school now is, apparently, when you're having sex with a teacher.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, this is a huge issue now--with all the terrorism, now this is what we have to deal with. They said it violates the separation of church and state. You know, how about the separation of church and altar boy? I'm more concerned about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, before we go any further, I've been asked to make an announcement. The WorldCom July 4th picnic has been canceled. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable. Telecommunications giant, WorldCom, admitted yesterday it overestimated earnings over the past four years by $3.8 billion--not million, billion! First Enron, then Tyco, now WorldCom. How come all these companies are off billions in their accounting and nothing happens? You bounce a $15 check at the Quickmart--'Hey! Hey!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And their accounting firm is Arthur Andersen, by the way. Duh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what the accountant said today--'A bookkeeping irregularity is responsible for the $3.8 billion mistake.' Oh, ah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing WorldCom did after discovering this almost $4 billion loss was to fire 17,000 lower-level employees. Oh, yeah. Like it is the janitor's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie in the country, 'Minority Report,' starring Tom Cruise. It's good. It's interesting. It takes place 50 years in the future. And it's about three people with psychic abilities so strong, they can actually predict crimes before they happen. This is pretty amazing. Because right now the FBI, they can't even predict crimes after they happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great movie, and very timely, too. There's one scene where Tom Cruise comes out of nowhere and arrests Martha Stewart for an illegal trade she's gonna make next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a little tip from the Martha Stewart fashion division. This fall, prison stripes may be in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if she doesn't have enough problems, now it seems Martha Stewart has been romantically linked to former ImClone chief, Sam Waksal, whom she met while he was dating her daughter. You following me here? She's goin' out with a guy who was dating her daughter. What happened to Martha? She has gone from gracious living to trailer park living. What happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House T-ball game this past Sunday, one kid hit a homerun. You know what that means--steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In yesterday's speech, President Bush said that in the Middle East-- listen to this--they have to put armed guards in the kindergarten classrooms to protect the children. I guess priests are a problem over there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Canada right now attending one of those G-8 summit meetings in Alberta in a town called Kananaskis. Everyone is excited waiting for President Bush to try and pronounce it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was kind of a breakthrough. Yasser Arafat says he likes George W. Bush's idea of a brand new Palestinian election as long as they count the ballots in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Stewart has &quot;her chin up. Great attitude. I saw her in the hallway today showing people how to turn Federal subpoenas into party hats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that the FBI is visiting libraries nationwide and checking the reading records of people it finds suspicious. That's what they're doing now. Yeah, when asked about it, President Bush said, 'I've always been suspicious of people who go to libraries.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The G8 Summit: The annual meeting where the eight leaders of the world's industrial powers get together to chat and exchange ideas, while the little people outside scream helplessly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year it's off to the secret mountain lair...more specifically, the delta lodge resort in Kananaskis, Alberta, a wilderness region of snowcapped mountains, dense forest and secluded waterways, chosen so business can be conducted without those pesky activists. In fact, only one incident has occurred so far, when President Bush was caught after-hours trying to drill for oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reports of the massive accounting error&quot; at WorldCom &quot;sent the Dow Jones plummeting today, as investor confidence was yet again shaken by the shady practices of big business. With the market losing billions, now might be a good time to buy Ramen noodles. They are cheap and fill you up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WorldCom, in conjunction with the Arthur Andersen crime family -- you know this story -- have defrauded investors out of $3.8, $3.9 billion. See, the way they got away with it for so long, they made their financial statements look like the cell phone bills and nobody could figure it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the nation's sixth-largest cable company, Adelphia Cable -- they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week. A bankrupt cable company -- how long does it take them to answer the phone now?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The spokesman for the company says the earliest they could be out of business would be sometime on Friday between 9:00 and 5:00. They're not really sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a stunning court ruling here in California -- this has just got people outraged if you listen to the radio. Today, the Constitution was ruled unconstitutional!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a Federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the Pledge of Allegiance is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion and cannot be recited in school. I bet a lot of people said 'Amen' to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, boy, I tell you -- this judge is very tough. Today, he ruled against mom, the flag, and apple pie. Those are out!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this is the only country in the world where you can legally burn the flag, but God bless you, try to salute it. You're going to jail, buddy. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, this has been a tough time for God, hasn't it? First the Catholic Church thing, now he gets kicked out of school. This guy's got nothing but problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the courts figured they weren't having any luck bending alcohol, drugs and sex, so let's kick God out. We know we can get rid of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was furious today. Man, he was really upset. He said today, if they're going to cut God out of the Pledge of Allegiance, they should cut the part out about witches, too. You know that - 'for witches stands.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI still investigating who's responsible for that string of anthrax mailings last year. They say the person who did it -- they put together a profile -- the person who did it most likely made the anthrax himself, very meticulous, good with their hands, and not very well-liked. It's Martha Stewart. Oh, my gosh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten Enron women have posed naked for this month's Playboy. It comes out tomorrow. They refused to say how much they were paid. I love that, they pose like this - 'And how much did you get paid?&quot;I'm sorry. Certain things are private.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A spokeswomen for supermodel Naomi Campbell -- you know, she's been here. Beautiful Naomi Campbell -- has publicly denied that s is dating Bill Clinton.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, there will be no Pledge of Allegiance, I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy. The Enron scandal, then the ImClone scandal, now the WorldCom scandal. It's gotten so bad, earlier today, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza held a press conference to say he's not a accountant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Canada at the big G-8 summit, the Group of 8, big economic summit in Canada. And you wonder about President Bush. Times like this, I'm thinking to myself, 'Is he taking this as serious as he should? I heard every time somebody says G-8, the President yells 'Bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush right now is in Canada. I don't know if you even knew that. He's having a very good meeting with other world leaders at the G-8 economic summit. That's what he's up to, which is a good thing. Yeah. Working stuff out, doing the people's work. Yeah, apparently, there was one awkward moment, though, when someone said, 'G-8,' and Bush jumped up and yelled, 'Bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This month's Playboy magazine features a naked pictorial of the women of Enron. It's true. Yeah, after viewing the pictures, just hope there's never ever a scandal at '60 Minutes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that executives from WorldCom -- that's the company that owns MCI --.these executives could face prison time for the latest accounting scandal there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a reporter asked Attorney General John Ashcroft how he feels about the ruling. And he said he couldn't comment because, as you know, he hasn't read the Constitution yet.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we are no longer allowed to say, 'One nation under God.' Today, God said, 'Hey, with all the sex, violence and greed in the news, I'm taking my name off the project anyway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call me cynical, but my favorite part of this whole thing -- did you see all the congressmen on the news the other day out on the Capitol steps holding their hearts, saying the pledge of allegiance right in front of the TV cameras?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, you know, this ruling means now the OJ jurors are off the hook. They are now only the second biggest morons in the history of the California court system.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush scheduled to under go a.colonoscopy, tomorrow. You never know where that Osama bin Laden might be hiding. Hey, and if he's gonna be anywhere, that's where he's is, believe me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's pretty easy for the anesthesiologist to put Bush under. They're just gonna slip him a pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, reporters asked President Bush, 'Do you know what the polyp is?' And he said, 'Well, sure, he saw that &quot;Apollo 13&quot; movie, and &quot;Polyp 11&quot; went to the moon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Amtrak may be shutting down, which of course, would hurt a lot of businesses. You know, the ambulance business, the trauma business, the salvage crane business. Those will all be seriously hurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amtrak has &quot;24,000 workers and they transport 60,000 passengers a day. That's one worker for every three passengers. Wouldn't it be cheaper for Amtrak workers just to drive these people to work in their own cars?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Flying is a nightmare now. I was on a flight over the weekend. It was unbelievable. There were these two obnoxious drunks in the front of me. Loud, boisterous, I hate it when America West leaves the cockpit door open.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two America West pilots were stopped by airport screeners for being drunk. The pilots were drunk. And of course, people were shocked. 'What, airport screeners actually caught somebody? How does that happen? What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But their blood alcohol level, five times the legal limit. Here's my question -- why is there even a legal limit for pilots? Shouldn't it be zero?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when you think about it, these are the same guys who say they now need guns in the cockpit. There's a good combination, drunks with guns flying the planes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why we have to have locks upon the cockpit doors, to keep the pilots from gettin' at the beverage carts. See, it's to keep them from getting out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new FBI statistic released today, for the first time in nine years, street crime is up in America. Actually just one street, Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, earlier today, President Bush held a surprise press conference about the economy. He said, 'sell!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, India is expected to choose as their new president the man who created their nuclear missile system. What better way to show the world you're for peace, than to elect as president the guy who invent your atomic bomb?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's the difference between India and America, right there. Here in America, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good medical news for President Bush, had his physical, tip-top condition he's in. Doctors found no polyps on the President's colon during his colon exam. However, they did find five extra votes for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is out there hitting the campaign trail, and not a minute too soon. Al Gore's been criticizing President Bush because we haven't yet found Osama bin Laden. Bin laden? We can't even figure out what Martha Stewart is doing, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news today for Martha. Now Kmart is worried she's hurting their good name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge story, a California judge has ruled the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional. This is being called the worst decision in California since Robert Blake's wife said, 'Honey, I don't feel like cooking. Why don't we go out?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a Federal judge has ruled that sodomy is legal in Arkansas. So Bill Clinton, you can go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think I'm whining. Here's how hot it is. Today, Martha Stewart was using her stock certificates as dress shields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know they're doing this like extended Nightline thing, and Ted Koppel was nice enough to invite me on the show and I'll be over there a little later. But something weird, he insisted on putting me up on with a split screen with Yasser Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, a couple days ago, had one of those colonoscopy things. Good idea. And he's fine, everything turned out great, but during the examination they found 300 Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. What was it, 103, 104 today? Man, I tell you, I was sweating like an America West pilot taking a breathalyzer test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, last week two America West pilots, or America Wild West pilots, they call them now, were arrested for operating a jet airliner while drunk. The licenses were suspended. They were fired by the airline. Now they face criminal charges. But the good news, apparently there are jobs waiting for them at Amtrak.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a hunch something was wrong. You know? I flew America West a couple weeks ago. About ten minutes into the flight the pilot was on the intercom, he said 'This is your pilot speaking, my name is Bob, and I'm an alcoholic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wouldn't have even have caught these two pilots if they hadn't have seen them going around and around on the baggage carousel. That's when they knew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was on Wall Street today giving a speech on corporate responsibility. He called for the doubling of the maximum sentences for white collar crime. So now the judge will slap you on both wrists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Senate is expected to pass new laws designed to crack down on these corporate executives that cook the books. You know, instead of writing new laws, why don't we just enforce the ones we already have? Anybody think of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why aren't we giving these guys a chance to explain to their new cellmate, Bubba, what happened to the billion dollars. Then it will work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, you see all these companies now, you got ImClone, they're a bunch of crooks, Global Crossing, more crooks. Exxon, Xerox, they're all nuts. WorldCom, now this newest one, Merck, the pharmacists. Do you realize the most honest companies we have in America, tobacco and oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers appeared before a House panel examining the accounting irregularities. You see, when we make a mistake on $80 on our income taxes, we're crooks. $4 billion, it's an accounting irregularity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times reporting today that President Bush now has a formal plan to invade Iraq. They say the key to this plan -- timing. The article says the attack will begin the minute Bush's popularity falls below 52%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of this talk about India and nuclear weapons this week has been very confusing for Senator Strom Thurmond. You know, 100-year-old Senator Strom Thurmond. In fact, when he heard the Indians have a nuclear bomb he said, 'My God, does Custer know about this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I liked this story last week, a couple of pilots for America West were arrested for flying a plane drunk. And I thought that's pretty good. Remember the old days when the only people drunk at the airport were the security screeners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard this rumor that the Al Qaeda is merging with the Hamas. I got that tip from Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always a big time when President Bush is in the city. He was in New York City this afternoon. He was down on Wall Street, and he was giving a speech, imploring people to crack down on accounting fraud, lashing out, attacking accounting fraud. I'm thinking wait a minute, accounting fraud. Isn't that how he got elected?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, &quot;Martha Stewart.plans to set up an attractively appointed house in a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, &quot;Saddam Hussein is going to enjoy his last summer on earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney plans to get a sunburn in an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech on Wall Street today, President Bush spoke out against corporate irresponsibility. And he warned executives not to cook the books. That's what he said. He said, 'Do not cook the books.' After hearing this, Martha Stewart said, 'Actually, the correct term is 'saute' the books.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's 70th birthday. Yeah, apparently, Rumsfeld's birthday party came as a complete surprise to both the FBI and the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems today for America West airlines. Did you hear about this? It seems one of their jets had to make an emergency landing when the pilot discovered they were out of Jell-o shots.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the two pilots that were drunk? They released the names of the pilots. I believe Captain Jack Daniels and co-pilot Jim Beam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he's ready to send corporate CEO's to prison, and he means tough prisons. You know, the ones that only have the nine-hole golf courses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are looking pretty bad for Martha Stewart. She canceled her appearance on the CBS Early Show this week, reportedly because she's trying to stay out of the limelight. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. If she wants to avoid the limelight, what better place to be than the CBS Early Show?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a mix-up in a British fertility clinic, black twins were accidentally born to white parents after some sperm from a black male was implanted in this woman's egg by mistake, or at least that's the story she told her husband. Better hope that kid doesn't look like Jesse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Seattle company has been given $600,000 by NASA, you know, the space agency, to look into the possibility of building an elevator that goes into space.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to George W. Bush. Earlier today, the Supreme Court declared him the winner of last night's All-Star game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in town yesterday and calling for legislation to crack down on corporate crime. He's creating a corporate SWAT team. It's a financial SWAT team. That's what he wants. He wants to create a financial SWAT team, but CBS has a show about a financial SWAT team. It's called Starsky and Rukeyser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said we were going after white collared criminals, and I was thinking, 'Gee, I wish the Catholic Church would do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI admitted that the 19 hijackers.were able to come to this country, open up 35 bank accounts containing hundreds of thousands of dollars without having Social Security numbers, proper IDs, or background checks. See, this is what's amazing about our country. You're a known terrorist. You're on an expired student visa. You can move around millions of dollars in a fake bank account. Nobody notices. But go Blockbuster, try to rent a DVD without two pieces of ID - 'Hey -- hey!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives today passed a bill allowing pilots to carry guns in the cockpits. How 'bout that? What a good idea. Oh, great idea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress voted to allow pilots to carry guns on airplanes. The airlines are very excited about this. In fact, on my way to work today I saw two America West pilots shooting beer cans off each other's heads.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, more problems for the White House. It seems a video has surfaced showing Dick Cheney endorsing what a great job the accountants at the Arthur Andersen crime family have been doing. Which means now R. Kelly has only the second-most embarrassing videotape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like WorldCom's going to file for bankruptcy, they say, in the next couple of weeks, making it the largest bankruptcy in America's history. First Enron, WorldCom, ImClone, Merck. You know, Bush said he was going to dry up Al Qaeda's assets, not our assets. What happened? They seem to have plenty of dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I can say is I.F. Normally I'd say T.G.I.F., but in California now, that's unconstitutional. Just have to say I.F., you don't want to get arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress passed legislation, and now commercial airline pilots will be able to carry guns. But for safety, for safety, they must keep them locked up in the cockpit liquor cabinet. Always keep them there for safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Friday, July 12. It may not mean anything to you, but traditionally this is the beginning of the Labor Day weekend for Mayor Bloomberg. He's gone now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, big doings down in Miami, Florida. Former Attorney General Janet Reno is hosting a dance party at a Miami nightclub. . Not only is she the guest of honor, she's also the bouncer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rap music now being recorded by Arabs. Uh-huh, Arab rappers. You know, I would hate to see this lead to violence in the Middle East. That would be terrible if that would happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, there is going to be a new show, it's a new dating show where one guy dates 50 girls in 50 states, or, as Bill Clinton calls it, reality TV, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, folks, if you're worried about your money in the stock market, stop worrying. It's gone! It's not coming back! You're screwed! So don't even worry about it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today the nation's economy is suffering from a hangover from the economic binge of the '90s. Believe me, if anybody knows about hangovers it's George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember that economic binge of the '90s? What a nightmare that was. Soaring stock market, no inflation, low interest rates, high surpluses. Everybody had a job. What were we thinking? We must have been nuts back then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story today, American Taliban John Walker Lindh surprised the courtroom when he pleaded guilty. The kid pled guilty, and his lawyers are very upset. They could lose a lot money on this. They were hoping for a long trial. In fact, today, they called the kid a traitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Lindh was sentenced to two 10-year terms, 20 years in prison. He only asked for one condition -- he wants to be allowed to serve his sentence at Allen Iverson's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reports that PLO leader Yasser Arafat, you know, Osama bin Laden's 'Mini-Me'.has illegally transferred millions -- millions of dollars from the PLO, that was donated to the Palestinian people into his own personal bank account.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the world coming to when you can't trust a known terrorist?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the government, 5,000 Americans may have Al Qaeda ties. And they say as many as 3,500 may also have the matching sports jacket and slacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that the polio virus, which has all but been eradicated, really.has now been made completely from scratch. God, that Martha Stewart is unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's rumors now that Osama bin Laden is still alive and he's hiding a long the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the mountains some place.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dow made history today. For the first time ever, the Dow is now lower than Dick Cheney's cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things do not look good. Let's see what we got. The economy's gone south. People are out of work. We're at war. In fact, George Bush Sr. woke up this morning, read the paper and thought, 'Hey, I must still be President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That American Taliban kid, John Walker Lindh, you always have three names when you do something bad in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has pleaded guilty to two counts of terrorism. Has agreed to a 20- year prison sentence. Apparently his jihad has been put on 'jihold' right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 20-year prison sentence. I mean, so what? If he hadn't been captured, he'd be facing, what, 20 years in a cave. I think he got the better deal, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man who tried to assassinate the President of France on Sunday was described as an emotionally disturbed, neo-Nazi skinhead. As opposed to all the clear-thinking, rational neo-Nazis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of France has a lot of enemies who belong to far right extremist groups, unlike our President who just appoints them to his Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems today for America West. It seems a passenger on one of the America West flights asked the crew, 'Hey, has the pilot been drinking?' And the crew, pretty short temper. They didn't think the comment was funny. They threw her off the plane. Isn't that something? Yeah. So not only are they drunks, they're mean drunks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today that Martha Stewart was actually happy to be under a cloud of suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy's in trouble. And yesterday, in a really big speech, President Bush said the economy was still getting over 'the hangover from the '90s.' That's what he said, and then the President admitted he's still getting over his hangover from the '80s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno's campaign for the governorship of Florida is running seriously low on cash. She's running out of money. Yeah, apparently it was a really bad decision to raise money by selling those Janet Reno swimsuit calendars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported that a student at the University of Delaware broke into the computer system and changed her grades from 'Fs' to 'As.' Changed her grades. 'Fs' to 'As.' Yeah, as a result, the student has been hired to run WorldCom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alan Greenspan, God bless him. He spoke yesterday. He said the economy is continuing to build momentum. Well, see, that's what happens when everything's going downhill. You build momentum.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I tell you something, a lot of people are dumping on President Bush, and I think he deserves some praise. Well, think about it. On his watch, we've had a war, terrorists are everywhere, the stock market is collapsing. Questions have risen about his and Dick Cheney's former business practices. Yet, he hasn't started drinking again. We have, but he hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in exchange for his 20-year prison sentence, American Taliban John Walker Lindh says he's gonna cooperate fully with our government. He's gonna admit guilt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration just introduced new proposals aimed at making it more difficult for Middle East terrorists to get drivers licenses. Hey, forget that. You see the way Americans drive? They're on the cell phone, they're eating food. They're putting on makeup. Let's make it more difficult for Americans to get drivers licenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein has vow to defeat the US in war. Ooh! He said his troops will never surrender -- unless of course they're attacked. Then they may do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen this? The media tries to scare us with this stupid stock footage they keep running on the news. It's allegedly from one of the Al Qaeda terrorist training camps. The clip shows the terrorists and hoods running through the obstacle course. You've seen it. They keep running this over and over. I mean, is that supposed to scare us? Look at that. Ooh, ooh, they've got jungle gyms. Ooh! We're frightened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess you heard, Yasser Arafat, Osama's 'Mini-Me,' has allegedly been stashing away millions of dollars in secret bank accounts, money that was supposedly intended for the Palestinian people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wacky Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who has been convicted of bribery, extortion, a number of other things. He's in front of the Ethics Committee this week.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of funny, I bumped into my stock broker today on my way to work. Well, actually I didn't bump into him, I broke his fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about the new fall season upcoming on CBS, and they have got some amazing shows.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then they're also developing a show, right here, a two-part mini- series on CBS about young Hitler. I believe it's called, 'Adolph in the Middle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Stewart is &quot;keeping her chin up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are getting kinda tough for President Bush right now. It was reported today -- a true story -- that President Bush's approval ratings are dropping fast.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Zacarias Moussaoui guy, the 20th hijacker, he attempted to plead guilty today. He said, 'I'm guilty. I plead guilty. I'm a terrorist. I plead guilty.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point, Moussaoui said in court, he said, 'I pledge allegiance to Osama bin Laden.' He actually said that. You know, it's a good thing he didn't pledge allegiance and say 'under God,' he could have really been screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like another Pentagon scandal brewing. Listen to this. I love these kind of scandals. It seems at least 200 Army personnel have been caught using government credit cards to pay for lap dances at local strip clubs. They spent $38,000 on lap dances. You know, that's the same the Pentagon has spent on toilet seats and screwdrivers. That's why the $38,000 wasn't on one lap dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Financial analysts said today we're entering a new chapter in the stock market. Chapter 11, I believe it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission will be investigating Vice President Dick Cheney. That's right. And it will begin the investigation just as soon as Congress is done investigating the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. So...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of CEOs have taken their money out of the stock market and are putting it into bonds. You know, bail bonds. 'Cause that's where they're going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But help is on the way, folks. Earlier this week, the Senate voted 97 to zero for tougher regulation of corporate America and the accounting industry. Tough new rules. Like, for example, when corporations now buy a senator they have to get a receipt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in a Virginia courtroom this terrorist suspect, Zacarias Moussaoui, the man known as the 20th hijacker, tried to plead guilty to all the charges against him but the judge refused to accept the plea. The judge told him, 'Look, don't rush into this, take a week, think about it, you might want to change your mind.' Nice to see we're getting tough on terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only that, listen to this, the guy admitted -- he said, 'Look, I don't want to go through this, I did it.' He also admitted to being a member of the Al- Qaeda, he pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden and said, 'Look, I'm part of the conspiracy.' Or as the judge called it, circumstantial evidence. That doesn't mean anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republicans announced this week they may go to Florida for the 2004 presidential convention. Yeah, yeah. Proving once again they always return to the scene of the crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like some 200 Army personnel are in trouble, seems they used government charge cards to get $38,000 worth of lap dances at strip clubs. Or as the Army is calling it, 'Operation Throbbing Freedom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the president of CBS announced that 'Survivor 5' will premiere this September. This is going to be one of the most challenging ones yet. The 16 contestants have to survive for 39 days on what's left of their 401K plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted Williams &quot;didn't want to be frozen. He wanted to be cremated and scattered off the coast of Florida. Coincidentally that's what they did with all the Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a spokesman for Al Qaeda issued a statement calling for the destruction of America. Let me tell you something. I got news for these people, okay? They cannot destroy the American way of life. Only Wall Street can do that. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was the market -- under 8000 today? Corporations are collapsing. People are losing their life's savings. No end in sight.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest issue of Newsweek magazine says that President Bush is determined not to make the same mistakes his father did. You know, like lettin' his kids get involved in politics, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Bush announced today he will spend a month away from the White House. He'll be gone from August 6th through Labor Day. Apparently, his parents are dropping him off at summer camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this unbelievable? Congress just voted to give themselves a pay raise. Another pay raise. This is their fourth pay raise in four years. Anybody here had a pay raise every year? No. And yesterday, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, he defended the congressional pay raise. He said Congress works hard. And all of that hard work has certainly paid off, huh? Yeah. Let's recognize a job well done. We are at war. Terrorists all over the place. Wall Street's collapsing. People are out of work. Retirement funds are gone. Imagine if they hadn't goofed off. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On one hand, Congress does need this pay raise, you know, since those Enron checks dried up. You know, those are gone now, so they don't have that coming in anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a better idea. Instead of a salary, let's put Congress on commission. They don't get paid unless they do something right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 20th hijacker, that Zacarias Moussaoui guy, he pled guilty. Last week, he said, 'Look, I did it. I'm in the Al Qaeda. I pledge my allegiance.' He pled guilty. The judge refused the plea. She tells him, 'Look, take a week. Think about it. Give yourself some time. Don't rush into this decision.' They also told bin Laden, 'Look, take your time with the next video, we'd like to see a better story, more music.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Moussaoui is actually a French citizen? Yeah. So not only is he a terrorist, he's rude, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, in Miami, those two pinhead America West pilots -- the ones who were charged with trying to fly their plane while legally drunk. They're both drunk. They failed to show up at the arraignment hearing. Didn't show up. Apparently, it was scheduled during happy hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey, Germans are the best behaved tourists in the world. See, it's only when they march into your country and want to stay forever, that's when it gets a little testy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore sounds like he's running again, he's accusing the Bush Administration of lying about the economy, that's what he said. They're lying about the economy. Al Gore, pretty strong words from the guy who invented the Internet, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The power failure&quot; over the weekend &quot;didn't just affect New York City, it went way up into the suburbs. In fact, Chappaqua, where former President Clinton lives, they had a power outage there, in fact it was bad, he had to use a manual intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strip club revelations are just part of a much larger investigation into why military [credit] cards were used to purchase electronics, cigars, fine wine, vacation cruises, and even two pictures of Elvis from the Graceland gift shop.

Thank you for calling the American people. We're sorry, but all of our American people are currently assisting other scandals. Please hold.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bar tab is in for those two drunken America West pilots. It was made public yesterday. You know, I just thought, 'Oh, they had a couple of drinks and they got caught.' Listen to this. This is true. They started drinking at 10:49 PM, they drank until 4:22 in the morning. They had seven 34-ounce beers. Seven 16-ounce beers, a regular sized beer, one martini and a hamburger. Well, a hamburger. You don't want to drink on an empty stomach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing to me? Only one of the pilots had a martini. What was the other pilot thinking? 'Martini, bob?&quot;Oh, no, not before flying. I'll just have another gallon of beer.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another bad day on Wall Street, boy, it is getting pretty ugly. The Dow Jones is starting to look like Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are so bad, today at Merrill Lynch, they lynched Merrill. That's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how bad the economy is. In New York City, Donald Trump today unveiled his newest project, Trump Trailer Park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and how scary is this? This is pretty frightening. In Texas, the Air Force accidentally dropped a dummy bomb on a house, crashed through the bathroom roof, went right down the toilet. Oh, that's WorldCom stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, WorldCom, the parent company of MCI, has declared bankruptcy. They admitted to almost $4 billion in accounting errors. Did you see that? Even the phone company can't figure out their phone bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is really sad. Like today, telemarketers from MCI were actually calling people during dinner, not to get them to switch, just begging for leftovers. Anything to eat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is leaving the White House for a summer vacation on August 6th. He'll be gone almost a month. Whoo, take a break, yeah. But don't worry, each week he'll give two or three speeches to make sure the market keeps crashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and President Bush, listen to this, today unveiled his new plan to limit greenhouse gases. His new plan? We'll ban all greenhouses. That's it. You shut down the greenhouses, the gases go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just a matter of time before we go into Iraq and oust Saddam Hussein. I think when he [Bush] gets below 50% popularity, I think it's going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton is &quot;very upset. He says he's going to sue HBO over a 1983 FBI surveillance film that they were -- I guess it aired tonight, that shows Al Sharpton discussing a cocaine deal with an undercover FBI agent. Isn't that amazing? Sharpton upset about being on camera?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to Senator Bob Dole. He is 179 years old today. Happy birthday, Senator Bob Dole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, at the party last night, Gloria Stewart from 'Titanic' jumped out of the cake. Beautiful, very sexy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an odd story. A University of Connecticut student has be charged with possession of anthrax spores. Anthrax spores? How filthy was his dorm room?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're finding out more news about the new fall season for the CBS TV programs. Listen to this, this is a blockbuster. Remember the old game show, $25,000 Pyramid? CBS is bringing it back, and it's being hosted by Donny Osmond. Now, apparently, the FBI knew about this last summer, and failed to act on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about these pilots that were drunk, flying the plane drunk? Did you hear about this today? It turns out not only had they had a few, three gallons of beer, before they got on the plane to fly people to Milwaukee or wherever the hell it was. What should have tipped them off was when they tried to roll the keg through the metal detector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good thing about this, since this happened, even terrorists are afraid to fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton &quot;has apparently put on some weight since he left office, so he's getting some exercise equipment delivered up there to his home in Chappaqua. And they say that he had, I don't even know what this would be, it is a 700 pound piece of exercise equipment. And I'm thinking, the last time President Clinton broke a sweat on something that weighed 700 pounds, it got him impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has signed a bill making Nevada's Yucca Mountain a nuclear waste dumping ground. 77,000 tons of radioactive waste is being buried underground 90 miles north of Las Vegas. In fact, it's pretty close to the Mustang Ranch. That sounds safe -- radioactive hookers, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parking lot attendants at the Pentagon are now routinely stopping every 30th car and asking the driver of that car if he or she is smuggling out any classified documents.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read this in the LA Times today - counter-terrorism experts are now saying that Osama bin Laden may be hiding secret messages on pornographic web sites. At least that's what these experts are telling their wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now speculation in Washington that President Bush is planning to increase the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq. And let me tell you something -- if they are half as tough as the economic sanctions Bush has imposed on this country, they are screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today was a good day. The stock market went up. Second largest point gain in history. Went up what -- 496 points, 500 points? You know how it did it? One phone call by Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heads of the Adelphia Cable company -- that's the cable company here in Los Angeles, Adelphia Cable -- were arrested for looting the company.

There's just somethin' great about seeing your cable guy get arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard there's this strange story coming out of Chappaqua. How far away is Chappaqua, its about 20 miles outside of New York City? Chappaqua, listen, here's what happened last night, Allen Iverson breaks into Bill Clinton's house looking for his wife. What is going on, I said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a bar out there in Queens near La Guardia, and they have this promotion, and I think it's very strange, every Wednesday night in this bar by the airport, pilots drink free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has left Washington and is going to Crawford, Texas for a month-long vacation. Now, I know you folks know. I was just letting the FBI know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Bush got out of town faster than he gets out one of his stock deals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's going to be a lot of fun down there in Texas. This weekend the festivities begin, they're going to have an old fashioned Texas style colonoscopy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Bush people, those are his aides, the Bush people, they said the President is taking this month-long vacation because he needs the opportunity to unwind. They said Bush needs to unwind. My question is, when does this guy wind?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart, she still cannot get a break. NBC announced yesterday, they just made this announcement, this network announced that they're planning to make a movie based on the life of Martha Stewart that will cover her recent stock market scandals. It's gonna cover all the bad stuff. Yeah, apparently, NBC is gonna call the movie, 'The Road to Extradition.&quot;Silence of the Lamb Chop?&quot;Blazing Salads?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it will soon be vacation time for our chief executive -- on the heels of the arduous task of unpacking his suitcases from his Kennebunkport vacation two weeks ago, the President plans to leave Washington for his Crawford ranch after his annual physical on August 6th. Assuming the President gets a clean bill of sloth, he will stay at his ranch all the way through Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, some people seem to think the President should be working. Maryland Governor Parris Glendening attacked Bush's vacation plans, saying, quote, 'In times of financial crisis and international crisis, the public looks for hands-on, confident leadership. What we're going to see is every-other-day photo ops from the ranch.' The president quickly denied the accusation, saying, 'Every other day?' What am I, a machine? I'm on vacation here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the police arrested them, they made them wait at the station house between 9 and 5.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, by a vote of 420-1, the house voted to expel Congressman James Traficant. Traficant, you know, was convicted of bribery, extortion and tax evasion, or as Congress calls, that's a triple crown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;420-1 in favor of expelling him. That's pretty amazing. You know the only Congressman who voted to keep him? Gary Condit -- which proves there is honor among thieves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;420-1, that was the final vote. Well, the vote was like 290-0, and that one vote came in. Do you think Traficant went, 'Yes, it's suddenly turning?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news for Traficant, with his record and that hair, he's pretty much assured of finding a job as a TV evangelist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't count this Traficant guy out just yet. He said he may run again. He may run from prison. He can run from prison. And when you think about it, that's about the best place to put together a political team. Look who you got in there. Fellow politicians, corporate executives, legal advisers, financial geniuses. It's just like the outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some hot political gossip. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, President Clinton may be seeing a counselor. In fact, he's also seeing a cocktail waitress, a nightclub singer and two flight attendants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the State Department released a list of gifts George W. Bush has received since becoming President. The first gift was the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Sharpton, God bless him, suing HBO for $1 billion. $1 billion. They're airing a tape of him being approached by an undercover FBI agent about a cocaine deal. Cocaine? $1 billion? I think he's on acid, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rob Lowe, one of the original members of The West Wing, leaving the show. Quitting the show. See, I don't understand this. The show is doing great. The ratings are good. The president on that show, he couldn't be more popular. He has a plan. His country is working, yet, his top official is leaving. The real West Wing, the economy is a disaster, the President's confused, the approval ratings are down, and all his people stay. Shouldn't it be the other way around?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got a great tip from my stockbroker. Did I tell you this? I talked to my stockbroker today. He told me for 39 cents more, he could supersize my fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you how beautiful it is today. You know those two America West pilots, it was so beautiful today they decided to do some drunk boating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the stock market came back 500 points. Crazy. Bush is so confident about economic recovery that he added another month to his vacation, so he will be gone two months now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He started a month long vacation, going to spend an entire month in Texas on the ranch. He made Tom Ridge -- put him in charge of T ball so that will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever Bush goes back to the range there in Texas, he looks to do ranch things, so all day he was out on the front porch practicing on the dinner triangle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this James Traficant. How about that guy? Tossed out of Congress, convicted of bribery and racketeering and tax evasion. I'm thinking, now his hope would be maybe he can become a CEO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the charges against Traficant, they said he made interns do work around his house. I'm thinking that is nothing. I mean Clinton, you know, he made interns do work around his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, due to her legal problems, Martha Stewart's company stock fell to its lowest level since the stock went public. Pretty bad. Yeah, the ironic part is Stewart's stock is finally cheap enough to be sold at Kmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Bill Clinton may be seeing a counselor. They say he's so stressed out about being an ex-President, he's seeing a counselor. Do you believe that? You think Clinton's the kind of guy who would listen to the advice of a counselor? You think he's just pretending to go to the counselor so he can tell Hillary, 'Honey, I'm going down to Times Square, get more therapy. Don't wait up for me, I'll be back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

But he's taking a month off to unwind. So when the White House found out that people were upset that the President was going to be taking a month long vacation they said, no, no, no not just a vacation, he will also be doing some fundraising. All right, okay fundraising, that's fine. That's a whole, take the time off and do some fundraising. Sorry. You're right. Do the fundraising.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a good week. I'm sure you all know the greatest story of all. After being trapped for three days in that Pennsylvania coal mine, all nine miners successfully rescued. It's a wonderful, wonderful story. . I'll tell you something -- were you like me when you first heard there were nine guys hopelessly stuck in a hole? Did you think, 'Oh, my God. The Dodgers, they're in trouble again.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rescue workers drilled a hole 240 feet down to rescue the miners. 240 feet down to get them. And you know, it's already getting political. Like today, President Bush says, 'We can't stop now. There may be some men trapped underground in the Alaska Arctic Reserve. We should start drilling there right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush jogged and played golf over the weekend. Glad to see he's getting some things done before he takes his month-long vacation. Thank God the war and that Middle East thing cleared up, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Jesse Jackson is going to the Middle East. Boy, how much trouble is he in with his wife if he has to go to the Middle East to try and find peace?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's got to be tricky for Jackson. Gonna be tricky over there when he meets Arafat. What's he gonna call him? I mean, you know Jesse. He's not the kind of guy to say 'Yas, sir.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy from Delta Airlines, a pilot they think maybe was flying drunk, we got another one, pilots flying drunk, amazing story. Scary. The FAA is waiting to retrieve the black box from his liver, and then they'll know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continues to be the nine coal miners who were rescued in Pennsylvania. An amazing story. In fact, if you were watching Fox News, Geraldo Rivera, one of the first reporters that was there when the miners came up. See, what they didn't tell you was, as soon as these guys saw Geraldo, five of them tried to go back down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think President Bush is a little confused. Like today, he called the miners to personally congratulate the men and wish them the best. In fact, he said he'd like to buy them a beer, but he couldn't because they were miners.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, thanks for coming out on such a hot day. I tell you, I was sweating like Saddam Hussein watching Bush's poll numbers drop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest reports, the chances of a US attack on Iraq is gaining widespread support in Washington. And according to the New York Times, the new secret plan is a surprise attack on Baghdad, taking the capital first, and then expanding the attack outward using a couple hundred thousand men. Remember, according to the New York Times, this is our new 'secret' plan. So don't tell anyone. It's just for us Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting what's happening with President Bush's popularity. As far as the war against terrorism is going, he's doing great. The people behind him 100%. When it comes to the economy and business, not doing so good. He's dropping, dropping quickly. I think the answer here, pretty obvious. Bush needs to bomb Enron. Get those numbers back up. Blow those guys off the map.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today a Federal judge sentenced Ohio Congressman James Traficant to eight years in prison. This is interesting, Traficant acted as his own attorney. And really, how often do you get to see a criminal and his lawyer both get to go to jail?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news, he could be the first guy to go to prison where the prison haircut would actually be an improvement over his regular haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about that Traficant guy today. Because if the prisons are getting overcrowded, there's a hole in Pennsylvania we're not using now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Martha Stewart stock has dropped $325 million. Give you an idea -- show you how tough it is for her now, she had to give her housekeeper, her cook, her gardener and her pay planner all a reduction in salaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Globe -- you know the Globe. They check, recheck, and then check the facts again. Hillary Clinton has laid down the law about Bill's womanizing. Not a moment too soon, huh? You know, you want to nip that kind of thing right in the bud before it gets out of hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, according to the tabloid, listen to this -- Hillary told Bill he could only cheat outside the US. Which works out great because he's already hit on every woman inside the US. He's got to go outside to find new people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

And this guy's name is, he's Saad bin Laden. And apparently he's very active in Al Qaeda, and he's trying to recruit younger members to participate in Al Qaeda. As a matter of fact, he's just produced his father's most recent video, 'Dude, Where's My Jihad?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[After loud applause] &quot;You sound like Hillary Clinton when she heard Bill was going to war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton, he can't stay out of the papers. ... Last night in Canada, Bill Clinton told a Jewish group that if Iraq attacks in the Middle East, he would personally get in a ditch, grab a rifle and fight for Israel. Apparently, the only place he won't fight is near Southeast Asia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you want Clinton fighting next to you? We know his aim is terrible.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know Clinton, he'll be using this line the pick up women: 'I ship out tomorrow, I don't know if I'll be back. If we don't do it tonight...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, earlier in the week, the FBI arrested two former WorldCon -- did I say WorldCon? I'm sorry, WorldCom executives. ... See, it shows you how times change. One day you're running MCI -- the biggest phone company in the world -- next day, you're only allowed to make one phone call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we have photos showing you what they were thinking as they were being led away. Show that footage -- 'We should have given more money to the Bush campaign.' See that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good stock tip -- buy shares in the company that makes those orange prison jumpsuits. They're gonna be making millions of 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see 'Wall Street Week In Review' this week? It looks more like 'COPS' now. ... To give you an idea of how bad it's getting, the Fortune 500 has now merged with the FBI's most wanted list. It's the same list, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush complained today that the Democratic-controlled Senate is trying to block his program to promote marriage. ... He says the Democrats are blocking it. Democrats aren't blocking it -- it's men. Men are blocking it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush taking his month-long vacation this month -- although he's not calling it that. The White House calling it a 'working vacation.' See, we're working, he's on vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service announced they may put the fish that produces the beluga caviar on the Endangered Species List. See, that's how you know when you're in a Republican administration, okay? When the big environmental issue is 'save the caviar!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Traficant, the disgraced Ohio congressman that went to jail, pretty depressed since going to prison. Though his parish priest has been visiting every day to console him. Well, he's only two cells down. So it's not a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today in New York Al Sharpton was caught on surveillance tape buying a Vanilla Coke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so hot right now I'm sweating more than James Traficant waiting in line for a prison shower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has agreed to be interviewed next month. ... He has agreed to be interviewed next month by '60 Minutes.' And even better, Bush said he thinks he will stay for the entire half hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you get a month vacation? Well, President Bush is beginning his month-long vacation and the White House is calling it a working vacation. I'm thinking that pretty much describes the entire presidency, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush says he's going to be very active when he's on vacation. He plans to exercise every day. He says he exercises every day because it clears his head. Hey, mission accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally today, prison officials did a strip search and removed James Traficant's hair, and here's the weird part: They found a 10th coal miner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush visited those rescued coal miners in Pittsburgh. And Bush really connected with the men. And you know, he's good at that kind of stuff. He told them, 'Hey, I know what it's like to go to work every day and be totally in the dark. To have no idea what's goin' on. This happens to me all the time.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to Texas to begin his month-long vacation. Now, even though he's playing golf and fishing and riding horses, the White House said this is not a vacation. Do you get the idea Bush's definition of 'vacation' comes from the same dictionary where Clinton got the definition of 'sex'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There must be some kind of White House dictionary where things are not always as they seem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Controversial New Jersey Senator Robert Torricelli&quot; is &quot;now running TV ads apologizing for taking illegal cash and gifts from a campaign contributor. See, this is what I love about Washington. This is amazing to me. They take illegal money. And then they use that money to run ads to apologize for taking illegal money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting study. Two years ago, 78% of the American people said they wanted to get rid of the penny. They had no use for it. Get rid of it. Today, only 38% want to get rid of it. Yeah, after the drop in the stock market, those pennies looking pretty good now, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government now trying to increase the population of the fish that produces caviar. They're doing this by putting the fish on the endangered species list. They hope this will help the fish reproduce faster. You know, you want to increase the population of these fish? Stop eating its eggs! Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news up in Vermont. PBS icon Bill Moyers arrested for driving under the influence. You know, what's going on in the world? First they get Martha Stewart for insider trading. Now Bill Moyers, drunk driving. What next, huh? Mr. Rogers busted for selling crack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Boston, Cardinal Bernard-above-the-Law. You know his story. He told the judge, no, no, he never agreed with that $30 million settlement. He said, 'No, no, never agreed to that.' He says under Chapter 11, the church may file for reorganization. How does that work? You can buy a church -- big sign up, 'Under new management,' what does that mean? What, is Satan running the place now?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news, the Dow Jones up 240 points today. It's amazing. The last three days it was down, what -- 692 points? Today, Bush goes on vacation, bam! It's back up again. You know, stay out another month!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in business news, the Justice Department now investigating the accounting practices of AOL. In fact, they changed the greeting from 'You've got mail,' to 'We're in jail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart -- did you hear this? She's being sued by one of her stockholders because of her part in the insider trading scandal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stock market finally had a good day today, nobody got arrested. When has that ever happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush passed his annual physical with flying colors. The President is in tip-top shape. And of course, Bush, very pleased. You know, it's not that often he passes an exam. So he was thrilled.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let's be honest. After eight years of Clinton, isn't it nice to have a President who can finally take his clothes off in front of a stranger and not get sued for it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctor said Bush did have one bad habit, occasionally smoking a cigar in the Oval Office. You know, I just hope they're not cigars that are left over from the last.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President currently on vacation in Texas. So Cheney is going to Wyoming and Congress is in recess. But don't panic, if an emergency should happen, Jake, the White House tour guide, is still on duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Congressman Bob Barr? He was in the news a while back. He's from Georgia. He was at a campaign rally last night someone gave him a .38 caliber pistol as a gift. As a gift. He grabbed it, the gun went off! Bullet flies through the air, hits the wall -- luckily, nobody was killed. But, you know, when the gun went off, the politicians hit the floor. And of course, the Republicans thought it was fired by an angry person with maybe money in the stock market, and the Democrats thought, 'Oh, my God, a jealous husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report to the federal government by the RAND Corporation, . they say Saudi Arabia might actually be a danger to the US. Well, you could have knocked me over -- gee, what do you think the clue was? Maybe the fact that most of the hijackers come from there? Gee, I'm shocked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a current issue of Time magazine, Bill Clinton had a secret plan to make bin Laden go away. Do you believe that? He couldn't make Paula Jones go away. Shut up. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend a 17-year-old kid was arrested for using a cigarette lighter on his tennis shoe during a US Airways flight. He used it to burn excess material off his shoe. And in Seattle, at that airport, a guy was arrested for trying to pass through security with razor blades in his shoes. These guys weren't terrorists, they just weren't thinking. I know we have first class and business class, coach, but is there a new moron class now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The drunken America West pilots, they were in court on Monday for a hearing to schedule their trial, and that didn't go too well. They asked the judge if they could have the trial either in September or November so it wouldn't interfere with Oktoberfest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk in Washington about implementing a so-called 'sanity test' for immigrants who want to come to the US. They can't come in unless they meet our standards of sanity. I mean, imagine being told by the country that's home to Ozzy Osbourne, Jim Traficant and Anna Nicole Smith, 'You are not sane enough. I'm sorry, you are not as smart as these people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, former Rep. Jim Traficant, the disgraced Congressman, he's upset he was sent to a Federal prison in Pennsylvania instead of a prison in his home state in Ohio. Traficant says he plans to run for Congress again and he's concerned that running from out of state could hurt his chances. Gee, how about the fact that he is in prison? Can you hurt your chances any more than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The gun turret of the Civil War battleship the USS Monitor. was recovered yesterday. It's been down there for something like 150 years. But the rest of the ship will remain on the floor of the Atlantic. And today, President Bush said he was saddened to learn there were no survivors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has now asked Martha Stewart for copies of her e-mails and all of her financial records. That's what they want. Yeah. In addition, Congress asked Martha for tips on how to make mango and grape chutney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had his annual physical. And afterwards, his doctors said he is in excellent physical condition. That's right. Doctors say the President has the body of a 30-year-old and the mind of an 8-year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, while Vice President Dick Cheney was giving a speech in San Francisco, a heckler shouted out, 'Dick Cheney is a corporate crook.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney is on the road a lot this year helping to raise money for the Republican Party. So far this year, he has raised $12 million in 44 separate stops. No, I read that wrong. No, his heart has made 44 stops. That's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sam Waksal, the former CEO of ImClone, has been indicted on 13 counts of insider trading, including perjury, bank fraud, and obstruction of justice. In fact, when they told him he can only make one phone call, he called Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not looking good for Martha. It just gets worse and worse. Anybody see her program today? Today, she showed how to make a pinecone into a decorative electronic ankle bracelet cover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge in New York has ruled that a college professor who referred to a female student as 'Monica Lewinsky' is not guilty of sexual harassment. The judge said the most he could get him for, maybe wishful thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, in a speech in Canada, former President Bill Clinton said when it came to protecting Israel, and I quote, 'If Iraq comes across the Jordan border, I will grab a rifle, get in a ditch, fight and die. That's what Clinton said. And of course, Mattel has jumped on this. This is the new GI Bill action figure. Let me show you this thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, everybody makes fun of President Bush for being on vacation, but he's probably working harder now than any President we've ever had.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Transportation Security Administration issued a high-level warning to be on alert for impostors that may try to get on airplanes wearing stolen pilot uniforms.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Saddam Hussein once again lashed out. He said terms like 'the Great Satan.' He said 'evil.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Clinton was partial to Hollywood heavyweights like Stephen Spielberg and Barbra Streisand, Bush has courted his own version of celebrity royalty, like pro golfer Ben Crenshaw and country singer Larry Gatlin. Not at the same time, of course. I mean, you'd just be begging for the place to get trashed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether or not Bush guests were invited to stay in the Lincoln bedroom is unclear, with a White House spokeswoman saying, 'They sleep in a variety of guest rooms in the White House.' So bedrooms in general, not just the Lincoln one. A fine distinction. Not unlike the distinction between oral sex and regular sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Join Iraq's dictator for his first episode, 'I was once a geek but now my bomb- making skills are at their peak.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on such a hot day. Probably the hottest day of the year. . IIn fact, right here at Burbank airport, airline pilots are putting down their vodkas and drinking Gatorade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the stock market was down today. Two major companies declared bankruptcy. One of them a huge trucking company. Consumer spending at an all-time low. In other words, Bush is back at work! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he is committed to the end of global warming. Or as he calls it, winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say President Bush still planning to invade Iraq, but not right now. He's not gonna do it right now. He says he wants to wait at least until he finds out who wins on 'American Idol.' Then after that, possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nelson Mandela said today he disagrees with President Bush on the wisdom of attacking Iraq. Mandela says he's been trying to contact Bush, can't get through. Can't get anybody to talk to him. The problem is he's calling the White House. Bush hasn't been there in months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, on Friday, President Bush came back from his month- long vacation. Only Bush would come back on Friday, before Labor Day, work half a day and then get a three-day weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton has been meeting with CBS about hosting his own syndicated talk show. This may happen now. Clinton hosting a show. This is true. A spokesman for Clinton said Clinton is listening to offers, but has not turned anyone down. Just like his sex life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonalds announced they are coming out with healthier French fries. 50% less fat.&quot; The &quot;idea here is to appeal to the health-conscious McDonalds customer. Well, there's a select group, huh? Kind of like black Republicans, how many can there be, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Russian space program announced that they have kicked out Lance Bass because of late payments. In a related story, Greyhound has announced that they have canceled M.C. Hammer's trip to Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we blew it. We waited too long over the weekend. Sweden invaded Iraq. There goes another wasted opportunity for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of controversy over this possible invasion of Iraq. In fact, Nelson Mandela so upset about Bush calling for Hussein's removal, he actually called Bush's dad. Nelson Mandela called Bush's father.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Bush met with congressional leaders to build support for this war with Iraq. I think Bush is a little confused about the war on terrorism. Like today, he said we are getting closer and closer to capturing Paula Abdul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over Labor Day weekend, reporters from the New York Daily News were able to smuggle razor blades, pepper spray, knives, box cutters and corkscrews past airline security. Got them on the plane. Here's the worst part. They were hidden inside a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The airlines are no longer asking passengers those tough security questions they have been asking since 1986. You know, when you fly, they ask you, 'Did you pack your bags yourself? Was this bag ever out of your control?' Did that ever work? Were there ever any terrorists tripped up by that? They fly all the way from Saudi Arabia, they get here, the kid goes, 'Did you pack your bag yourself?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Internal Revenue Service is reporting that a number of their computers are missing. They can't find some of their computers. Let's hope they saved their receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here are some of the signs that the college you're attending may be a party school. . If George W. Bush went there, it's a party school.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Congress is gonna hold their first official session in New York City in over 200 years. Yeah, gonna be comin' to New York. First time in 200 years. When asked to comment, Senator Strom Thurmond said, 'I'm anxious to see how the city's changed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looked there for a minute like former President Clinton was going to have his own talk show right here on CBS. We were all excited because how much fun would that be, to bump into Bubba at the commissary and...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But last night on Larry King Live, he told Larry King that he's not going to be doing the talk show here at CBS, and the problem was he found out that they wanted him to interview Survivor losers on his show. And so he said, 'That will be it.' Not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So sadly it's official, Clinton decided to back out of the deal with CBS to host his very own talk show right here at CBS. And...wait a minute. You can do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell was booed at the earth summit yesterday at his presentation of President Bush's environmental policy. Bush was pretty surprised when he heard about it. Not the booing, the fact that he had an environmental policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colin Powell said President Bush is committed to preserving the world's natural wonders. In fact, he said the President plans to build another Grand Canyon in Iraq, right in downtown Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a very revealing and courageous announcement earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said he is sorry he did not get Osama bin Laden. He said he's also sorry he did not get Catherine Zeta-Jones, Sharon Stone, or the Dixie Chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time ever, the nation of Nigeria is going to stone a man to death. Stone a man to death for committing adultery. Well, there's one African country Jesse Jackson won't be going to for a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember Bill Clinton. The thing was, you had a deal to do a talk show right here at CBS. We were all excited because it was a done deal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of flight attendants are complaining they have not been adequately trained to defend themselves from terrorists. Although a lot of them had had experience fighting off Frank Gifford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As part of an investigation, reporters for the New York Daily News were able to smuggle knives, razor blades, box cutters, and other weapon-like devices past airport security on the plane. And I'll tell you, a lot of these airport personnel are distracted. We had a camera set up at Burbank Airport. Look at some of the stuff they're getting through. Take a look. This is right in Burbank. Now look. That looks like a weapon. That looks like a bomb. Now what are they watching on the monitor? Kelly Clarkson! They're watching American Idol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most recent survey says that 56% of the American people are not supportive of the United States going to war with Iraq. But when you mention the possibility that these people could be shooting at Geraldo, the approval rating goes way up to 95%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in over 200 years, Congress assembled in New York City instead of Washington today for a symbolic session. That's what New York needs, more pickpockets walking the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, this was big thrill for Senator Hillary Clinton. She'd never been to New York before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the talk is they may change their national anthem from 'Oh, Canada' to 'Oh, Wow, Canada.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's more talk about war with Iraq. How many think we should go after Saddam Hussein? How many think we should wait until at least we catch some of those Enron guys first?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to ABC News, Saddam Hussein's former mistress claims that Saddam uses Viagra. Judging by how grumpy he is all the time, I'm guessing it's not working.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this time, Bush has been painting Hussein as the face of evil. Turns out he's really the face of erectile dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why he keeps throwing those inspectors out. He wasn't worried about them finding the weapons, he doesn't want them finding his Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to his mistress. Saddam Hussein enjoys watching tapes of people being tortured. So apparently they get 'American Idol' over there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yasser Arafat is calling for outlawing suicide bombings in the Middle East. . If you are thinking about becoming a suicide bomber, be warned, you could end up in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say Senator Hillary Clinton has adopted a completely new look. In fact, it's so new, today Bill accidentally hit on her. That's how new it was. He didn't even realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the story that's in this week's US News and World Report -- claims that Bill Clinton is furious that women are trying to set him up in compromising positions. Well, it started last month at the Democratic fundraiser when a woman in Arkansas walked through a receiving line and grabbed Bill Clinton's private parts. Yeah and she was immediately wrestled to the ground by Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush spoke out about the West Nile virus. Bush said, 'We will get these computer hackers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting historically, on Friday 300 members of Congress were here in New York City. I don't believe it's ever happened in 200 years, the US Congress came here to New York City, and man, talk about trouble, the mayor had to hire 200 temporary hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC has this interview with one of Saddam Hussein's girlfriends and this guy, have you seen him? He's nothing if not a ladies man. And she says that this guy, that he uses Viagra. Saddam Hussein uses Viagra, his favorite food is gazelle, I just learned that a second ago. His favorite food is gazelle. He likes dancing to Frank Sinatra's 'Strangers in the Night.' I'm telling you, folks, it's like I have a twin! It's like I have a twin brother!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, his favorite food actually is gazelle, but if he's in a hurry, he'll just grab a quick goat on a roll.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this story concerning the Miss America Pageant? It seems the judge has ruled there should be two -- two -- Miss North Carolinas. Two winners, the judge said. Today, Al Gore said, 'Why couldn't I get that deal? What happened to me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time, Attorney General John Ashcroft has announced that we are now in Code Orange, high alert. That means there is a very strong likelihood Martha Stewart will break the law again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now being reported that Saddam Hussein takes Viagra and has as many as six mistresses. Well, no wonder Congress is reluctant to act on this guy. He's one of their own.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saddam, see, he is a clever guy. He told his wife they are not mistresses. He said when they're on top of him, they're just acting as human shields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political allies and friends of Bill Clinton say Bill is being dogged by women trying to put him in compromising situations. You know, when are these women gonna learn that when men say no, it means no, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see, what happened today in Floriduh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Florida, Janet Reno went to court to extend the voting hours. Of course, faulty voting machines prevented a lot of people from voting at 7:00 AM when the polls opened. Faulty voting machines in Florida? What are the odds?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I don't understand this. How come lottery machines never screw up, but voting machines do? Nobody ever accidentally wins the $10 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest poll show that Janet Reno is neck and neck with her closest opponent, Bill McBride, which I believe is the first time any guy has ever been neck and neck with Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A guy &quot;in 1995 had a thing, a medical problem and he goes into a coma. . Over the weekend he woke up and apparently he is he is going to be all right. Right now they are slowly trying to explain the Clinton years to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC has an interview with one of Saddam Hussein's girlfriends and it will be on later in the week. The guy apparently -- he's quite a ladies man. He has five or six girlfriends. They did an interview with this woman. They said his favorite food. Every day he picks out a gazelle to be slaughtered for dinner that night. Are you like me? I get queasy picking out a lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to President Bush, Iraq has the nuclear bomb. They have developed a nuclear bomb. The good news is, yes, they have developed a nuclear bomb, the good news is they have to drop it from a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Tuesday and it's primary election day all over the US. Down in Florida there may be an upset in the election today. If Janet Reno loses, here is what she is going to do. She's going to do what Al Gore did when he lost, she's going to gain 50 pounds and grow a beard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Canada's Prime Minister said that as of now, Canada will not help the US if we decide to launch a strike on Iraq. Canada's not going to help. Yeah, when asked why, Canada's Prime Minister said, 'I'd like to help, but I'm pretty sure we don't have an army.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno was turned away from the voting booth at least once before she was allowed to vote. They turned her away. Yeah, apparently, the voting clerk finally recognized Reno when she picked up the voting booth and threw it through the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney again today moved to an undisclosed location. In fact, this place is so secret the only other time it's been used before is when Bill was hiding from Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more details coming out about Saddam Hussein. Seems he raises gazelles as pets. And when he gets hungry, he occasionally eats one. That's his favorite food -- gazelle. He eats his own pets. He is in real trouble now, okay? Forget the CIA, forget the US government, you get those PETA people after you, you're screwed. Okay, that's it. They will track you down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears at this point, Janet Reno may have lost. But of course, this is Florida. We won't have the results for at least another eight months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says that women who have been to prison, even for a short time, tend to become cynical, angry and aggressive. And you think Martha Stewart is bitchy now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that the security alert went from yellow to orange today. It went from yellow to orange, just like the egg salad at Rupert's Hello Deli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it goes orange, I think that must be very serious, because there's nothing that rhymes with orange, so it must be very serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's been six months. We haven't heard anything from the guy, we haven't seen the guy, we don't know where the guy is, we don't know whether he's dead or alive, it's like he's dropped off the face of the planet. But enough about Tom Ridge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought that President Bush gave an excellent speech this morning. I hope you saw it. He gave a terrific, terrific speech, and he had some strong words for Saddam Hussein in his speech.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said allowing Saddam Hussein to get his hands on a nuclear weapon would be like handing the car keys back to Nick Nolte. That's what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi ambassador to the UN, he blasted President Bush's speech today. He just blasted him. He accused Bush of deceiving the world with the longest series of fabrications that have ever been told by the leader of a nation. So I guess he never heard Clinton speak.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said he wants a change. He wants a change so the people of Iraq should be allowed to choose their own leader. Good luck. We can't even get the people of Florida to choose their own leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they figured it out today what happened with the Florida election. Apparently the voting machines are still clogged with Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the Florida voters didn't understand how to use the new touch- screen voting machine. Apparently, instructions and the name were too confusing. You touch the screen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the other ones were too primitive? You know, they don't need a governor. They should just appoint a king down there so these people don't have to go vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Congress asked the Justice Department to begin a criminal investigation of Martha Stewart. And her friends think -- you are glad? Well, a lot of Martha's friends think she's getting a little paranoid. Like today in the kitchen when she was poking the Pillsbury Doughboy, she wasn't trying to tickle him. Checking to see if he was wearing a wire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Hawaii woke up this week after seven years in a coma. Yeah, reportedly the first thing the man said was, 'George W. Bush is what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday it was announced that in Florida's race for governor, Janet Reno, who had a 30-point lead in June, lost the Democratic primary. Janet Reno lost. Yeah. Yeah, when asked about it, Reno said, 'I feel like I've been kicked in the nuts.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, President Clinton finally got his own talk show on CBS, mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton was on show last night but, frankly, I'm glad he's gone. I can go back to making Clinton jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it looks like Janet Reno lost a primary election for governor in Florida, like she...I don't know. And they think what hurt her were the allegations of steroid, that's what they think hurt her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday night, five suspected Al Qaeda members were arrested in Buffalo, New York. Five. I think prison is too good for these people. I say let's leave them in Buffalo. Let them die of boredom.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the alleged Al Qaeda members, one of the guys arrested, earned his living as a car salesman. Car salesman to terrorist. That's pretty much a lateral move, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said these are the first known terrorists in the Buffalo area since O.J. played for the Bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big question: Who do you think is more likely to get bombed this weekend, Iraq or Nick Nolte?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sesame Street had a great, great show this morning. They were teaching adults in the state of Florida how to count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida's new high-tech touch-screen voting machines do not seem to be working too well. There's a well thought-out plan: let's go to the state with the most old people in it, and bring in machines that require good eyesight and a steady hand. That'll work good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Forget voting machines, my relatives in Florida still can't figure out how to work the answering machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, parts of Florida were hit by Tropical Storm Hannah which knocked out the electricity. If it wasn't bad in Florida before, now they're counting ballots in the dark, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does not look good for Janet Reno. Looks like she's not going to win. She may have to go back to her old job in the private sector working as the Brawny paper towel guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore insisting that an online report stating that he's decided to run for president again in 2004 is completely wrong. He says he's so disappointed in the online report, he said he's sorry he invented that whole Internet thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney just had a heart checkup at a Washington, DC, hotel room. A hotel room. How bad is health care when the Vice President is standing in line at Days Inn to get a health care checkup?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctor said Dick Cheney's heart rate is now 110 beats per week. That can't be good, can it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney's only restriction is, because he has a pacemaker, he can't make a cell phone call from his left side. How scary is that, when the two most powerful men in this country can be taken out with a box of pretzels and cell phone? That's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new outbreak of smallpox has a lot of people concerned. President Bush said today, 'We've got to stop this before it becomes big pox.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New movie coming out about the life of Saddam Hussein. It's called 'My Big Fat Iraqi Funeral.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like Hussein may have blinked. Did you see that? Bush getting tough, and he backed off. He now says he will allow weapons inspectors into Iraq, but only under one condition -- they must all be former airport security screeners.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said today he wants some pilots to carry guns on planes, but he said only the planes that have terrorists on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI continues to interrogate those five suspected Al Qaeda members they arrested up the in the Buffalo area. They said they caught these guys when they were using satellite phones with prepaid minutes on them to disguise their communications. But see, that's what gave them away: Their number was 1-800-JIHAD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney had his heart checkup the other day. And his doctors said his physical went very well. In fact, they said he is as healthy as a hawk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news. Two great seven-footers stepped down today -- Patrick Ewing and Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno finally conceded the election in Florida today because, according to the most current numbers, it looks like she lost the popular vote. Now I'm confused. Doesn't that mean she won in Florida?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After that 2000 election debacle they had down there, Florida spent $32 million to fix the election. That's what they got -- a fixed election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more complaints continue to come down about the voting system down there in Florida. Now a lot of the older voters saying having to choose between two names is too confusing. They say it would be a lot easier if there was just one name to pick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's been running ads looking for interns to work in his office in Harlem. You can pretty much write your own joke there. I'll step back from that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently it's a three-step process. First, you fill out the application. Then, of course, the interview. Then, of course, finally, the weigh-in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why he calls them interns? Because he does them all in turn.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up in Santa Cruz, city officials said they would allow a medical marijuana co-op to hand out free marijuana at city hall. That's a pretty good deal, isn't it? Beats the hell out of that free government cheese Reagan gave out back in the '80s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what I love about California. This is the only state in the Union where it's illegal to smoke in any public place unless it's marijuana.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq has agreed to allow UN weapons inspectors into their country, which is pretty amazing, when you realize we can't even get weapons inspectors into Puff Daddy's place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why did Saddam Hussein all of a sudden come to his senses the other day? Why the big change? It turns out, nothing to do with Bush's speech at the UN. Nothing to do with that. What happened was, Monday, Hussein saw the first episode of 'The Dr. Phil Show' -- and he realized he hadn't been living an authentic life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration said today there's a lot of support out there for us to attack Iraq. A lot of people are for it -- Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news, of course, has been the capture of that terrorist cell out there in Buffalo. It was a sleeper cell. It wasn't supposed to be a sleeper cell, but once they got to Buffalo, they just dozed off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces in Afghanistan have captured a man they believe to be a top financial officer for Al Qaeda. He is now locked away in a military prison. Which makes him the first CEO the Bush Administration has actually made do hard time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that if the presidential election were held today, things would still be completely screwed up in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new nominee for idiot politician of the year. Very excited about this nomination. Illinois Democratic Congressman Rod Blagojevich. This guy, Rod Blagojevich -- he announced he has tried marijuana twice, but he can't remember if he inhaled. Let me tell you something, pal, if you can't remember if you inhaled, you inhaled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Congressman Brian Baird is introducing a bill. He wants to make it illegal for a congressman to have sex with an intern, unless she's assigned to someone else. In other words, if she's under you, she can't be under you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that Saddam Hussein's policy is to deceive, delay and deny. Which is weird, because that was my girlfriend's policy in high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he is still committed to a change of leadership. And today, Al Gore said, 'Hey, me, too.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's good news and bad news concerning Saddam Hussein. First, the bad news. According to a former Iraqi nuclear scientist, Hussein could have the bomb by Christmas. The good news -- hopefully he'll be dead by Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hussein says he will now allow UN weapons inspectors into Iraq, or as he calls them, human shields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he said he's not afraid of these weapons inspectors. Well, duh, a guy with three wives and six mistresses, he knows how to hide stuff, believe me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out one of these six alleged terrorists arrested in Buffalo, one of the deeply religious men up there, gambled away $89,000 at a Niagara Falls casino. He would have lost more money, but he had to get back to planning an attack against America because we're decadent and immoral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Afghanistan's national airline has resumed flights to Western Europe after a 20-year hiatus. Afghanistan national airlines. Boy, you think a lot of people look like terrorists on your flight, huh? And good luck ordering the kosher meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Congressman named Brian Baird is introducing a bill to make it illegal for a member of Congress to have sex with an intern unless she is assigned to someone else.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American teenagers are taking a hard line on business ethics. Nine out of ten teenagers said they would not work for any corporation accused of wrongdoing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We start by offering a hearty congratulations to the city of Buffalo, New York. A lot of people thought you were an aging Rust Belt city in decline, but according to Federal investigators, terrorists believe you are very much worth destroying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI began tracking the men in June 2001, after they returned from Afghanistan's al-Farouk terrorist training camp. Interesting tidbit: al- Farouk is just across the lake from al-Fatima, the girls' terrorist training camp. Apparently, there were some shenanigans this year. All were killed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we bring democracy to Iraq or even Afghanistan, it might be prudent to bring it to Florida. We don't have to bring regime change to the whole state. We can start in Pensacola and work our way down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was left unclear after yesterday's hearings [with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld], is what will happen after Saddam is gone? Democracy seems unlikely, so the hope is that Saddam will be replaced by a more pliable leader, someone we can work with to keep the country under control, maintain regional balance of power. Someone sympathetic, secular, someone like, oh...1982 Saddam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and two other former Tyco executives have been charged with looting their company of hundreds of millions of dollars. If that weren't enough, putting a good deal of that toward private purchases on the company tab, including $36 million worth of homes, two sets of sheets for nearly $6,000, and a shower curtain valued at $6,000. I'll tell ya, for that price, it had really better keep small puddles from forming on the bathroom floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the most egregious example, Kozlowski spent $2.1 million on a lavish birthday party for his wife, complete with roman gladiators at the door and an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David that dispensed vodka from its penis. Classy and a perfect accompaniment to the beluga caviar oozing out its ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky Governor Paul Patton, who is being sued by a woman for sexual harassment, admitted at a press conference that yes, he did have an inappropriate personal relationship with this woman.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, former Vice President Al Gore gave a speech on what he thinks should be done about Saddam Hussein. I tell you, he is a vibrant speaker. I have never seen anyone electrify a room the way Gore did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was so hot &quot;I was sweating like Saddam Hussein listening to the B- 52s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that it's now time for a change in Iraq, and he wants them to have a Western-style democracy like ours. So right now in Iraq, the economy is collapsing, businessmen are corrupt and Hussein wants his son to take over as president. Sounds like mission accomplished pretty much, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soon-to-be 100-year-old Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond bid farewell to his colleagues on the Senate floor yesterday. He's retiring at 100. Who retires at 100? What are you going to do, go skiing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians in Germany made the news this week by saying that President Bush is using the war on Iraq to distract Americans from domestic issues. Hey, let me tell you something. We don't need the war to distract us, okay? We've got 'American Idol,' we've got 'Survivor,' we've got 'ER.' We've got porno movies, we've got the Internet. When are we not distracted?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a scientific question. This is one of those questions people mull over, they had scientists working on for years. They never came up with an answer. Why doesn't Al Gore fall asleep during his own speeches?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down South, they're starting to feel the effects of that Hurricane Isidore. It's unbelievable. In fact, today, winds were so song the Governor of Kentucky was actually blown into bed with his own wife. That's how bad it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush will still not say the name 'Al Gore.' Under no circumstances will he say the name 'Al Gore.' And listen to this, he will also not say the name 'Heath Ledger.' Isn't that strange?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is in Africa, and it's sad because I didn't realize this, he's gained so much weight that the entire time he's there, he's been stalked by ivory poachers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton is in Africa with Kevin Spacey. And meanwhile, Al Gore is at Denny's with Tom Postum. So that's the way that goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Gore is &quot;trying to campaign again. He gave a big speech yesterday at a Democratic fundraiser. Al Gore asked the crowd, 'Are you better off than you were two years ago?' That's what he asked in his speech. Yeah, and most people in the crowd said, 'No, but at least we're better off than Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as war with Iraq, a lot of ongoing debates still going on. This week, Al Gore said President Bush is making a big mistake by going it alone without the UN. Gore said, 'Hey, I know what it's like. I'm home alone all day. It's no fun!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore also asked Americans this week, 'Are you better off today than you were two years ago?' And in Florida, a number of voters said, 'We don't understand the question. We're confused. Are we getting off today? What did he say?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Congress heard testimony from the nation's troubled airlines. There's talk of a bailout for the airline industry. The airlines say they want $7 billion for security, plus $5 for the headset.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Strom Thurmond is retiring. He turns 100 years old in December. Or as Anna Nicole Smith calls him, 'The Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love when these guys get caught. Kentucky Governor Paul Patton, who this week admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a woman. I love when men talk like that. 'Cause that's what they say to each other when they're in the men's room. 'Hey, she and I had an inappropriate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, he announced he is withdrawing from the Senate race in 2004. And now the woman he had the affair with is claiming the Governor had a sexual affair with another woman. When did he have time to be Governor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Governor said he was dropping out of the race out of concern for his family. Don't you love that? Politicians are always thinking about their family after they get caught. They never think about their family when their pants are down around their ankles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend in Chicago, these punks, father and son, I guess it was father and son day at the park, they jump out and beat up the first base coach. And what happened, sadly, is it inspired a lot of copycat crimes. Earlier today, Senator Tom Daschle was beaten to a pulp by both George Bushes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes adults, grownups in high powerful positions, can be silly. Like George Bush, we're finding out right now he refuses to say the name 'Al Gore.' That's silly, isn't it. The last time used the name 'Al Gore' in a sentence, he said to his brother Jeb, 'Hide all of those Al Gore ballots.' That was the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton on a big trip to Africa. Bill Clinton is just like a regular tourist doing all of the sightseeing and stuff. I guess day before yesterday, maybe this morning, he took a ride on an elephant. And I was thinking, 'Jeez, he hasn't mounted something that big since he was impeached.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart's stock broker's assistant has agreed to testify against Martha in Federal court. He's going to spill the beans. Yeah, and the testimony is expected to be shocking. He's going to say she uses instant gravy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Senator Bob Torricelli. This guy has dropped out of the US Senate race because of all these financial and ethical scandals. So that's one down, 99 to go.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A California congressman today was reporting back on his trip to Baghdad.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, Ted Kennedy came out against the war with Iraq. I was thinking about this. Saddam Hussein has three wives and six mistresses. So Ted thinks they could be related. He could be a Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's Time magazine -- Time magazine is becoming like the Enquirer now. A Pakistani businessman claims he had a homosexual affair with American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh. Say what you will, but when this guy decides to play for the other team, he goes all the way, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Pakistani businessman told Time magazine he was John Walker Lindh's lover. And apparently, Lindh would like it when he screamed out, 'Who's your Baghdaddy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart had an interesting show this morning. She showed people how to make bail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the American Taliban guy, that John Walker Lindh? Listen to this, turns out now he might be gay. The American Taliban might be a homosexual. I don't know about you, but this sounds like a job for Dr. Phil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that there are signs indicating that the guy may be gay. At one time he actually tried to organize a jihad and brunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's Time magazine, a Pakistani businessman claims he was the gay lover of American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh. I don't know.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one clue he might be gay. Apparently, when he was questioned by the FBI, he said the people he most admired were Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and Cher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lindh may be both a terrorist and a gay man. That's gotta be John Ashcroft's worst nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq will be holding their election on October 15. And Saddam Hussein is the only name on the ballot. He's the only one on the ballot in the whole country. You know what's amazing? The people of Florida would still screw this up somehow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report on CNN, the average man in Iraq lives to be 66 years old. And the good news: Saddam Hussein is 65 1/2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to today's L.A.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market skyrocketed 300 points today. Experts say that investors' fears are being calmed about a possible war with Iraq knowing now that Barbra Streisand is in charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand sent Dick Gephardt a memo telling him she does not think we should invade Iraq. See, don't you love the way our government works? This is amazing. Barbra Streisand sends a memo to a high- ranking government official, he gets it, no problem, he deals with it, he talks with people, boom. For months, the FBI sent dozens of memos on terrorism to Bush. 'We don't know where they are. We lost them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Senator Robert Torricelli, who was forced to step down yesterday because of his ethical and financial misdeeds, said to the American people in his little tearful good-bye yesterday, he said, this is his quote, 'I gave you 20 years of my life.' And to be fair, that's what we should give him. 20 years to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Senator Torricelli, he said he wouldn't run in New Jersey, so he is stepping aside. I'm thinking, 'Why don't the Jets do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You really have to feel sorry for him because you know for the campaign he used millions and millions of his own bribe money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he is dropping out because he was running a distant second. Geez, you don't see me do that, do you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a fundraiser just the other night, Barbra Streisand was criticizing President Bush, and in the speech, she quoted Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, but it turns out that the line she quoted wasn't Shakespeare's. It was actually written by someone on the Internet. The mistake was pretty obvious because the quote was, 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your naked pictures of Alyssa Milano.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the assistant to Martha Stewart's stockbroker, Douglas Faneuil, reached a plea bargain with the FBI. He is going to testify against her. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you love it when you see these Wall Street guys getting hauled off to prison? This is great, isn't it? 'Cause, see, they're used to all the perks. Then when they go to prison, they are the perks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein said today that weapons' inspectors can look anywhere they want in Iraq except specific areas that are sensitive. That's the same deal Bill had with Hillary, you know what I'm saying? Like, she can look anywhere she wanted, except under the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On October 15th, Saddam Hussein up for reelection in Iraq, but his name is the only one on the ballot. There's only one name. Do you think the news channels will hold off predicting the results until all the outlying districts are in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to intelligence experts, Saddam Hussein uses up to three doubles. Today President Bush said, 'Three doubles? That's six, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people don't realize this, but President Bush also has a double. The problem is he's smarter than Bush, so they keep him hidden away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine says this week that American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh had a homosexual relationship with a Pakistani businessman while he was in Afghanistan. The Pakistani businessman is denying the claim. He said, yes, he did have a relationship with John Walker Lindh, but it was of a religious nature, in which he claims he was the older mentor. You know, like a priest and an altar boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine says that Walker had his gay relationship while he attended the Al Qaeda terrorist school. So apparently they must have a drama department.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do this all the time. Here's a guy. The man is a traitor. He's called for the destruction of the US. He's taking up arms against his own people, and what do people say? 'I think he's gay. Do you think he's gay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are trying to replace New Jersey Senator Robert Torricelli with former Senator Frank Lautenberg. Torricelli had to quit after he was criticized by his fellow senators for getting illegal campaign contributions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, Florida Governor Jeb Bush leads Democratic challenger Bill McBride by six points. Six points. Of course, since it's Florida, there is a 2,000-point margin of error.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in California, Governor Gray Davis vetoed a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses. Which is ironic, because they're the only people in California who actually carpool, and they're not allowed to drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Torricelli, a senator from New Jersey, dropped out of the New Jersey Senate race. Because he didn't think he had a chance of winning, he dropped out.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the bad news, that Hurricane Lili hit New Orleans today. The good news: The economy is so bad, most of the businesses already boarded up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush reminded Saddam Hussein there are only 83 more bombing days till Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is talking tough. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer all but called for the assassination of Saddam Hussein. He said something like this: He said we could save money if we just had one bullet. And today, Robert Blake said, 'Hey, I think I know a guy.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech in England yesterday, Bill Clinton strongly implied we are headed for war. Hey, just the fact that Clinton is in England proves we are headed for war, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqis are getting ready to vote on October 15th. The only name on the ballot: Saddam Hussein. In fact, that's his campaign slogan: 'I'm it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went to Congress to get permission to use military force against Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand coming under fire this week after her big Democratic fundraiser the other night, where she raised over $6 million. She quoted Shakespeare. It turns out the quote she used was not really Shakespeare. I don't think Shakespeare ever used the phrase, 'Get jiggy with it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out these are just quotes falsely attributed to Shakespeare that were circulating on the Internet. But she said today she's a big fan of Shakespeare, and so is her husband James Brolin. In fact, he said his favorite Shakespeare play, 'Taming of the Shrew.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time magazine says John Walker Lindh &quot;is gay. They said he had a homosexual relationship with a Pakistani businessman. Now John Walker Lindh's lawyer using this in his defense. Did you see this? Now he said Lindh went to Al Qaeda by accident. He thought he was going to Ikea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in his speech in Washington, DC, Al Gore said the US economy is in big trouble. Do you know why he said that? Because he can't find a job. He's been out of work for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is raising speculation because he has been going around without his wedding ring. Have you seen him? I think there's another woman, Sara Lee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen Al? I don't want to say Al Gore's put on a few pounds, but last week Bill Clinton hit on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big confusion going on in New Jersey. Democrats there have gone to court to replace Senator Robert Torricelli, whose name was taken off the ballot because of ethical misdeeds of some kind. Gee, I wonder what they were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans say, 'No, no, no, it's too late.' They're challenging this court action. They're challenging the whole thing. New Jersey could soon accomplish the impossible. They could actually make the Florida elections look good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Saddam Hussein said, 'See, this is what happens when you put more than one name on the ballot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Producers at CNN Headline News are now adding hip-hop phrases to their news crawl. They're putting hip-hop phrases in there to make the news more acceptable to the younger audiences. But see, they're trying way too hard. Look, see what it says. 'Bush wants UN permission to bust a cap in Hussein's ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart got a great tip from her broker today. He said, 'Run!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you remember Vice President Al Gore? He is giving a speech somewhere the other day and somebody said, 'What happened to your wedding ring?' And he said, 'I have gotten so fat I can't wear my wedding ring.' I thought, wait a minute, isn't that an old Clinton trick?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's not worried about it. He thinks this could be an advantage for the next election. He calculates now that his ass could be worth 12 electoral votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Al Gore said that when it comes to the economy, President Bush is 'like a lost driver who won't stop to ask for directions.' That's what he said. Of course, people ask Gore for directions all the time because he's now working at a gas station.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! You sound like Al Gore when he heard the ice cream truck pull up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore told reporters he's gained so much weight lately, his wedding ring doesn't fit on anymore. They tried everything to get it on. They tried butter, they tried Crisco, they tried corn oil. I'm sorry, that's what Al had for lunch.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen Al lately? In fact, now he goes to the fundraising dinners just for the dinner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore's staff said this is part of his comeback plans. He wants to attract followers with his gravitational pull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats said today they want President Bush to put the same emphasis on the economy that he's putting on Iraq. Which I think is wrong. I think it's just the opposite. If Bush can destroy Iraq as much as he's destroyed the economy, this whole thing will work out great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a man jumped a fence at the UN, pulled a gun out, shot five shots in the air. Luckily, no one was injured. Here is my question: How good are these UN weapons inspectors if they can't find a guy with a gun at the UN?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A member of Saddam Hussein's Cabinet, I think it's the vice president, made a bizarre statement this week. He said he thinks Saddam Hussein and George Bush should settle their differences by a duel with pistols. See, that's okay. Bush is from Texas. Bush know house to handle a pistol. Now, a game of Scrabble, that would frighten me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's 'Time' magazine, American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh may be a homosexual. Apparently, this kid was willing to do anything to fit in. When he was in Afghanistan, oh, he's Islamic. Now he's going to prison, oh, suddenly he's gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to improve its ratings among young viewers, the producers at CNN are adding hip-hop phrases to the news crawl across the bottom to make it more accessible to younger audiences. How stupid is this? Look at this: 'White House homie Ari Fleischer says, 'Somebody take out a nine and smoke Saddam Hussein's punk ass.' . 'New dawg on Jersey ballot.' You see? 'Biggie Al can't be doing bling bling.' You see, it's just stupid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jerry Falwell &quot;calls the Prophet Muhammad a terrorist and says the religion of Islam has a fringe of radicals. And believe me, when it comes to religious radicals, Jerry Falwell knows what the hell he's talking about, ladies and gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about those arrests up in Portland today? First the good news: For the first time, Tonya Harding was not involved. I believe it was the first time there's ever been an arrest in the Portland area where she was not involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six American citizens arrested today for having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network. And here's the shocking part: All of them have agreed to testify against Martha Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More trouble for Martha Stewart today. Now she's being sued by the Pillsbury Doughboy. Did you hear about this? Doughboy now claiming that many years ago, Martha inappropriately fondled his doughnut.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, President Bush made a primetime speech to the nation from Cincinnati. He was in Cincinnati to declare Bengals Stadium a Federal disaster area.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush was there to make his case on why we need to go to war with Iraq. And then, of course, afterwards, Barbra Streisand gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said tonight there are three reasons we need to go to war right now: the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC, CBS and ABC refused to give Bush air time. Isn't that amazing? That ABC is still a major network?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the major networks refused to give him air time. NBC said they would air the speech, but only if our President, Martin Sheen, delivered it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said tonight that after the war, he will help rebuild Iraq's economy. Which is pretty amazing. For two years, Bush hasn't had an economic plan. He finally comes up with one, and it's for Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh sentenced to 20 years in prison. He told the authorities as part of his training over there, he was taught how to shoot from a moving car. And, of course, being from California, he already knew how to do this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anybody watched Martha Stewart's show this morning. Pretty good show. She had a helpful little hint on how you could get metal cups that rustic, antique, distressed look. Rub them up and down the bars yelling 'Guard! Guard!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The town of Guys, Tennessee, is holding an election for alderman with no names on the ballot. Finally an election even the people of Florida couldn't screw up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court with its infinite wisdom, one of their first cases, they will decide if burning a cross on your front lawn is protected by free speech. It shows you what a strange country we live in. You burn leaves on your front yard, you go to jail. You burn a cross, well, that's free speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has put on so much weight, his Secret Service code name is now Anna Nicole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, President Bush addressed the nation. Not one - - not one of the major networks would give him air time. Isn't that unbelievable? In fact, NBC, they told the President outright, 'Look, you want to be on our network at 8:00 PM on Mondays, you better eat a bowl of ringworms on &quot;Fear Factor.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox is the only one&quot; to air the speech, &quot;and of course, you know Fox, they had to air it as 'When Presidents Attack.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea of how few people watched the President's speech last night, he started the address by saying, 'My fellow American.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said when it comes to Iraq, 'We can't wait for final proof.' That was his actual quote. &quot;We can't it for final proof.' Which is of course the same thing he said in Florida during the presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said that the time for denying, deceiving and delaying has come to an end. And today, Martha Stewart said, 'Hey, mind your own business, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Martha Stewart has resigned from the New York Stock Exchange. She resigned. She only took the job four months ago, and then she resigned. She said she is too busy. Which I can understand. Hey, you know how long it takes to pack when you are going away for ten years?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a little worried about tonight's monologue. We had better jokes, but as you probably know, they're struck on a freighter here at the harbor here in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government said today the US medical community is ready for a quick response in the event of a biological attack. They said in a biological attack, we could immunize everyone in the US in like three days -- unless of course you have an HMO. Then you have to contact your primary doctor, who will refer you to a specialist, and then in six to eight weeks, then you can get your immunization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past Friday, six terror suspects were arrested in a suburban neighborhood in Portland. That's scary, isn't it? Remember when the only terrorists in the suburbs were like Amway or Jehovah Witnesses?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Al Jazeera network says they had broadcast a new tape -- supposedly a new tape from Osama bin Laden. Which, you know, they are just like our networks. They promise new tapes, same old crap. Same old shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday, Jesse Jackson, 61 years old. Happy birthday to Jesse. If you're looking to get Jesse a gift, you know, you can't go wrong with a vasectomy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, the Jets are having a tough time. They benched Testaverde, and now they're putting in Senator Frank Lautenberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frank Lautenberg is running for Democratic senator from New Jersey and the campaign got a boost because Bob Torricelli turned over all of his bribe money to the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein. He's got 24 palaces. How many of you only have one or two palaces? And palaces, here's the typical palace. It has a dolphin pool and an amusement park. You know, like the guy wasn't creepy enough already. It's starting to sound like Michael Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a bad idea. This woman in Italy who is like an X-rated film star, an adult film actress, and she came up with a good idea. She was trying to contact Saddam Hussein. She says she'll have sex with Saddam Hussein in return for world peace. About an hour ago, the offer was accepted by former President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush gave his speech outlining the case against Iraq, and the Fox network was the only major network to televise the President's address.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has gotten the courts to force the West Coast seaports to reopen. You know, this labor dispute was costing the American economy $2 billion a day, which is almost as much money as the Bush Administration's cost us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today if the ports did not open by Thanksgiving, a lot of Republicans would have been forced to drink domestic champagne this holiday season.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the arrest of one alleged terrorist in Illinois in one of these phony Muslim charities. See, the name, dead tip off: the 'Make-a-Bomb Foundation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week of course, the big presidential election in Iraq. And although Saddam Hussein is the only candidate on the ballot, it hasn't stopped him. He's actually campaigning. In fact, these are actual bumper stickers that we got off a defector. Now this is a very popular one: 'Are you better off now than you were 4,000 years ago?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this is interesting: 'One politician not afraid to make cuts, just ask Stumpy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hussein always tries to come off as a regular guy. You know, that's his kind of M.O. Over there, this is a big one: 'A man of the people, as long as those people are not Kurds, Shiites, Muslims, Jews or Americans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most popular one. This is the one you see on all the tanks. It says, 'Vote for Hussein. It's Saddameasy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The General Accounting Office announced today that Navy personnel have been using government credit cards to go to Nevada brothels and to buy jewelry. Now there is typical government waste. Who buys jewelry for a hooker?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is the Navy doing in Nevada? Isn't that the desert?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Dow Jones hit its lowest level in five years. Even Martha Stewart lost money, and she's cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost one-third of all Americans are obese. So looks likes Sara Lee is kicking Jenny Craig's ass in this race. That's what Al Gore was doing. He's getting fat to gain more supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In like the next month, the Republican Party is gonna make a serious push to attract Latino voters. President Bush said, 'Yeah, after we get the Latino voters, we're gonna go after the Hispanic voters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House and Senate both approved President Bush's resolution to use force against Iraq. Well, now of course they still have to clear it with Barbra Streisand and Harry Belafonte.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This resolution gives President Bush the power to wage war, or as he calls it, 'Operation Re-Election.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, it was just announced, Barbara Walters will interview Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and they're gonna discuss what it's like to be in power for so long that all your contemporaries retire and die.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the time of the year everybody brings up that old debate, Columbus did not really discover America. Leif Ericsson discovered America. This is the stupidest argument. Think about this. Can either of these people really take credit for discovering this country when there were people on shore meeting them when their boat landed? Columbus discovering America is kinda like Al Gore inventing the Internet.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to the nation on Saturday, President Bush signaling he's now turning his attention towards the economy. He said he's very concerned about job loss -- mainly his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest threat from Al Qaeda is they want to destroy our financial institutions. Let me tell these people something. If they think they can do a better job than we did, go ahead, buddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a move that has just stunned Madison Avenue, Kmart is running brand new commercials featuring Martha Stewart. Apparently Robert Blake was not available, so they went with their second choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gossip columnist Liz Smith is reporting the producers of Hollywood Squares are trying to get Bill Clinton to be the center square, and he's thinking about it. How humbling is that? The same week Jimmy Carter wins the Nobel peace prize, you're nominated for the center square.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could see Bill Clinton on Hollywood Squares. I think he'd be good on Hollywood Squares. 'To Tell The Truth,' he might have a problem on that show. But Hollywood Squares.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the way elections work in Iraq. When you arrive at the polls, they have two boxes to choose from. You put your vote for Saddam Hussein in the one, or they put you in the other one.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today his coalition against Iraq is growing. We now have Romania on board with us. I was worried for a while there, we might have to go this alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Winona Ryder trial postponed again today because Winona just didn't show up. She didn't show up. And today Martha Stewart said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems Martha Stewart's friend Sam Waksal, the founder of ImClone, pleaded guilty today to charges of insider trading. Now facing 65 years in prison. It's kind of ironic. First he's involved in insider trading, now it looks like he's gonna be traded on the inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The estate of deceased advice columnist, Ann Landers [is ] being auctioned off. Among the items being sold are letters from then- President Jimmy Carter.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are trying to get Bill Clinton to be the center square on Hollywood Squares. Can you believe it?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Saddam Hussein, reelected to another seven-year term. Very close, he received 99% of the vote, and 1% of the vote went for last-minute candidate Frank Lautenberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is what we know about Saddam Hussein. He has apparently executed 53 relatives. Is it just me, or is it getting harder and harder to dislike this guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Iraq held national elections. The only candidate was Saddam Hussein. So far, exit polls show that Saddam is doing very well with voters who want to continue to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent of the vote. Well, that's according to Saddam's campaign manager, Jeb Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many rumors about this Saddam Hussein guy. In the paper today, they say he has a personal psychic adviser that advises him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difference between presidential elections in Iraq and elections here -- it couldn't be more obvious.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Saddam Hussein, he won the election once again. Elected himself to another seven-year term, and he celebrated quietly by shooting a brother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the big powerful show about the White House, 'The West Wing,' all about the White House?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in Iraq say that Saddam Hussein got 100 percent of the votes in his election yesterday. One hundred percent. Unfortunately, due to a complicated butterfly ballot, some people voted for Saddam Hussein when they meant to vote for Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the lawyer's claiming he got drunk for safety reasons. He said a terrorist will think twice before storming a cockpit full of mean drunks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess today President Bush flipped a coin: heads Iraq, tails North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea has admitted it has a nuclear weapons program. Their government has spent over $1 billion to develop this bomb. And they say if it works, next they may give their country indoor plumbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein has won reelection in Iraq. The vote, 11 million to 0. Wasn't that the score of the Bengals game the other night?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two people were killed in Baghdad by stray bullets that were fired up in the air during one of Saddam Hussein's victory celebrations.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a ceremony at the White House yesterday, President Bush signed a congressional resolution authorizing military force against Iraq. They say the first step of the bombing campaign: to release Madonna's movie in downtown Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met at the White House yesterday with President Bush. Everything was going great until Bush said, 'Now which side are you on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is good news. . The UN Security Council has now authorized the use of force against all telemarketers who phone during dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Florida, Governor Jeb Bush, he's in a dead heat with his Democratic opponent running for reelection in Florida for Governor. A dead heat, time to get out the crooked voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's a close race. Jeb is not worried. He's confident Florida's confused and disoriented voters will put him over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Congress passed a bill to overhaul the nation's election system. They're gonna change the whole thing. The bill calls for new voting machines, voter education programs and the elimination of the state of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see that footage yesterday of those Haitians swimming their way to freedom here in the US? Very inspiring. Which is what Florida needs right now, 200 more people who don't know how to use the voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the INS is detaining the 200 Haitians. It looks like a lot of them will be deported, but some are hoping to stay. Actually, legally, there are only three things that can keep a Haitian in the US -- a fast ball, a curve ball or a slider.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the White House press secretary changed the seating assignments for press conferences. He gave reporters from 'Time' and 'Newsweek' really bad seats.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in Los Angeles, voters will decide whether the San Fernando Valley will split from the city of Los Angeles. That's the big vote here in California. In fact today, Dr. Phil spent the entire day trying to talk the two into staying together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, we'll find out if President Bush's brother Jeb has been reelected governor of Florida. I guess we won't know until all the votes have been counted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study just out today, as many as five million votes are likely be uncounted by midnight tomorrow night. In fact, do you know what Florida calls five million uncounted votes? 'Close enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Walter Mondale running for the Senate in Minnesota. He's hoping he can do what he did when he ran for President in 1984. You know, carry one state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Ohio, some people will be going to the polls to reelect disgraced Congressman James Traficant, even though he's currently in prison. I guess they think if he's a congressman, he's already in jail. It saves a step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jail isn't that much different from Congress. In both, you serve a term. All expenses are paid by the taxpayers. And you're surrounded by fellow crooks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you're in jail, what kind of negative ads does your opponent run against you? 'James Traficant claims to be a model prisoner, but can you believe him? He claims to get time off for good behavior, can he be trusted?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials said today they will not allow cameras into the hearings this week for alleged sniper John Lee Malvo, the 17-year-old. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night for Republicans last night. In fact, according to the final tally this morning, the only Democrat still in office: Martin Sheen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today in the Caribbean, a boatload of 200 Democrats jumped overboard asking for political asylum in Haiti. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd. Yeah. You sound like President Bush when he finally did the math. We won!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news in Florida, of course, is the President's brother, Jeb Bush, he won his reelection bid for governor down there. Well, he said he was going to fix those voting machines. Did a hell of a job, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading a book on the Bush family. It's fascinating. Did you know that Jeb is considered the smart son? . Now, what does that say about the family when the smart one is named 'Jeb'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was more confusion yesterday in Florida. Apparently, during the voting a lot of people kept yelling out 'Bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You really didn't have that much choice here in California. Our governor's race is Gray Davis against Bill Simon, which is 'bore more years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Davis is dull, but his big campaign slogan was 'Vote for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole won her seat in the US Senate. She had a terrific campaign slogan: 'Don't make me stay home all day with Bob.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 70-year-old Walter Mondale, he lost in Minnesota. Too bad. I understand he had quite a victory party planned: A registered nurse was going to jump out of a giant bran muffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Walter Mondale is old, 'cause he's a fine, fine man. But today he said, had he been elected, his first order of business when he took office, bring our boys back from 'Nam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq now trying to boost tourism. They said 50,000 foreigners visit Iraq every single month. I understand over the next couple of months, over half a million Americans are expected, all dressed in green.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a day for the Republicans. First of all, congratulations to Jeb Bush. He was reelected as Florida's Governor, and things went so well for Jeb Bush they didn't have to use the crooked voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, as you can imagine, is thrilled, he's so happy he started drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a long night for the Democrats. You know your party is in trouble when your bright young star of the future is Senator Frank Lautenberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it wasn't a complete disaster for the Democrats, they did keep control of 'The West Wing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call me sentimental, but wasn't it uplifting to see Walter Mondale come out of retirement for one last ass whipping?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Old habits are hard to break. Sometime around midnight last night, Al Gore conceded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Republican candidates got themselves elected thanks to something they call the 'Bush Bounce.' Now this is not to be confused with the 'Clinton Bounce.' That will actually get you impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Jeb Bush won the election for Governor of Florida. Reportedly, President Bush was extremely pleased. Very happy about it. President Bush said, 'It was amazing, not only did Jeb win, he even got more votes than the other guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In yesterday's election, because they've had problems there, Florida used a brand new, state-of-the-art touch-screen voting system. There were some problems in Palm Beach County where older voters complained they couldn't withdraw money from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, during CBS' election coverage, Dan Rather said that one race was 'crackling like a hickory fire.' And another was as 'tight as a botox smile.' .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tuesday night, NBC aired a special 90-minute edition of 'Fear Factor,' or as the Democrats call it, the election coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge, huge win for the Republicans. See now, it's interesting. The Democrats always said they wanted to be the party of minorities. Now they are minorities.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because the election was such a disaster for the Democrats, it looks like the leader of the Democratic Party may be stepping down. But enough about Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The experts are calling this a major, major victory for President Bush. If you count the presidential election two years ago, it's really his first victory ever, so this is something to be excited about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things went so well for the Republicans, the Supreme Court took the night off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of the big propositions failed, too. In what was considered a big surprise, the state of Oklahoma voted to ban cockfighting. Well, there goes my weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada voters rejected the legalization of marijuana. The problem was, most of the supporters showed up to vote today. 'Hey, we're here. Where is everybody?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq claimed that 50,000 foreigners visit their country every month on vacations. This is what they say. . They're trying to boost tourism. In fact, they now have a new promotion on Air Iraq: 'Human shields fly free.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's take a look at some of the Iraqi tourism slogans: 'Come to Iraq -- nobody lives forever.&quot;So much to see! You'll wish you weren't wearing a blindfold.&quot;We do camel right.&quot;Come for the anthrax. Stay for the smallpox.&quot;Iraq: We're still not as rude as the French.&quot;Visit our new 'Gap for Kurds.&quot;It's like Yemen, with less dysentery.&quot;Don't forget to visit the 'Mustache Ranch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big win yesterday for the Republicans. . And now they're saying the problem was the Democrats could not articulate a message. . You know you're in trouble when you are out-articulated by President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey, he's off to Washington to represent the people of New Jersey. He said earlier he hopes to get in on some of that hot intern action. Those are the old days, Frank!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is still celebrating their party's sweep in the midterm elections. Very excited about it. President Bush was particularly happy, since these were the only midterms he's ever done well on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Nevada, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have legalized small amounts of marijuana. Opponents said that legalizing pot would have sent the wrong message to Nevada's young gamblers and prostitutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House had a great Veterans Day planned. Today, I understand that they are scheduling a parade of 250,000 veterans right through downtown Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Iraqi government began officially debating whether or not they will comply with the latest UN resolutions. And you know what a big part debate plays in Iraqi politics.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has announced that if he runs for re-election, Dick Cheney will once again be his vice presidential nominee. In fact, Cheney was so touched when he heard Bush say this, his heart stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Republicans now control everything in Washington. The House, Senate, Supreme Court, the White House. The bad news: They got no excuse. You screw up this one, it's your fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine said that George Bush lit up a cigar in the White House on election night last week after the elections. Gee, I hope it wasn't one of the cigars left over from the old Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told his staff, 'Don't be sore winners.' He told them, 'Don't gloat about the vote.' He was very specific. But you know, I think secretly he's enjoying this. Like today, he said he's ready to work with both sides of Congress, the Republicans and the Democracks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like for the first time ever, the Democratic Party is going to have a woman leader, from right here in California. The big surprise: It's not Barbra Streisand. What are the odds of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For their 25th wedding anniversary, it was revealed today that President Bush gave his wife Laura some diamond and sapphire earrings and a pair of binoculars. That's not a good sign when you give your wife jewelry, and then you got to give her binoculars to find the stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For most people, Veterans Day is a day when we recognize that this country truly is the home of the brave. Except, of course, for Winona Ryder, who thinks of it as the land of the free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN Security Council has issued a deadline of Friday for UN inspectors to be allowed to see if Jennifer Lopez really got a ring from Ben Affleck or not.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi parliament rejected the UN arms resolution. They rejected it outright. Boy, who could have seen that coming?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said they will leave the final decision up to their fearless leader, Saddam Hussein, who could not be reached because he was hiding in his bunker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another Osama bin Laden tape has surfaced. It's just in time for the holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, CNN said this new tape is proof that Osama bin Laden is alive. Oh, please. What does CNN know? They still think Larry King is alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A plane carrying eight Cubans landed in Florida yesterday. Immigration officials are interviewing the Cubans to determine if they want political asylum in America. Gee, I wonder what they'll say. 'No, we're just here for a day of shopping, a quick vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cuban government is very upset, not so much about the defections, but that they stole a government plane to defect in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cubans said they only took the plane because they couldn't get the inner tubes of the wheels to float over in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ellis Island closed its doors this week in 1954. This is the place where we used to process immigrants coming into the country. Of course, that was back in the days when we used to actually process immigrants coming into the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The few remaining Democrats, they roam free throughout California. It's a protected state for them. So please, don't poke them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing how quickly the news changes, isn't it? It's hard to believe just 10 days ago, we believed Osama bin Laden was dead and the Democratic Party was alive. Now the whole thing is turned around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're now saying this latest Osama bin Laden audiotape is real. . I guess the proof is now he's bragging about all the recent evil things he's done. He's trying to take credit. Like now he claims he's the one that whacked Ralphie last Sunday&quot; [on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are against this upcoming war. Today, Cardinal Bernard 'Above The' Law in Boston.is now challenging the wisdom of a military strike in Iraq. The Cardinal says yes, he knows that Saddam Hussein is evil, but he suggests we just transfer him to another parish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a happier note, over the weekend, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, you know the guy you always see standing up -- he's been on our show, nice man -- married a White House staff member. You know where the couple is registered? Target. That's when you know the economy is bad, when Republicans are registered at Target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, don't confuse them with Saddam Hussein, who's registered as a target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal officials have approved the sale of a heart defibrillator that people can keep in their home. . Boy, how many of these is Dick Cheney going to get for Christmas, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this guy was dead or just retired, Osama bin Laden, because you hadn't heard anything...in a condo somewhere, given up. Now they say there's a new tape from Osama bin Laden and they're pretty certain that this tape was made recently, and it's chilling. I mean he says unbelievable things. For example, he takes credit for the Winona Ryder Saks Fifth Avenue robbery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason that they think it was made recently is because he does mention Ben and J. Lo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in the tape he's angry, he's complaining about spending nine bucks to see 'Jackass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Pantoliano is on the show tonight. You know he played Ralphie on the Sopranos, and last week he was decapitated. Which means he has got the most famous head since the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein has agreed to allow UN inspectors back in Iraq. It's interesting, it wasn't the threat of war that changed his mind. You know what it was? A last-minute phone call from Dr. Phil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Bush should do? Send along a couple of security guards from Saks Fifth Avenue. Those guys can find anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Senate voted themselves a pay raise. Don't you wish you could do that? Go into work and say, 'Maybe it's time I got a raise. Let's vote on it. What do you think, self? Yes, it's unanimous!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like the Democratic Senate is going, 'Hey, maybe this Republican- controlled Congress thing is not so bad. Free raises for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today the Democrats have selected Boston, Massachusetts, as the site of their 2004 Democratic convention. But they did say, 'Shh, don't tell Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The convention will be in Boston in September. This way the Democrats and the Red Sox can face mathematical elimination together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Internal Revenue Service says they're unable to give back $80 million because they don't have the addresses of the 96,000 people they owe the money to. . Isn't that amazing? They can't find you when they owe you money -- you come up $20 short, they've got bounty hunters, private detectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time, the Federal Government has begun raiding the nation's 17,000 nursing homes. This week, '60 Minutes' sent a crew to do a story on one of the nursing homes. . After they were done filming, the nursing home staff wouldn't let Mike Wallace leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those living in New York City are in the middle of a financial crisis, a fiscal crisis. Budget problems, hardly any money. I'm tell you how bad it is today. Earlier today, Mayor Bloomberg announced the city would lay off two million rats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A political expert predicts that a war with Iraq would only last two or three months. That's pretty good. Actually, the exact estimate was two to three months, or the length of a Jennifer Lopez marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech yesterday, President Bush said he will not tolerate deception, denial or deceit from Saddam Hussein. Yeah, then afterwards the President told his speechwriter, 'I haven't seen that many Ds since high school.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Democratic National Committee announced it's chosen Boston as the site for the 2004 convention. Going to be in Boston. Yeah, I think it's perfect. A perfect match because neither the Democrats nor the Red Sox can win in the fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the UN sanctions, Iraq must supply an accurate and honest accounting of all their weapons. An honest and accurate accounting. Good luck, we can't even get that from WorldCom and Enron. Good luck getting it from Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nation's Catholic bishops said today they are against war with Iraq. Well, you can see why the Catholic bishops would be against it. They don't want our boys going overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, just got married.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at Miami Airport...an alert screener stopped a passenger who had a 12-inch meat cleaver in his carry-on bag.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Point Reyes, California, 50 women protested the pending war with Iraq by lying on the ground naked and spelling out the word 'peace' with their naked bodies. Right idea, wrong president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read something interesting today about President Bush. Do you know in his desk in the Oval Office, he keeps a paper with a picture of the most wanted Al Qaeda members on it? And whenever we capture or kill one of them, he crosses them out. Clinton used to do the same thing with the 'Sports Illustrated' swimsuit issue. Whenever he'd nail one, he'd put a line through it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton was here in southern California over the weekend playing in a pro-am golf tournament. On the 18th hole, Clinton hit a spectator with his second shot right in the chest. Isn't that amazing? Four years later, still having trouble with his aim. The guy is unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Dick Cheney very upset about that oil tanker that went down off the coast of Spain. ... It's an oil spill twice the size of the Exxon Valdez. In fact, today, Cheney and Bush sent flowers to the head of the oil company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has agreed this week to consider whether death row inmates who had bad lawyers should get a second chance. I think we should give the inmates a second chance, but execute the lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Federal judge has ordered Alabama to remove a monument with the Ten Commandments on it from the state's judicial building. It's a state building.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an article in US News and World Report this week, friends of Puff Daddy, now known as P. Diddy, claim he may run for president. ... Imagine him as president. Iraq would have to start sending weapons inspectors over here now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush was meeting with a lot of dignitaries. He met with&quot; Nobel Prize winner John Fen &quot;and he asked him if he could come up with some chemistry between Dick Cheney and Colin Powell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein, in case of war now, he is smuggling his family into Libya when the bombing starts. That's what he is going to do. ... Coincidentally I have made the same arrangements for my family if I ever host the Academy Awards again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Roger Ailes, who's the head of the Fox News Network, is denying reports that he sent President Bush a letter, giving him advice on the war.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study by National Geographic, 77 percent of young Americans can't find Iraq on a map. But that's okay, because in a couple of months, even Saddam Hussein won't be able to find Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, the Bushes lit the national Christmas tree. And they always say the same thing. They always say, 'This isn't the Bushes' Christmas tree. Oh no, this is a national Christmas tree that belongs to all Americans.' . See how far you get trying to hang an ornament on 'your' Christmas tree. 'Mayday! Intruder, intruder! Get him down. Get him down!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq has handed in their weapons report. The only thing they left out, of course, the weapons. This whole report is 12,000 pages long. What the government is trying to prove, they're trying to prove that Saddam Hussein is lying. Hey, good luck. We couldn't even prove O.J. was lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to his senior military officers, Saddam Hussein declared that in the event of war, Iraq's enemies will be defeated and humiliated. Believe me, when it comes to being defeated and humiliated in war, Hussein knows what he's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 100 Hollywood celebrities have sent a letter to President Bush asking him not to attack Iraq, which is amazing to me. I didn't think we had 100 celebrities who weren't either in jail or rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is patiently waiting for his three-page summary of the 10,000-page Iraqi weapons report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week Saddam Hussein releases this big 10,000-page report about nuclear and biological weapons and whether they got them or not. It's big, 10,000 pages, or as George Bush refers to it, a doorstop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saddam Hussein, you know, he's nuts. . He is also wily and now he is pretending like he's a nice guy. Like he apologized to Kuwait and earlier today he resigned from Augusta National Golf Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the new Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Snow, resigned from Augusta National Golf Club. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Qaeda has issued new threats against the US. They say we're not safe on land, sea, or in the air. Well, I think Amtrak, Carnival cruise ships and United Airlines took care of that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;United Airlines has filed for bankruptcy after the US government refused to guarantee them a loan. See, taxpayer money is very short now, because we have to continue sending military aid to our good friends, the Saudis. We can't help our own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;United Airlines said even though they are bankrupt, they're telling customers not to worry because it's going to be business as usual. Isn't that how they got in trouble in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to former President Jimmy Carter. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to try and convince Trent Lott that the Civil War was over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott in a lot of trouble -- this is really stupid -- for saying America would have been better off if it had elected pro- segregation candidate Strom Thurmond back in 1948. I tell you now, his face is as red as his neck. He is so embarrassed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he still doesn't get it. Like to say he was going to apologize. In fact, he said he would apologize to both blacks and whites separately, but equally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new study out about happiness, and they found that financial success, strong business competitiveness, and a surplus of money worked against happiness. They said success and money will not make you happy. See, that's the Bush economic plan: to make us all happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, at US Central Command, hundreds of our military people are sitting in front of computer screens going through a cyber-rehearsal for war. . They're figuring out every possible scenario on their computers, and they say it would take about 10 days to win the war on the computer. Actually, the actual war will only takes six days to win, because there won't be any stupid pop-up ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The news networks are going to have a big, big problem on their hands. What if President Bush declares war on Iraq the same day Jennifer Lopez gets married? Are there enough reporters for both these stories? And which one do you lead with?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cardinal Law made a trip to the Vatican this week to discuss these scandals with the Pope. . He doesn't need advice from the Pope. He needs advice from Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dialogue out of Washington getting tougher and tougher, and bringing us closer and closer to war with Iraq every day. But see, it's Iraq's own fault for giving Bush a 12,000-page report to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a lot easier for Bush just to invade rather than trying to read 12,000 pages.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Supreme Court this week is going to decide once and for all whether to outlaw cross burning when it is used to intimidate and threaten people. You know, as opposed to the fun, family cross burnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may outlaw cross burnings. More bad news for Trent Lott. This is not his week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent, or, as they're now calling him in the Senate, the 'Great White Dope.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent Lott has come under fire for comments he made at Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party. Let me tell you, that's not good. When you can stand next to the guy who's 100, and you look worse, that's bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One Republican leader said, 'What Trent Lott did was a mistake of the mouth and not of the heart.' And today Clinton said, 'Why didn't I think of that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Trent Lott met with his spiritual adviser. The bad news is it's Cardinal Bernard Law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;United Airlines gave their employees their big Christmas bonus today. Each employee got five minutes to rifle through someone's luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Winona Ryder began her community service this week in which she was ordered to work helping the blind. So apparently, she's joining Bush's new economic team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush introduced his new economic adviser, Steven Friedman. And Dick Cheney says he thinks Friedman will be an excellent choice. Bob Dole applauded the choice of Friedman. And Trent Lott said, 'Friedman? That's a Jewish name, isn't it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in a run of bad luck. . Every year we have the NAACP Man of the Year office pool, you draw it and see who is going to win the NAACP Man of the Year. This year, I get Trent Lott.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very excited because our President this year is mailing out a million Christmas cards. . It's a beautiful winter scene and it depicts Santa Claus, and he's there in his workshop with the elves and it's snowing and he's at the North Pole and it's surrounded by oil rigs. It's beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A million Christmas cards. It's not as much fun at the White House when all the interns are doing is licking stamps.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who do you think has the better chance of still being around in January, Saddam Hussein or Trent Lott?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Bush is criticizing Lott for his controversial statement. That's when you know you're in trouble, when Bush is attacking you for misspeaking.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More information came out today about Trent Lott's segregationist past. Forty years ago at Ole Miss, he led the battle to keep blacks out of his fraternity, Phi Beta Cracker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Lott is still a member of an all-white fraternity. It's called the US Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Jesse Helms came to Trent Lott's defense. That's who you want standing by you, defending you, that you're not a segregationist -- Jesse Helms. 'Apparently, the Imperial Wizard's not available; let's get Jesse down here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' Lott defends himself by saying he has hired black interns. . There's a good defense: Hiring black people to work for free. Isn't that what the Civil War was all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Trent Lott held his fourth 'I'm really sorry' press conference. He's now saying at Strom Thurmond's birthday party when he made those remarks, those words were not prepared. He was just winging it. Right winging it, but winging it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government officials still poring over Saddam Hussein's weapons report. You see, it's 12,000 pages, this huge thing. Why does it take 12,000 pages just to say you have no weapons? . It's like an essay question in school where you don't know the answer and you just keep writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A minor setback today for the UN inspectors: They had to wait two hours outside a locked door. These Iraqi officials, they're very smart. They go, 'We're wrapping presents. Don't come in yet. Hang on. We'll be ready in a minute. You don't want to ruin the surprise.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is going to host 'Saturday Night Live.' The network figures that if everyone who didn't buy his book tunes in, it'll be huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, another fantastic Christmas special -- an angel comes down to earth and shows Trent Lott what the country would have been like if Strom Thurmond became President. Wonderful for the whole family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent Lott says the remarks were a mistake of the head, not the heart. I want to tell you something: the rabid squirrel head-piece you're wearing, that's a mistake of the head. If you know what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Saddam Hussein guy, he's nuts, right? . But there are reports now -- here is what this guy is doing. He is growing anthrax at his house and he is cultivating anthrax at his house. He is using that. He is going to get back at his enemies. When he is done growing anthrax at his house -- no wait a minute, no, that's Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent Lott got in trouble last week for statements he made at what's turning out to be his retirement party. Apparently, he had no idea at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has spent the last week apologizing to every African American he sees. He's just trying too hard. Like today at the White House, he saw Condoleezza Rice, he said, 'You go, girl!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time he's come out, he's just apologizing. He wants people to know he's really apologizing, he's not just 'whistling Dixie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, Trent Lott appeared on BET, the Black Entertainment network. Of course, these days, for a lot of folks, Trent Lott is black entertainment. It's a new show on BET called 'Cracker Talk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Trent Lott appeared using his rap name, 'Old Racist Bastard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore shocked the nation yesterday by announcing he will not run for president in 2004. The bad news: Now he has time to write another book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched him on Saturday Night Live? He did a great job. Very funny. . The show got huge ratings. Ratings were high in New York, high in California, high in Texas. Florida is still counting. We're still waiting for Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friends say one of the reasons Al Gore decided not to run for president is he's making a lot of money giving speeches. Did you know he gets $100,000 a speech? He gets $100,000 a speech and he lost the election. It's a good thing George Bush won. Can you imagine if Bush had to rely on his speaking to make money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of changes going on in the White House. Like President Bush's new military adviser, Sean Penn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sean Penn is in Iraq trying his hand at diplomacy. As you know, he was trained for this mission at Port Streisand, out in Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Iraqi officials praised the professionalism of the UN weapons inspection team. This is part of Iraq's new strategy called 'Operation Kiss Ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see what happened in Iraq on Friday? The UN inspectors had to stop working for two hours because a door was locked. Well, it's good to see they're not letting anything stand in their way over there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has asked Osama bin Laden to quit associating himself with the PLO. How embarrassing is that for bin Laden? That's like the Klan telling Trent Lott, 'Shut up, will you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They now apparently have Osama bin Laden on tape making some anti-Semitic remarks. So he may be asked to step down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were off last week, so I missed a lot of the news. Wasn't paying attention. Like today, I came in and said to someone, 'Hey, when do you think the war will begin?' And they said, 'Which one?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that his new tax proposal will be fair. It will be fair for all incomes. See, the way it works is, the more income you have, the fairer it will be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush once again getting tough with Iraq. He said today we have to stop Saddam Hussein from playing hide and seek with his weapons. Hey, we can't even stop Michael Jackson from playing hide and seek with his weapons.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, we are currently at what level? We are at orange. We're at orange, which is 'high alert.' Did you know that? Orange alert. Doesn't that sound like some new fruit drink with extra caffeine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand this whole stupid color system. They always have to explain what the color means, right? Like the announcer comes on and says, 'We're now at level orange.' And then they say, 'Orange means 'high alert.&quot; Why not just say, 'We're at high alert?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you say, 'We're at high alert,' does everybody go, 'High alert? Wait a minute! What color is that?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today, 'The goal of these terrorists is to inflict economic chaos on the US.' Economic chaos. Well, good luck in California. You have to go a long way to beat our own Governor Gray Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen this Muslim cleric guy on TV? The guy's name is Abu Hamza. Anyway, the guy has got one eye and two hooks for hands. He's got one eye and two hooks. And he's on TV, and he says, 'All the bad things that have happened to America are signs from God.' He says, 'It's God's way of punishing us.' Really? What do you call having one eye and two hooks for hands?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iraq said today they approved the use of spy planes by the UN. I'm sorry, how secretive are these spy planes if we have to get permission from Iraq to fly them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Colorado, state legislators there announced they want to change the legal status of cats and dogs from 'property' to 'companions.' Dog and cat would be a companion rather than property. Very similar to legislation in North Korea, where they changed the status of cats and dogs from 'appetizer' to 'entree.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think that Yao Ming may have had an advantage in the NBA All-Star selection -- you know that whole thing? 'Cause people in China can vote now on the Internet. In fact, they thought that might be the case after the first day of voting, when Ming was ahead by over 1 billion votes. In fact, Al Gore said today, 'Why didn't I think of that? I gave money to the Chinese. I should have had them vote for me. I would have been President today.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you aware of the fact that it's Fashion Week here in New York City? Yeah. Well now, you can't tell by looking at you folks, but it's fashion week in New York, and the city is on lavender alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the Westminster Kennel Club dog show at Madison Square Garden. ... And you have dogs from all over the world are participating in the Kennel Club show. Except for the French poodles and the German shepherd, they're refusing to participate, they don't want any part of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like we've moved a step closer to war. Not with Iraq -- with France and Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to President Bush, you know what the real target of these terrorists is? Our economy. They want to target our economy. This is where Bush is smart. In the last few years, he's made the economy so bad, they could never hit a target that small.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said if Iraq gets rid of Saddam Hussein, we'll help the Iraqi people with food, medical supplies, housing, education, anything that's needed. ... He finally comes up with a domestic plan. Okay, it's for Iraq, but still, it's a start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell announced there is a new Osama bin Laden tape. Well, sure. It's the middle of sweeps, they always come out with this stuff. Al Jazeera is like every other network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we are in a Code Orange, so stock up on oranges. Is that what that means?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security officials said everyone should have a roll of duct tape and plastic sheeting to protect your house in the event of a terrorist attack. A roll of plastic sheet. Who came up with this idea, MacGyver?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If plastic is so good at stopping radiation, why does it melt when I put it in the microwave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the price of gas? Over two dollars a gallon now in California. ... That means if you drive an SUV, your kids are not going to college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, an audiotape was released allegedly from Osama bin Laden. It tells the Iraqi people not to give up, and that they will succeed. ... Experts say the voice was either Osama bin Laden or Tony Robbins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know we're on orange alert. It's really paying off. They rounded up that stoned Dell guy. The alert is really paying off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, are you aware of the fact that it's fashion week? ... It's a big deal. It's designers from all over the world -- with the exception of France and Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Academy Awards this year, by the way will, be televised live to 113 nations. All of which hate us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the big finales are coming up on TV in the next week. We got the finale of 'The Bachelorette' on ABC. You got the big finale of 'Joe Millionaire' on Fox. Of course, CNN, hopefully, the big finale of 'Saddam Hussein.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Military experts said today that part of the plan during the first wave of attacks on Iraq is to use bombs to destroy the Baghdad transportation system, render it totally useless. You know, the same thing a quarter inch of rain does here in Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This rain has been unbelievable. ... That's what I love about Los Angeles. On Friday, the government increases us to a high alert. People are going, 'I'm not going to let the terrorists bother me. I don't give a damn about that.' Two days later, three drops of rain -- 'Run for your lives! It's raining! Run for your lives!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Department of Homeland Security, now asking civilians to develop their own emergency plans for a terrorist attack. So basically, what we've done here, we've created the Department of Homeland Security to tell us, 'Hey, you're screwed. You're on your own. Good luck.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But people are getting into it. In fact, a new store opened just down the street from me -- 'Duct Tape, Batteries, and Beyond.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what they told us, yesterday -- to buy duct tape and plastic sheeting to cover our houses. This is 'homeland security.' Sounds more like Home Depot security, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government said today if you're caught outside near the explosion of a radioactive bomb, do not panic. Lie down on the ground and cover your head. And if you can stay in this position for 14.2 million years, you'll be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of American anti-war activists now are in Turkey, and they've received visas to enter Iraq where they will act as human shields to event an attack. You know who I feel sorry for? The people who got turned down for this job. 'I'm sorry. We don't feel you have what it takes to be a human shield.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But luckily, France and Germany still say they are our allies. You know, the same way Bill and Hillary are man and wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City is on an Orange Alert. Today, Mom and I spend the entire day duct taping windows and stockpiling malt liquor. So we're ready to go if anything happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another one of those creepy audiotapes from Osama bin Laden. ... And experts think that it's recent, because in the tape Osama bin Laden expresses his disappointment that Richard Gere was not nominated for 'Chicago.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Things I, Saddam Hussein, Want To Get Off My Chest: 10. I Don't have links to Al Qaeda, but the same guy does our taxes. 9. Of my 24 palaces, 19 are just timeshares. 8. Kim Jong Il cheats at Scrabble. 7. I bought most of my medals on eBay. 6. You know what I use to lighten up leftovers? Anthrax. 5. Sometimes even I confuse Iran and Iraq. 4. Is it just me, or does it seem like Michael Jackson is weird? 3. Christiane Amanpour, call me. 2. Try to find a parking space in downtown Baghdad -- now that's torture, am I right, people? 1. I can't prove it, but I think Hans Blix took a leak in my pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest tape, bin Laden is calling for the destruction of America, opposition to the war in the Middle East, and labels our government 'evil crusaders.' Oh, that's not bin Laden. That was the President of France.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some members of Congress are so upset about this thing with France that they want to impose trade sanctions against French products. ... They want to ban French products like Perrier and Evian. You thought Hollywood celebrities were against the war before, oh my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate and Senator John Kerry is recovering nicely after having his prostate removed. ... But the doctors did tell him it would be seven months before he could be sexually active again. And to their credit, all of the other Democratic candidates have been very supportive. Joe Lieberman called to wish him the best. The Reverend Al Sharpton called to offer prayers. Former President Bill Clinton called Mrs. Kerry to ask if she was lonely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You guys all set for Valentine's Day? ... You know a lot of guys who forgot are going, 'Honey, I didn't forget. Look, I got you duct tape and plastic sheeting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The officials at the national security office have sent out an advisory telling us to stock up on duct tape and plastic sheeting. This means the only people who are gonna survive an attack are serial killers. Who else has duct tape and plastic sheeting in their car?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the Bush Administration announced that the first thing they would do during an attack on Iraq is destroy Iraq's transportation system. That's what they said they would do. As a result, they'll be blowing up all New York City taxicabs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the orange alert, it means you have to stock up on duct tape and plastic sheeting. I was in the hardware store after I got off the subway this morning. Stocked up on the stuff and said, 'That reminds me of my wedding night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some members of Congress now are so upset with the French government and their lack of support for us, they want to impose a trade restriction against French products, like Evian water, Perrier water. And today, President Bush, he agreed with that. But I don't think Bush quite understands it. Like he said today, starting tomorrow, he's gonna begin by banning the import of French toast and French fries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Paris over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people attended a big anti-war rally, the biggest one since World War II. In fact, there were so many protesters that when they marched through the Arc de Triomphe, out of force of habit the French government surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge...now says no reason to panic over this high alert thing. Remember last week, we went to orange, high alert? He says that may have been a false alarm. Great, now he tells me, after I Saran-wrapped my entire house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found a good use for my leftover duct tape. What I do is, when CNN is on, I put a strip of it across the bottom of my TV so I don't have to read that stupid news ticker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bill Clinton said today he now regrets not nailing Osama bin Laden when he had the chance. He also regrets not nailing a flight attendant named Heather [and a] cocktail waitress named Missy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie over the weekend, 'Daredevil.' $43 million, did huge, 'Daredevil.' It's about a blind man working against evil. Actually, original title was, 'Hans Blix: Weapons Inspector.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The admiral in charge of the USS Kitty Hawk battle group has been relieved of his command for having an inappropriate relationship with a female officer. And today in his defense he said, 'Hey, it's not just a job. It's an adventure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

If the US invades, Saddam would like us to do it in March, after the Baghdad Tulip Show. 4. Entire interview was Saddam demonstrating a low-impact aerobic workout. 3.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on '60 Minutes II,' Dan Rather conducted an exclusive interview with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ... Probably the most surprising part of the interview was when Saddam said, 'I am Peter Pan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that after attacking Iraq, we will send its citizens millions of dollars worth of medicine and food. Bush then added, and if it works in Iraq, we might try something like that here in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Saddam Hussein...owns part of the company that publishes 'Elle' Magazine. Actually, it's kind of obvious because this month's cover story is 'How to Please Your Dictator in the Sack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news on the situation with Iraq. Seems Mexico's finally coming over to the US side. In fact, this marks the first time Mexico's come over to the US side without actually coming over to the US side.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq has agreed in principle to destroy their missiles. You know why they say it's 'in principle?' It sounds a lot better than 'in your dreams.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government now figures the cost of the war, the cost of doing this whole Iraqi war, will be about $320 per citizen. Of course, that's just for your basic war. If you want your deluxe package...it's gonna be a few extra bucks more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the saddest thing about that whole interview with Saddam Hussein? He actually came off more normal than Michael Jackson and Robert Blake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A sex therapist from Florida today said she's analyzed Saddam Hussein, and she thinks that he would be very selfish in bed, that he would focus only on his own pleasure and ignore his partner's needs. So in other words, he's a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;22 government agencies will officially move into the new Homeland Security building, tomorrow. I guess they had some trouble getting into the building today. Apparently it's all covered with plastic sheeting and duct tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Kucinich announced -- he's the former mayor of Cleveland - announced he is running for president. And so far, he's leading the Democratic candidates in the 'worst hair' category.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story, you probably heard. One of the masterminds behind the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, has been arrested. It's a big story, hell of a job. He is described as the CEO of Al Qaeda. That's two things to be happy about. Not only do we arrest a high-ranking member of the Al Qaeda, we also get to torture a CEO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And everything has been written about this guy. He considers himself a ladies' man who likes to party. And you can certainly tell by, look, show his picture from today, there's a good-looking guy. Talk about your George Clooney look alike.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like the Al Qaeda version of Nick Nolte, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We captured him while he was asleep. You see that back hair? I don't think he was sleeping, I think he was hibernating, that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how we get this guy to talk? You know all that duct tape we have been hoarding -- apply strips of it to his back and then rip it off till he tells you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all have a nice weekend? You know, my wife, she wanted to go someplace expensive this weekend, so I took her to the Texaco station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess this week wholesale oil prices surged to the highest level in 12 years. They hit $39.99 a barrel. And they said on the news tonight the fear is that it could go to $40 a barrel. Yeah, you think? Gee, what are the odds of that? A penny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, experts say we get into an extended war with Iraq, the price of oil could reach $80 a barrel and then the cost after the war, it would be free. Figure that out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush called war with Iraq his last option. Reporters asked him how many other options there were. He said that's the only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Iraq has started the process of destroying the missiles they didn't have. They've destroyed ten missiles yesterday and eight more today. Bush may be the smartest military guy in history. He's waiting till he destroys all their weapons and then we declare war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest intelligence reports, Saddam Hussein may have numerous mistresses all over Baghdad. A married man with numerous mistresses. No wonder the French didn't want to go after him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hollywood celebrities continuing to speak out. The West Wing's Martin Sheen has a commercial on the air criticizing the war. Law &amp; Order's Fred Thompson has an ad on the air supporting the President. You know, I think I speak for most Americans when I say before I weigh in with my opinion, I want to hear what Carrot Top has to say before I actually join in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and remember those people who went to Iraq to be human shields against the bombs and the missiles? Remember those people? Well, a group of them from London said they're coming home because of safety concerns. Safety. You get the feeling they didn't quite grasp the idea of the human shield? Just the name, human shield, isn't that a tip off? There might be some safety issues involved?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a member of the Canadian Parliament named Carolyn Parrish says that she hates Americans and that we are 'bastards.' So I'm guessing she must be French Canadian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are new reports out today that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il, has invited Saddam Hussein to come and stay in his country, or as the Pentagon was calling it, 'Operation Kill Two Birds With One Stone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, listen to this. Some of the airports here in California, they're so broke they're going to use Ebay to sell off the confiscated items they've taken from people at security checkpoints. Here's a great chance to pick up 400,000 used toenail clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Georgia Senator Zell Miller has angrily demanded that CBS cancel plans for its Beverly Hillbillies reality show. He says it demeans and makes fun of hillbillies. In fact, he says he doesn't even like the term hillbilly because hillbilly is derogatory. He feels they should be called 'inbred Americans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has been described as a lady's man. That's what they said. In fact, he once appeared on Al Jazeera reality show, 'Joe Million Hairs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest rumor is Mexico may vote against us when the next UN resolution -- our next door neighbor. See, I don't like to resort to threats. I think we should play tough with Mexico on this one. We should seal up our borders. This way none of those people would be able to go back home to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after offering Turkey billions and billions of dollars to use their air bases, their parliament voted not to let us in. In fact, President Bush is so mad, listen to this, he is so mad at Turkey, he's thinking about canceling Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, oh, oh, kind of an embarrassing moment for Saddam Hussein yesterday. I don't know if you saw this. He called President Bush 'a tyrant who enslaves people and besieges their freedom.' And then one of his aides came up to him and said, 'No, I'm sorry. You're reading the wrong card. That is your introduction.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more news on that Al Qaeda terrorist guy they captured, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. You see this guy? Look at this big fat guy here. And this is the guy who wants women to cover up? Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how they captured him? Rang his bell at 3:30 in the morning and said, 'Pizza guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, you know, there is something hypocritical about a fat terrorist, okay? It's true. This guy is telling his followers, 'Sacrifice your lives. Be disciplined, join the war, kill the infidels.' And then he's going, 'Yeah, I'll have a double hummus burger, small goat on a stick and a diet coke.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess a lot of students around the country protested the war today. The national -- what is it? I think it's called youth and student peace coalition. They sponsored an antiwar organization called 'Books, not Bombs.' Today, President Bush said, 'Why would we want to drop books on them? We'd have to hit them right on the head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It came out today that one of the interpreters hired by CBS for the Dan Rather-Saddam Hussein interview, I don't know if you saw that the other night, apparently adopted a fake Arabic accent for the interview. They hired an actor. . You know, CBS should have hired someone to do Dan Rather's voice. Maybe he would have asked tougher questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I love the way people overreact. A man was arrested today, in New York for wearing a T-shirt at the mall that said, 'Give peace a chance.' Guy's walking around. Just says 'Give peace a chance.' He's in the food court. Two mall security guards come up to him. 'Take off the shirt.' They arrest him for wearing the shirt. Is this unbelievable? Well, thank God we have brave mall security policemen, willing to put their lives on the line for this kind of thing. Thank you, Barney Fife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the front page story in USA Today. American tourists in Paris, now, are reportedly being yelled at, attacked and spit upon by the French. Well, thank God, things are getting back to normal over there. Thank God. I was so worried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, listen to this, France, Germany, China and Turkey all came out against President Bush's plan to attack Iraq. Yeah, all of them. Yeah, yeah, as a result, President Bush has decided to bomb Epcot Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Saddam Hussein, I guess, was giving a speech to his people, and he said that President Bush wants to capture the Arab people and use them to do their cheap labor. That's what he told them. Yeah, after hearing is, President Bush said, 'We would never do that. We're too close to Mexico.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems Saddam Hussein has written his autobiography. It's called 'Men and the City.' And it's a shame he didn't wait a couple more weeks so we could see how it finally ends. Came out a little too soon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, continuing to get all the advice he can on finding a staging area for our troops. I understand today he called the Turkey hotline. He got a little confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US Military officials say the war plan for Iraq calls for us to drop 3,000 precision-guided bombs on the Iraqi leadership in the first 48 hours. Here's my question. If they're really precision-guided, why do we need 3,000 of them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said 90% of these smart bombs that we drop can find Iraq on a map all by themselves. Pretty amazing, when you realize only 10% of Americans can find Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, there's no question that big load we captured the other night, what was his name, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, you know, the Al Qaeda guy. We got his picture. Look at this guy. Look at this guy's picture. You know, I'm thinking of a great way to torture this guy. Do they still make that Epilady?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I don't think it's going to be hard getting this guy to talk. I think this guy would give up Osama bin Laden in exchange for Sara Lee!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Qatar yesterday, they had the Islamic unity summit, which is supposed to bring all the Arab nations together. It turned into just a huge fight. The Vice President of Iraq called the Kuwaiti diplomat a monkey. He yelled at him, he goes, 'Shut up, you monkey!' Then he said, 'I curse your moustache.' Doesn't that sound like something you'd say when you can't think of anything to say?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Treasury Department announced today a new plan to start adding color to the $20 bill to make it more attractive. That sounds like a Republican response to a bad economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;60 Minutes has hired Bill Clinton and Bob Dole to appear weekly in a point/counterpoint type segment, where they'll debate two sides of an issue. Why do they even need Dole? Clinton likes to waffle. He could do both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for? Leslie Stahl. She spent half the day keeping Clinton off of her and the other half of the day trying to keep Bob Dole from showing her how the Viagra works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Dole's doing a lot of TV. Signed a deal with CBS. Next month he's gonna play a corpse on 'CSI.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our old friend Monica Lewinsky, God bless her, back in the news. Things are not going well for Monica.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush held a prime time news conference in a time slot where people would normally watch 'Friends.' Most 'Friends' viewers say they didn't notice because they thought President Bush was 'Joey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin, I want you to know I'm doing this monologue with or without the support of the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush today agreed to allow more weapons inspectors into Iraq. I understand he's got 250,000 of them ready to go.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turkey has voted not to allow US troops into their country. Today Saddam Hussein said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, still trying to get the support of Mexico when we go to Iraq. And not so much as a fighting force. He's hoping that Mexico will at least supply advisers. you know, teach us how to slip into the borders at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein has written his autobiography, it's called 'Men and the City.' And here's the shocker, the reviewers in Baghdad loved it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's great about our country, this is absolutely true. I'm watching CNN today, and they're covering the debate at the UN. Colin Powell is there. Every major world leader is making speeches, debating whether we should go to war, and then at the bottom of the screen it says, 'CNN breaking news, Cher's stolen wig has been recovered.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll indicated that if the elections were held today, President Bush would lose the popular vote. Oh, he'd still win the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pakistan claimed today they have arrested two of Osama bin Laden's sons. . I was thinking about it. You know, in a situation like this, where the kids have been arrested, you have to ask yourself, where were the parents?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden is said to have 50 kids and you know who I feel sorry for? That 25th child. . It's always hard for the middle kid to get noticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of controversy about the interrogation of this Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. . As part of the way they can break them, they can strip- search him and shave off all his body hair. I'm thinking, now, 'How bad do you have to screw up at spy school to get this job?' . All the other spies are gambling at the casinos, you know, they're driving fast cars, meeting lots of beautiful women. You're body waxing a big fat guy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In London, it seems an 85-year-old woman has had the words 'do not resuscitate' tattooed across her chest. She said if her heart stopped, she wants doctors to do nothing, just let her die. Today the Republicans said, 'That's the kind of change we need in our Medicare program.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Man! What a crowd. You sound like Saddam Hussein watching France at the UN. Yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, have you heard the latest? You know, our allies of evil, France, I guess the French foreign minister flew to Africa to persuade Angola, Guinea and Cameroon to drop their support for the US, which has got to be a relief for Saddam Hussein. He just has to fight the US and the British forces. He doesn't have to sweat out Cameroon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the British ambassador to the UN has proposed to the, well, I guess he presented it to the Security Council, a proposal to give Saddam Hussein until March 17th to comply with weapons inspections or face military action. So it looks like the Irish aren't the only ones getting bombed on St. Patrick's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-righteous China also said today they are against the use of force unless it's by a tank on a college student in Tiananmen Square. Other than that, they are against the use of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that President Bush spent several evenings last week and most of the weekend calling world leaders, asking them for support. See, that's when you know the economy is bad. When the President of the US has to wait till the weekend or after 6:00 to make his long distance calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush's approval rating has fallen again this week. They say in the next election, there's a good chance it could cost him the popular vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. The government of Iraq claims that over 50,000 foreigners visit their country every month for vacation. You know, how bad is your life if going to Baghdad seems like a vacation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's got to be a terrific slide show for the neighbors. 'Okay, there's another picture of the wife and me standing next to the 40-foot high mural of Saddam Hussein. Here's another one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, on CNN they said that after the war there's a plan to divide Iraq into three parts. It would be regular, premium and unleaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You bought gas in California, is it unbelievable? Is it $2.60 a gallon in some places? In fact, now, instead of changing the prices, the gas station owners, they just move the decimal point over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new warning from the Surgeon General today. It said, 'Do not mix Nyquil with the Clinton/Dole debate on &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; it could be fatal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that? Was that boring last night? Even Al Gore said it was boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm surprised it was boring. I mean, a guy who is on Viagra versus a guy who is Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;90-year-old Rosa Parks, the woman credited with starting the civil rights movement, may attend this year's Academy Awards. Pretty exciting. But, you know, it's got to be a tough call for the seat fillers at the Academy Awards, you know? Let's say Rosa Parks gets up to go to the bathroom. Do you take her seat? You don't want to do that. See, you can't take her seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi Goldberg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you can see, for the first time this show is in color. Thank you. I guess I should say 'Hello, America, I'm your host, Condoleezza Rice.' But I won't, because that sounds like a disease. Sounds like, 'What you got?&quot;I got Condoleezza, girl!'&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi Goldberg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did anybody see the Clinton/Dole debate last night on &quot;60 Minutes?' You didn't see it? Child, you should have brought out your duct tape. This is when you knew you needed it.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi Goldberg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's '60 Minutes,' the only show that could call on Bob Dole to bring in a younger audience. That's what's scary to me, you know.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi Goldberg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm glad to see big Bill Clinton on television for 45 seconds every Sunday night. It's nice to see him do something for 45 seconds and not get his ass impeached.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi Goldberg:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this war talk has got me all upset. It's not a surprise though, because we are being led by a Bush, Dick and a Colin.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we're all about starting March Madness. That's the NCAA college basketball tournament. We start with 64 teams and then whittle them down to just one. You know, kind of like our allies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest in this war thing today, Mexico said they don't believe we have the right to go into Iraq. And believe me, there's one rule that Mexico is adamant about, it is respecting another country's borders.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Florida, the Air Force tested their largest bomb ever. They call it the 'Mother Of All Bombs.' You see this thing on the news? 21,000 pounds. They drop it out of the back of a cargo plane. They say it's intended to cause massive psychological damage. Yeah, because it blows your head off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon still has not given a name to the Iraqi war. Somehow 'Operation Reelect Bush' doesn't seem to be popular. Want to go with something a little more subtle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they keep telling us we're getting closer and closer to finding Osama bin Laden. Bin laden? I'd be happy if they could find Dick Cheney. Anybody seen him? Where is he? I haven't seen him in like a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But God bless them -- Hollywood -- Hollywood insists that the Oscars will go on, even if we are at war. Pardon me, but I just get emotional when I hear that kind of bravery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how many watched Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on their big debate on '60 Minutes?' You watch that thing? So strange. I'm so used to hearing Hollywood actors debating the issues. It was weird to listen to two guys who actually know what the hell they were talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was interesting how they rated it. Experts gave Dole the edge on the topic of foreign affairs, while Clinton holds the big edge in the extramarital affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabian officials announced today they are sending a flood of oil to the US. One million barrels a day in an effort to stabilize the gas prices. They said this will help because of the law of supply and demand. We have a lot of students here. You know how that works? See, they have the supply and then you demand all the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this past weekend, as part of International Woman's Day, hundreds of Iranian women held a rally in downtown Tehran, demanding equal rights. See, by law, the women in Iran, they have to wear the long coats and the head scarves. But a lot of the women took the head scarves off to protest. Or as the Iranians are calling it, 'Girls Gone Wild,' yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, they announced there's a new Website designed to help people cope with a national disaster. Oh, that will work good, yeah. I'm sure there won't be trouble logging on the Internet after a nuclear attack. I can't get AOL on a sunny day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new report by the Justice Department, over half, over half of all violent crimes are not reported. Well, duh. I mean, it's pretty hard to report a crime when you're dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, think about it, if you kill someone, well, you're not going to report it. The dead guy's not talking. When was the last time a murderer called the police? All right, besides Robert Blake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In California, a speech teacher is in a lot of trouble for encouraging her students to oppose the war with Iraq. Got in trouble, yeah. Yeah, the principal was furious and said, 'Telling kids to oppose the war is the French teacher's job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intelligence reports from Pakistan say that Osama bin Laden is constantly on the move and is always surrounded by an entourage of ten people. That's what they're saying. Yeah, as a result, bin Laden keeps getting mistaken for Jennifer Lopez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Motion Picture Academy said they would not cancel the Oscars even if war breaks out with Iraq. That's what they said, yeah. Not gonna cancel it no matter what. Yeah. Yeah, when asked why, producers said, 'There's a good chance the war will end before our show does.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you might know, President Bush spent today calling world leaders whose names he can't pronounce in countries he didn't know existed. 'Hello? Hookistan? Yeah, who am I talking to?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see this new bomb the government came out with the other day? The superbomb. Weighs 21,000 pounds. It's guided by a GPS system. Isn't that an SUV?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Air Force tested this thing yesterday in Florida. And the bomb's blast was so strong, at Disney world, 25 French tourists surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know why they tested this bomb in Florida? It's fascinating, because conditions in Florida are almost identical to Iraq. Florida, full of people who still don't speak English. Lots of sand. Warm climate. And of course, in Florida, they don't believe in fair elections, either. So that was the perfect place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm getting annoyed with these allies of ours. Like, in Europe, they're calling the US the bully of the world. You think so? When you were a kid, do you remember the bully taking a vote before he kicked your ass? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, here's my question. If we're the bully, how come everyone else gets to tease us, call us names, threaten to kill us and then we have to give them our lunch money? Why is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in Iraq right now, we're dropping millions and millions of leaflets out of small planes to the people there. I hope this doesn't give the Jehovah Witnesses in this country any ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon is sending dozens and dozens of lawyers to the Persian Gulf to act as legal advisers. They're sending lawyers over there. See, sometimes you have to fight evil with evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sending lawyers to the war zone. That should get Bush's popularity back up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they said today, God bless them, in the event of war, the Oscars will go on. There's a good chance the Oscars will last longer than the war, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more Hollywood celebrities protesting. The Beastie Boys have come out with a song protesting President Bush and the war in Iraq. The band acknowledges there are some things worth fighting for, like your right to party!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saddam Hussein continues his propaganda campaign. He claims 50,000 visitors come to Iraq every month for vacation. Oh, shut up. Where do they go? Club Ahmed? Is that where they go?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA says we are this close -- this close -- to capturing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. You know, why is it so hard to find this guy? What is he, he's 6'6&quot;, he's got a limp, he's got four wives and he travels with 50 kids. How hard is he to spot? Look for a minivan with a dozen people in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what else? Oh, the movie, 'Inspector Gadget 2' is coming out, starring French Stewart -- oh, I mean 'Freedom' Stewart, excuse me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, folks, as you know, the Homeland Security Department has announced their new slogan - 'Don't Be Afraid, Be Ready.' Catchy, isn't it? Well, apparently, they rejected lots of slogans before they settled on that one. So let's look at some of the ones, these are the homeland security slogans they've turned down: 'Patting Down Swarthy Foreigners One At A Time.&quot;Body Cavity Searches - In About An Hour.&quot;Our Terror Alert Colors Are: Raspberry Red, Lemon Yellow, and Orange Orange. Oh, Wait, That's Trix.&quot;Homeland Security - Do Not Confuse It With Home Pride Butter Top Bread.&quot;Boo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people angry at the French right now over this whole Iraqi situation. And in Washington, true story, the cafeteria where the members of Congress eat announced that it changed the name of their French Fries to 'Freedom Fries.' That's a true story. That'll show 'em, yeah. They really did that. Yeah, and folks, this is -- this is big. Nothing like this has happened since the 1950s, when Russian Dressing was changed to 'Commie Sauce.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvis Costello:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trip over [from England] was great fun. It's surprising how easy it is for a foreigner to get into your country.&quot; [Late Night With David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvis Costello&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be nice to the British. I'm your last ally. I'm all alone, facing an unruly crowd. I feel like Tony Blair.&quot; [Late Night With David Letterman]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hit the phone banks again today, trying to win support for this UN resolution. He didn't get any countries to join us, but he did get four of the countries to switch their long distance carriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military announced this week they're planning to use trained sea lions and seals to guard our ships in the Persian Gulf. See, that's when you know you don't have any allies, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to use sea lions to guard the ships and they're going to use dolphins to locate the mines. In fact, you know the only animal that won't help us? The French poodle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The French-owned hotel in New York, the Sofitel, I think we stayed there one night. They've taken down the French flag that used to hang out in front. They're in fear of an anti-French backlash. They've taken down their flag and replaced it with the American flag. How embarrassing? The war hasn't even started yet, and the French are surrendering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you call a French soldier in Iraq? Lost!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico still can't decide if they're with us over this Iraqi war. They think we might be moving too fast. See, Mexico thinks we should invade Iraq gradually. A few dozen people each night. Until one day there's more of them&quot; than the Iraqis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest rumor is that Saddam Hussein has set up training camps for suicide bombers in Iraq. God, do you believe that? It's training camp season already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How lame are you when you need training on blowing yourself up? You know what I'm saying? 'Now, look, Ahmed, put the dynamite belt on and then -- oh, no!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's something. Listen to this. This is just amazing. This new report came out today, it said Al Qaeda had a plot to assassinate President Bill Clinton when he was in Malaysia in 1998. They were going use a suicide fat girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our great Governor, Gray Davis, the most popular man in California, Governor Davis said he's considering a temporary -- oh, a temporary tax increase. They always call it a temporary tax increase. By temporary, they mean it will only last through your lifetime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are so paranoid now, they're developing this new James Bond SUV. Have you heard about this thing? It's based on the Ford pickup truck chassis and it has all kinds of like spy gadgets on it. It will even squirt an oil slick on the ground if you're being chased. Don't SUVs waste enough oil already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of crude oil, it just keeps going up every month. It's gonna reach an all-time high, they said, in April. You have any idea what that's going to do to the cost of a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken? It's huge!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they issued another terror alert today. Yeah, Robert Blake is getting out on bail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Ferrell:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, in case you haven't seen the film, Old School is about a bunch of older guys who hate responsibility and decide to start a fraternity. President Bush thought it was documentary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Ferrell:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has a special message for Dave, Dave if you're watching, the evidence is clear: All of America misses you, Dave. I'm giving you days, not weeks to come forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, true story, British Prime Minister Tony Blair listed six conditions that he is demanding Saddam Hussein meet to avoid war. That's right. Yeah, one of the conditions is that Saddam has to admit his beret makes him look kind of gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, McDonald's tried to appeal to more Arab customers in the Middle East by introducing a new sandwich called the 'McArabia.' That's true. Yeah, not only that, earlier today, they cut off the Hamburglar's hands for stealing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has advisers who coach him on what to say to these foreign leaders on the phone. It's kind of like telemarketing, basically, 'Hi, how are you today? I wanted to let you know we're bringing the war to your continent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, I thought I was watching the war coverage, I see this convoy of 100 Humvees coming down the street, and I realized, oh, it was just celebrities going to the Oscars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very dramatic moment last night, when documentary producer Michael Moore stunned Hollywood and the world, when he wore a suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, did you notice, when you get an Oscar, I believe you have to give it back to them so they can inscribe your name on it. You get it, and then they take it back and then they return it to you. At least that's what they told Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In more serious news, the war continues in Iraq. They're calling it 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' They were going to call it 'Operation Iraqi Liberation,' then they realized, uh-oh, that spells 'OIL.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they should call this war? Son of Bush versus Son of a Bitch. That's what they should call it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think right about now, Saddam Hussein is suffering from Iraq-tile dysfunction?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With his army not performing. That's Iraq-tile dysfunction. Very serious problem in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Baghdad expelled three CNN journalists last week because they didn't like the way CNN was reporting the war. They kicked them out. They also expelled three ABC journalists because they don't like that stupid show, 'Are You Hot?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news, not only do we have the Iraqis on the run, but late today, two of the Dixie Chicks surrendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, that was a big story while we were off last week. Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, she apologized. She insulted President Bush, but she apologized for insulting him while she was performing in England. She said she had no idea that it would hurt so many record sales -- ah, people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush had lunch with the Joint Chiefs. The Joint Chiefs. Kev, wasn't that the name of your band in college?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government insists that we are doing our best at keeping civilian casualties to a minimum over there. You know, if President Bush really wants to ruin this country but leave the civilians alive, send in his economic team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Ridge, our Homeland Security Director, he has a new homeland security program called 'Liberty Shield.' That's the best name, really? 'Liberty Shield?' Doesn't that sound like some kind of feminine hygiene product?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberty Shield, now with wings, new Liberty Shield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom Ridge also told the media to rest assured, the US government is prepared in case of a terrorist attack. He said the White House Administration, in the event of an attack, will be shuttled to an undisclosed safe location. The rest of us, we're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In what has to be the highest price in the nation, gas in El Cajon -- am I saying that right, El Cajon? Selling for over $4 a gallon! I didn't know Starbucks was selling gasoline, did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is now considering increasing the Federal gas tax by as much as 20 cents a gallon. And of course, the oil companies are furious because screwing the consumer -- that's their job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God we have responsible politicians. LA Mayor James Hahn and the LA City Council -- listen to this -- have agreed to pay $1 million to rent three endangered golden monkeys from China. Well, thank God we're not wasting taxpayer money on foolish things like crime and security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Missouri Congresswoman Karen McCarthy announced she will enter rehab after she fell down drunk in Congress after a big vote. Just drunk. Fell down the escalator. Huh? Who says women can't hold the same jobs as men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fox Network has hired Monica Lewinsky -- you all remember Monica -- to be the host of the new reality show called 'Mr. Personality.' You know, in this time of crisis, wouldn't Monica be much more help overseas entertaining our troops?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi TV has managed to stay on the air despite having virtually no resources left and no programs to put on. You know, kind of like ABC.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest story is -- now, this is really interesting. It seems there may be Russians in Baghdad helping the Iraqis jam our US Army weapons system. Well, that's nice to see, isn't it? The old evil empire giving a helping hand to the youngest member of the axis of evil, kind of a big brother program for dictators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, they say these are not Russians from the government. These are Russians from the private sector. So sounds like they're finally embracing capitalism, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else happened today in Iraq? A big sandstorm. Visibility was reduced to less than 50 feet, or as we call that in LA, clear skies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more reporters in harm's way today, and that was just at the Vanity Fair Oscar party.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tim Robbins came up to this Washington Post reporter, furious, and told him if he ever wrote about his family again, he would hunt him down. He would hunt him down. In fact, he would have beat him up right there, but he had to leave early to go to a peace rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a new category introduced at the Oscars this year -- Best Non-supporting Director. That went to Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Michael won an Oscar for best documentary. And then he made some antiwar statements during his acceptance speech, got booed, and he was upset. I mean, he was really mad when he was giving that speech. I haven't seen him that angry since he was charged for two seats on a Southwest flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Clinton claims he was always the first black President. See, since Michael Jackson came over to our side, there's some kind of exchange program. They got Clinton, we got Michael.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is launching a music career? Osama bin Laden's niece. I guess the Dixie Chicks have an opening act now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the war coverage, this is interesting, ratings at the cable news networks have shot through the roof. Did you know that? They're getting their highest ratings ever from cable news. That's right. Yeah, executives at MSNBC are thrilled and said, 'It's been years since both of our viewers have tuned in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now asking Congress for $75 billion to fight the war. And that's just for gas money, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are now reports that Saddam Hussein was injured in an initial US bombing, and he's receiving medical care in an underground bunker. In fact, he asked his doctors if he was gonna live and they said, 'Absolutely, yeah, you'll live, until the Americans get here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man who built Saddam Hussein's bunker said today on the news it is impossible to destroy. You cannot destroy this bunker. Of course the builder's going to say that. All contractors say that, don't they? 'Oh, this bunker, you could hit it with a nuclear -- and once we get the aluminum siding on, oh, it will be impenetrable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, in Baghdad they don't even need TV. They just look out the window, it's like CNN 3D at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk that the US wants to spray the poppy fields of Afghanistan in an effort to destroy the drug crop before it can be harvested. They want to destroy the drug crop. You thought Bush was unpopular in Hollywood before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is launching her music career in London? The 26-year- old niece of Osama bin Laden. This is true. Her name is Lafa bin Laden, and she said today in the paper she is worried her name may put some people off. You think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this is not the first bin Laden to have a music career. Osama bin Laden's nephew had a music career. Kenny Jihad? You know, Kenny Jihad?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Michael Moore, he's now known as the fourth Dixie Chick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today Oscar winner Michael Moore made another impassioned antiwar speech. He went on and on, then finally the woman at McDonald's drive-thru took the microphone back and said, 'Look, do you want the Big Mac combo or not?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another odd story. A company in Peru is developing a candy made out of cocaine and caramel. It's supposed to help people relax and relieve stress. When's the last time you saw anybody on coke that looked relaxed? Is that a good idea, cocaine with caramel? Don't you wind up with a lot of caramel stuck in your nose?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;LA Mayor Jim Hahn and the LA City Council have agreed to pay $1 million to rent three golden monkeys from China. I'm beginning to understand why this state is $34 billion in debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some happy news. Arkansas now has its very first Starbucks, or as the people in Arkansas call it, 'shock and awe.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To protest the war in Iraq, some restaurants in Germany have pulled American products like Coca-Cola and Budweiser off their menu. That will show us, yeah. Taking it off the menu, yeah. Yeah, which begs the question, who goes to Germany and orders Budweiser?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luke Wilson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hello, I'm documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, and I'm here to talk to you about the miracle of Weight Watchers.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, really I'm Luke Wilson, and you'll be happy to hear I'm a Hollywood actor who doesn't have an opinion about anything that doesn't affect me personally.&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luke Wilson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US bombers knocked Iraqi TV off the air. So, they won't be able to watch the big hit show over there, 'Eight Simple Rules for Dating My Goat.'&quot; [Late Show with David Letterman]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the IRS issued some guidelines on how to avoid getting audited. These are pretty good. They say, number one, don't list deductions that would raise a red flag. Don't do that. Number two, make sure you file on time. And number three, most importantly, don't make any stupid antiwar speeches at the Academy Awards!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today President Bush said we would stay in Iraq for as long as it takes. That's the same policy he had in high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush has promised to rebuild Iraq after he's done destroying the country. Now if we could just get Governor Gray Davis to promise to rebuild California after he's done destroying it, that would be terrific!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today it'll cost $30 billion to rebuild Iraq, which is not that bad. You know. Hey, that's still less than it cost to rebuild Cher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that picture the White House released today of Tony Blair? The Prime Minister of England and President Bush at their meeting last night. Look at this. Is that the best chair we can get for the President of the US? Doesn't anybody at the White House watch 'Trading spaces?' Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest reports are that Saddam Hussein is now receiving medical attention in his underground bunker. In fact, his biggest problem right now? Trying to find a good Jewish doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was reading about these new weapons we have now. It's just unbelievable. Like these smart bombs. These things are incredible. They not only find the target they're supposed to hit, they can actually knock on the front door, pretend to be the pizza delivery guy before they blow up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mayor of LA, Jim Hahn, backtracking after signing an antiwar petition circulated by a sixth grade class. He visited the school, and the kids came up to him with this petition, he signed it, and now he says he didn't know what he was signing. Isn't that embarrassing? Our Mayor can't read at a sixth grade level. No wonder we're in trouble, these stupid cities!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On President Bush's flight to Florida yesterday, Air Force One changed the breakfast menu from 'French toast' to 'Freedom toast.' That's true. They did that. They changed that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and in a further display of patriotism, President Bush then promoted Cap'n Crunch to Colonel Crunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, American and British troops handed out food to hundreds of hungry Iraqis. Isn't that great? Yeah. True story. They handed out food, yeah. Yeah, not surprisingly, the Iraqis handed the British food back. They were like, 'We are not that hungry. It's okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the U.S. military's been bombing Iraqi positions in south central Baghdad. Boy, you thought things were rough in south central L.A. What the hell's south central Baghdad like?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, stealth bombers dropped two of those huge satellite guided -- what do they call them? Bunker buster bombs. 4,700 pounds each. They were called Anna and Nicole.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were just watching the news. They had this US general on MSNBC, he was talking about our night vision capabilities. And he said, 'We own the night.' Aren't they going to get sued? Isn't that Michelob's slogan? ... Isn't that Lou Rawls?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today the war is not about timetables, it's about winning. Hey, worked in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing, when you watch these people, people complaining, 'Hey, the war is taking too long. We should have won this already. It's taking too long.' It's a week. That's what I love about our country. It's okay for 'American Idol' to take ten weeks to pick a bad singer. But the war, 'Hey, come on, come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This 24-hour live coverage of the war, 24 hours a day. This is pretty much uncharted territory for the networks. They've never done this before. ... CNN said today they have no idea how Wolf Blitzer will react to a full moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not many people know this. Way back in 1980, Saddam Hussein was given the key to the city of Detroit. Did you know that? ... A dignitary from Detroit traveled to Iraq and as a goodwill gesture. Of course, Saddam Hussein never actually went to Detroit. Of course not, way too dangerous. He wouldn't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States says they want to spray the poppy fields in Afghanistan in an effort to destroy the drug crop. ... And today, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown volunteered to be human shields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The transportation security agency said today they want to lay off 3,000 baggage screeners. Lay off 3,000 airport baggage screeners. This is part of our new, 'let's tip off the terrorists to what we're doing program.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;90 degrees here in Los Angeles. Isn't that unbelievable? 90 degrees. I tell you, people were sweating like Donald Rumsfeld trying to explain his battle plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, our American troops say one of the biggest problems they have in Iraq, this is a huge problem they have now, was trying to tell which side some people were on. Like Peter Arnett and Geraldo Rivera.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, NBC fired pinhead Peter Arnett. He gave an interview on Iraqi television criticizing the US military and saying our battle plan was all wrong. But the good news is, after he said that, today he was given an honorary Oscar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he gave the interview on Iraq's top morning show, which is hosted by Saddam's son. It's called &quot;Good Day, Uday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, see, I don't think NBC should have fired Peter Arnett. To teach him a lesson, they should have made him cover arena football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know the US military kicked Geraldo -- you know, we like Geraldo, but he always gets -- I guess they kicked Geraldo Rivera out of Iraq for revealing crucial details of military operations during a broadcast. He was drawing in the sand. He was going, 'Well, our troops are here, you see, and we're going to attack here.' Shut up, shut up! Kick him out? Can't we legally shoot him for that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have smart bombs and dumb reporters. Isn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Donald Rumsfeld issued stern warnings to the Iranian and the Syrian people, telling them not to cross the border into Iraq. We'll be watching. Do not try to cross the border. Good luck. We can't keep them from crossing the border at Tijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, the US bombed Saddam Hussein's personal luxury yacht. They blew up his yacht. See, that's when Republicans are out to get you, when they blow up your yacht.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, we used bombs to try and knock out Iraq's electricity. You know, it's interesting. I was thinking about this. They keep saying Iraq is about the size of California. They want to knock out electricity in Iraq, they should bring in California Governor Gray Davis. He's an expert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He could have them broke and in darkness in a second!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this. Saddam Hussein is now offering promotions and bonuses for suicide bombers. How stupid do you have to be? 'Tell you what, Ahmed. You come back from this, and I'll make you a captain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon said today another 100,000 troops headed to the Gulf. We have 250,000 there, another 100,000 are going over. They are calling this stage of the mission 'Operation George Gone Wild.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard about this. The UN has decided to restart the oil-for-food program with Iraq. You know what you get when you combine heavy crude oil with food? Kentucky Fried Chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, in 1980, Saddam Hussein was given the key to the city of Detroit. Isn't that amazing? He was given the key to the city of Detroit. Here's the interesting part. The more we bomb Baghdad, the more it starts to look like Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to Al Gore. Al Gore, 55 years old today. Although Florida counted, they say no, they got 48. So I don't know what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I thought this was nice. Today, Al Gore got a birthday card from President Bush from the Oval Office that said, 'Wish you were here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else was going on? United Airlines pilots have reluctantly agreed to accept $1 billion in pay cuts. That's a big pay cut. That's a new trend in airlines. Just cutbacks everywhere you turn. Everywhere you turn, everywhere you turn. That's a great combination. You got drunk pilots with guns who feel they are way underpaid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Arkansas. They now have their first Starbucks. Their very first Starbucks in Arkansas, open today. Listen to this, the governor says as soon as they get electricity, hot coffee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody here ever had the shingles? And it's, boy, those things are painful. 30 days, it took me to get over the shingles, and according to Donald Rumsfeld, that's right on schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know how they cured the shingles? Have any idea? In my case, you're not going to believe this. You know how they get rid of the shingles? Duct tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Geraldo Rivera? Well, he's a TV reporter for Fox, did you hear about this? And he's been tossed out of Iraq, apparently he was in Iraq doing some TV reporting for Fox, and they tossed him out of Iraq because he was revealing American military installations, the location of the installations, so Iraq tossed him out. And I'm thinking to myself, I'll bet you this is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to the Fox Television Network in their history, and then I thought 'No, wait a minute. This is Fox TV. That wouldn't even make the top 50.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, April Fool's day -- which, of course, is the day we traditionally honor the French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anybody else saw this. I'm watching the news today. I see a uniform guy with a bayonet and a gun, and he's leading these prisoners. You probably saw this. Single file, they're all handcuffed. And I realized, oh, not captured Iraqis. They're 'American Idol' contestants.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, today Dick Cheney -- Vice President Dick Cheney walked into George Bush's office -- walked into the Oval Office and said, 'You want to run things for a while?' Bush said, 'Sure.' And then Cheney went, 'April Fool!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest reports from Baghdad say that Saddam Hussein has been taking a lot of vitamins. B-1s, B-17s, B-52s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Saddam Hussein was supposed to appear on television and rally the Iraqi people -- supposed to be on TV -- but he was replaced at the last minute by Peter Arnett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Peter Arnett -- I guess you all heard this by now. I guess he gave an interview to Iraqi state-run TV -- the Iraqi TV in which he criticized US war plans, complimented the Iraqi resistance, and he said the American battle plan was a complete failure. In fact, listen to this, they said today if he comes back to the US, he could be charged with impersonating a Hollywood celebrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Peter Arnett goes on the Today show yesterday and apologized. He said he clearly made a misjudgment. He was truly sorry for what he said. Then later in the day, the same day yesterday, he gets hired by the London Daily Mirror, and he says, 'Look, I report the truth, and I make no apologies.' So if this new job doesn't work out, he can always try politics. Sounds like a natural, this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard, the US military has kicked Geraldo Rivera out of Iraq. He got kicked out, yeah. Let me tell you -- they thought this was the best way to get the Iraqi people on our side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this happened because I guess Geraldo was accused of giving away our military positions during one of his broadcasts, and he drew a thing in the sand and said, 'Look, we're here, and the Army's over there, and the bad guys are here.' So they expelled him from Iraq. And of course, now the tough part for Geraldo, finding another country that will take him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, a missile struck the largest shopping mall in Kuwait City in Kuwait. Luckily, it was 2:00 in the morning, or the mall would have been filled with like 10,000 Middle Eastern people. Or as well call it in LA, the Glendale Galleria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, a cruise missile blew up another part of Saddam Hussein's presidential palace, one of his palaces. Think about it. This guy -- he's got yachts. He's got palaces. He has luxury guards. No wonder he's surrounded by elite Republican Guards. He's a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, a British ship arrived with food and medical supplies. Well, sure, any time you're eating British food, you're going to need medical supplies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today he has a new plan -- a new plan to provide everyone with health care, a decent education. That also includes the rebuilding of roads and fixing of bridges, and if it works in Iraq, we may try it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Filling in for his son, former President George Bush, George Bush I, threw out the first pitch at the Pittsburgh Pirates/Cincinnati Reds game. George W. could not be there because he was filling in for his dad finishing off the war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this, according to the Pentagon, we may be running out of things to bomb in Baghdad. Earlier today, a cruise missile destroyed the Museum of Rubble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now this Iraqi television has released new video tape. Video tape of Saddam Hussein and his three sons. Were aware of the fact he had three sons? He has three sons. Uday is one, Qusay is one, and Little Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some confusion now whether Saddam Hussein is alive or dead. At first they thought they got him and no, we don't think we got him. Now, maybe we did, maybe we didn't. The video tape on Iraqi television earlier today and it's so confusing. It's Saddam Hussein -- I don't even get this, and he's speaking at his own funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, true story, the Air Force dropped hundreds of thousands of leaflets over Baghdad telling Iraqi soldiers they have no hope of winning. That's what they said, yeah. And immediately afterwards, the Air Force dropped the same leaflets on the New York Mets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporters in Iraq say a lot of US soldiers are becoming irritable because they are running out of cigarettes. In fact, the troops in the desert are becoming so desperate they're considering smoking actual camels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, it was reported that Saddam Hussein's wife is trying to leave him. Yeah, and when asked why, she said, 'He's not the madman I married.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that the Pentagon is trying to kick Geraldo Rivera out of Iraq because he revealed sensitive military information. Yeah, if Geraldo is kicked out, Saddam Hussein will once again be the most hated man in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things seem to be going a little bit better on the war effort. It was reported today Americans now control 40% of Iraq, which is pretty amazing when you consider Americans don't even control 40% of LA. So that's pretty amazing. Pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Saddam Hussein told his troops that victory was at hand. Americans are on the run. And that Iraq will win the war. And then he said, 'April Fool! Gotcha!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Saddam Hussein issued a second statement to the Iraqi soldiers. He said, 'Run!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting, the Pentagon says that the Iraqi military is having a tough time trying to figure out where we're going to attack next. You know, since we pulled Geraldo off the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said one of the few places left with working telephones in Baghdad was the Palestine Hotel. If you've never been to Baghdad, the Palestine Hotel is about a stone's throw from the Israeli hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said that while President Bush is monitoring the situation in Iraq, he's leaving the day- to-day decision-making to the military experts. Well, first they kick Geraldo out, then we rescued that female soldier, that's a wonderful story. Now we find out Bush isn't making the decisions. No wonder the stock market went up today, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, former President George Bush threw out the first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds game. Did you hear about this? Now, Al Jazeera network is reporting that the ball missed the catcher, killed five Iraqi civilians, and destroyed a baby milk factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC correspondent Peter Arnett, or former NBC correspondent Peter Arnett with the bad comb-over, fired by NBC after giving an interview to the state-controlled Iraqi TV network. Why would he do that? Why would he go on Iraqi TV? Even Tom Arnold turned down a pilot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In North Dakota, lawmakers in North Dakota have finally passed a law making bikini waxing illegal. Well, thank God we still have brave politicians willing to tackle the tough issues. That is another profile in courage, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number one movie in the country right now, 'Head of State,' our good friend Chris Rock. Chris plays the President. Oh, he runs for President and then he wins, even though he's clearly not qualified. A guy who's not qualified gets to be President. Like that could ever happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor was VH1 was going to premiere Madonna's new video this Friday but she decided to pull it. It's supposed to be very controversial. You heard about this? Madonna has this antiwar video. Well, in it they say Madonna throws a hand grenade at President Bush. But they say not to worry, it's clear, she's just acting. See, that's horrible. That is unbelievable. Not the grenade -- Madonna acting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charlie and Martin Sheen's Visa commercial, you know that one where they're in the video store? It's been pulled. It's been pulled, they say, because of Martin Sheen's antiwar views. Now if we could just get Carrot Top to come out against the war we won't have to see those stupid AT&amp;T commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq's elite Republican Guard, their elite Republican guard is doing so bad now they have changed the name to the Democratic Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think is interesting, we're hearing a lot now about Saddam Hussein's sons, you know, his sons, here's the names of the sons, Uday and Qusay. By the way, that's Pig Latin for Marty and Steve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Saddam Hussein has three sons, he has the Uday, the Qusay, and the hot tempered Sonny. That's right. It's the hot tempered Sonny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi TV has released old footage of Saddam Hussein because people say, well, he's dead and other people say no, no he's not dead, he's hiding. So Iraqi TV is releasing a lot of old footage of Saddam Hussein to try to prove that he's still alive. You know, it's the same thing we do with Dick Cheney. It's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday of course, you all know this probably by now, Saddam Hussein was scheduled to appear on Iraqi television, but once again, Saddam did not show up. Blew it off, yeah. Yeah, didn't show up. Yeah, apparently Saddam has the same agent as James Gandolfini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources at the White House -- this is the latest -- say that President Bush thinks he was called by God to lead the country through this difficult time. That's what he said. Yeah, unfortunately, nobody has the courage to tell the President he wasn't called by God. It was a Morning Zoo deejay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a hijacked plane was flown from Cuba to Florida. That's right, yeah. Unfortunately, the plane had to be sent back to Cuba because there were no major league pitchers on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced this week that the Starbucks chain is closing six stores in Israel. That's right. They're closing six stores in Israel, yeah. When asked why, a spokesman said, 'They're jittery enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Geraldo Rivera was again asked to leave Iraq for giving away sensitive information. Yeah, they want him out. Yeah, yeah. Afterwards, Geraldo said, 'I've never been so ashamed, and I'm Geraldo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces attacked Saddam and his international airport in Baghdad today. Did a good job. Yeah. See, here's my question, when you're fighting at the airport, do you still have to show up two hours early?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the toughest part for our US forces there, getting their weapons through the metal detectors.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I love, even though our forces are what, like this far from Baghdad. We're like eight feet away. That idiot, the Iraqi minister of information, they keep reporting 'Oh, coalition forces, they are not close at all. They're nowhere near Baghdad.' Show the press conference today. Watch this idiot, take a look. ... These people keep harping, they're like Cubs fans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was another war-related casualty today. The French were injured when they tried to jump on our bandwagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this? Yesterday, France came out in support of a US victory over Iraq. Oh, thanks for the help, guys. You don't know how much that means to us. For a minute there we though we might have to do it alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in his latest public statement, Saddam Hussein said he has no fear of the American army. Of course he doesn't, he's dead!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know how this is going to end. You know, inevitably Saddam will be in a tank, in will be one of those low-speed chases through the city, you know. 'He's on the Saddam 101 freeway. We're following him now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something very sad. I'm coming to work this morning, I go by Circuit City. I see Geraldo standing by an Iraqi TV set, pretending to be reporting on the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody notice we've really started winning this war once Geraldo was gone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night on The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly defended his Fox colleague, Geraldo Rivera, by saying all the information Geraldo gave out was already reported elsewhere -- yeah, by Peter Arnett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, also, very serious note, the FBI told the law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for terrorists making the poison gas ricin. They think terrorists may try to conceal ricin in harmless looking packages. Well, like this, if you see this in the market, don't buy this. Ricin Roni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is obviously not good. This is Ricin Roni, the Al-Jazeera treat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Tuesday, Iraq switched to daylight saving time. Don't they have bigger things to worry about over there? 'Ahmed, don't forget, turn the clock, we lose an hour of bombing! Turn the clock forward!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On MSNBC today they had this nutritionist and he said the average American is eating more and putting on weight because of anxiety over the war. We're eating more and putting on weight because of the war. Oh, shut up! What was it last year, the Olympics? Oh, the anxiety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're the only country when we're at war, we don't tighten our belts, oh, we loosen our belt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I did this morning, I got out of bed, and I do my Iraqi elite Republican Guard exercises. You know how that is, you put your hand above your head and you keep them there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday they busted into one of Saddam Hussein's palaces over there in Baghdad, he's got like 80 palaces and the US troops busted into one of them. And they did not find any chemical weapons, but in the refrigerator he had a can of expired yogurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't get about that Saddam Hussein guy: Nobody has ever seen the guy. Right, this is what I don't get, nobody has ever seen him, and now he's missing. What?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has three sons, were you aware of the fact that he had three sons? Yeah everybody knows that. They're named Uday, Uday is one. Qusay is another one, and from a first marriage, Gary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Geraldo Rivera, you know what I'm saying? Apparently he's goofing around and he pulls some boneheaded stunt and the Pentagon tosses him out of Iraq, they say that's it, you're no good, you're going home. US troops actually performed it, I think the name of the operation was 'Enduring Pain in the Ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics of the media are saying that cable news anchors are hyping the war too much and they're behaving like game show hosts. That's what they're saying, yeah. In fact, today, Wolf Blitzer asked Donald Rumsfeld to give his war update in the form of a question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Producers on Broadway say that because of the war, Broadway shows are suffering from weak ticket sales. That's right, yeah. Yeah, not only that, over at Les Miserables, the French are refusing to take part in the revolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those close to him say that President Bush has not altered his personal schedule very much since the start of the war. Hasn't changed much of anything. In fact, staffers say the only difference is that now he watches the news and tapes 'Sponge Bob.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to 'The Tonight Show' I'm Jay Leno's double. Jay is in his bunker 60 feet below the earth, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I had something strange happen to me yesterday. I'm coming to work, I turn on the radio in the morning. It seems the war is going badly. We weren't in control. The enemy was escaping, the people of Iraq hated us. Then I'm driving home, we're winning every battle, we're racing towards Baghdad, we're being cheered on by the Iraqi people. And then I realized what happened. On the way in I was listening to National Public Radio. On the way home, I was listening to Fox!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the bad news is it looks like Saddam Hussein is still alive. The good news -- we still get to kill him!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess he was on TV today, and people think, 'Oh, that wasn't him. One of his doubles.' And, you know, he does have a lot of doubles -- hand me that, would you? We got this. This is the Baghdad yellow pages. I just want to show you something. This is the most common ad in the Baghdad yellow pages. Can you get a shot of that? You see that? 'Saddam look-alike.' See that? 'Parties, birthdays'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was nice, on the video today, Saddam Hussein thanked Peter Arnett for filling in for him. Yeah, I thought that was very nice of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, US forces are now in control of Saddam Hussein International Airport. Here's how you can tell. They already added ten new flights a day from Baghdad to Vegas, nonstop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess our forces seized the airport in less than three hours. That's better than L.A.X.! You can't get through L.A.X.! If you left now, you couldn't get through L.A.X. in three hours!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess by the weekend, it looks like Baghdad should fall and we'll control the entire city. You know what that means? Sell the electric car, get an SUV! Lincoln navigators for everybody! Yeah! Free gas! Gas, a penny a gallon, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the electricity's out in Baghdad. Did you know that? So apparently they must have Pacific Gas &amp; Electric over there, too. Same thing as we have here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday special forces raided one of Saddam Hussein's palaces. I understand Saddam was furious, he was really upset. Apparently, after special forces broke in, it took ADT home security more than 45 minutes to respond. Yeah. I guess the alarm -- he's switching over. 45 minutes is -- yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. You know what Saddam Hussein's palace is? It's located on Saddam Hussein Boulevard next to the Saddam Hussein soccer field which is next to the Saddam Hussein Airport. This guy names everything after himself. He's like Donald Trump with better hair, basically, is what it is. That's all he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh -- and Donald Rumsfeld now admits, that yes, the war has taken a little longer than expected. He said, for one thing, they wanted to throw Geraldo out the first week. But they had to postpone it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Martin Sheen's Visa commercials have been pulled off the air. Reportedly because of his political views. So apparently Visa is everywhere you want to be, unless you're in an anti-war march, then you're screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile over at Fox, Geraldo Rivera -- he was named news man most likely to reveal military secrets. So it's a different kind of an honor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news from Iraq. The US forces have penetrated the red zone. They have penetrated the red zone yes, yeah. Do you know what that means? No parking. That's what it means.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we lost, we all lost an hour over the weekend, which is nothing compared to Saddam Hussein. He lost, what, an airport, a couple of cities, a few tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that footage on the news of the guy zooming, our guys zooming down the highway in Baghdad, shooting and driving at the same time. No, that was this morning on the 101. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, our forces have taken over Saddam Hussein's International Airport and renamed it Baghdad International Airport, which, you know -- is that the right name? Shouldn't we have called it something more appropriate, like the 'No Thanks to France or Germany International Airport?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you something, even though we've only controlled the airport now for a couple of days you can already see the American influence. I mean, since we took over, three of the airlines have already gone broke, the luggage has all been lost and the pilots are all drunk already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news is, since we now control it, it's the only airport in the world where all the cab drivers actually speak English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you ever notice when they show these live pictures from Baghdad, you see the bombs going off and the smoke and the fire. And there's always a few cars cruising down the freeway. Where the hell are those people going? 'Let's go to the movies. Let's go see 'Apocalypse Now' and get away from this nonsense.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not going too good for Saddam Hussein. He was on TV again yesterday and tomorrow, I understand, he's going to be on an episode of 'Crossing Over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, US forces bombed the house of a notorious Iraqi general known as Chemical Ali. Chemical Ali. Show his picture. There he is, Chemical Ali. Now, don't confuse him with this man, 'Chemical Nolte.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, US troops found a huge cache of weapons at a high school in Baghdad. Weapons at a high school. So apparently, their kids are just like our kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do the Iraqi Republican Guard and the Los Angeles Clippers have in common? Neither one's going to be around for the playoffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, are you like me? Been driving around with your gas tank near empty waiting for the war to end 'cause you think you're gonna get, like, free gas now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush flew to Northern Ireland for peace talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair. When you want to talk peace, what better place to go than Northern Ireland? I guess South Central's booked up, so they went there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony Blair said today the US has no plans to attack Syria or Iran. Bush said, 'We don't?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The publishers of Hillary Clinton's memoirs, for which she received the largest book advance in history, the publishers are worried she's way behind. It's supposed to go to the printer's next month -- she hasn't turned in a manuscript, even come up with a title yet. But in her defense, fiction is a lot harder to write.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how far behind she is, she's only up to Clinton's 25th affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very energetic crowd for a hot day. What was it, 85? 85 in Los Angeles today. I was sweating like Peter Arnett at a VFW convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, I'm watching some war footage, you know? I see a bunch of men in uniform waving white flags and surrendering. And then I realized -- Detroit Tigers. Detroit Tigers, that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does not look good for Saddam Hussein and his sons. Yesterday, we bombed the Baghdad restaurant where they were eating. In fact, today I went on the Internet and they were selling pieces of Uday and Qusay on Ebay. That's not good. A bad sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea of how bad the bombing was, the name of the restaurant is now 'Crater Vick's.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I feel sorry for? The restaurant owner. I mean, it's bad enough if you see Hussein and all his people walk in the restaurant, 'cause right there you know you got to pick up the check. Right? 'Cause, you know, it's Hussein. You gotta pick up the check. You're paying. You put the salad down and hear that bomber going over. Uh-oh, that can't be a good feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the military said we'll be able to confirm Saddam is dead through DNA testing. We actually have a sample of his DNA. Isn't it amazing? So, apparently, Monica Lewinsky's working for the CIA now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also been confirmed that the man known as Chemical Ali has also been killed. ... I guess they blew up his house earlier in the week. So, Chemical Ali, they think is Formaldehyde Ali.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And coalition forces say they've discovered a dozen 55-gallon drums containing chemical weapons. But today, the Iraqi information minister -- I love this guy. You see this guy? 'Those are not chemical weapons! Those were peaches in light syrup.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, US troops blew up a 40-foot statue of Saddam Hussein. You see this thing? Hussein built a 40-foot statue of himself. And today, Donald Trump goes - 'I wonder how much that cost?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the LA Times, the US Post Office has chartered two cargo jets to deliver mail to our troops in the war zone. Boy, if the Iraqis think our military's heavily armed, wait until they see our postal workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I've been watching our friend, that Ted Koppel over there. You know, he's covering the war in Iraq. He does a great job. A terrific reporter, Ted Koppel. But here's my question -- with that hair, does he really need a helmet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little closer to home, both Ford and General Motors announced another round of cost cutting measures, yeah. The bad news -- this could mean hundreds of people losing their job. The good news -- they're all in Canada and Mexico. We lost those jobs ten years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They announced the Pulitzer Prize winners for journalism yesterday. Peter Arnett won for best Iraqi reporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Best fiction writing went to our own Governor, Gray Davis, for the California budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton, you know, she got -- what, a $2.8 million advance to write her book. She's been putting it off. This is the new book. This is the title they finally decided on. This is Hillary Clinton's new book. Can you get a shot at it? 'Once He Went Fat, He Never Went Back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Syracuse beat Kansas, 81-78. Yeah, yeah. Biggest disappointment for people in Kansas, oh, man. They were more upset -- they haven't been this upset since they found out Bob Dole is on Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Late Show, ladies and gentlemen. We have a pretty good group here tonight, except for some sporadic, light resistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just saw some interesting information from Iraq's Minister of Information. He's a lot of fun isn't he? He says Saddam Hussein is not dead, he's just out with the shingles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard about this. Last night, the US dropped four 2,000 pound bombs on Saddam Hussein. I mean, I don't know anything about explosives, but do those things even need to explode?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't seen bombs that big since the CBS' Saturday night lineup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And listen to this, they say Saddam Hussein's three ex-wives have already fled into Syria. Three ex-wives? I heard that, and I said, 'Well, geez, maybe he's faking his own death.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US military dropped four huge bombs on a restaurant where they thought Saddam Hussein was having lunch. It's true, they did. Yeah. Yeah, it was right after Saddam made the mistake of telling the waiter, 'Surprise me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, White House sources said that President Bush has a three-part rebuilding plan for Iraq. That's right. Yeah, not surprisingly, most of President Bush's rebuilding plan involves Legos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course you know the big story, our troops have taken over Baghdad. I guess you all know that. Being warmly greeted by the Iraqi people. Have you seen it on TV? I mean, these Iraqis are celebrating this victory. They're looting stores. They're running wild in the streets, or as we call it in LA, an NBA championship. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something -- they're learning what we mean by freedom. Free TVs. Free stereos. Free VCRs. Yeah, just take it. It's smash and grab. Didn't take them long to get the hang of the American way of life.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see them dancing in the streets? I watched that today. The people looting are dancing in the streets. And it made me realize, you know what these people need more than food and medicine? Dancing lessons. They don't know how to dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But tonight, President Bush warned, you know -- don't be too gleeful. He said there are still pockets of resistance. There are still people fighting. Barbra Streisand, the Dixie Chicks, Susan Sarandon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big news is, we don't know if Saddam Hussein is dead or just not dead yet, basically, is what it is. Reports came in today -- actually, they said Saddam Hussein has been spotted in central Baghdad. Parts of him also spotted in northern Baghdad and western Baghdad. And eastern Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the story by now. The US military bombed a restaurant where they thought Saddam Hussein was eating. Actually, the military heard it was either Saddam or Geraldo. They figure, either way...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They dropped four 2,000-pound bombs on the place. And actually, we may have killed two birds with one stone. Turns out, it was also karaoke night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess they are now sifting through the rubble to try and find the remains of Saddam Hussein, which is kind of fitting. I mean, we're looking for a dirt ball under a rock, basically, is what we're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the interesting thing -- even if Saddam Hussein is not dead, now that America controls Baghdad, that means he has less than a week to do taxes. So he's screwed either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And my favorite guy was on the news yesterday, denying that Saddam is dead. The Ministry of Information guy from Iraq, what's his name, Joe Isuzu?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we have now captured all of Saddam Hussein's palaces and residences. So, if he is alive, he has no place to live. He has no place to live now. And if he thinks Bush was hard on him before, wait until Saddam sees how the Republicans treat the homeless. Oh, my gosh -- he is screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess now a lot of Iraqis are looting the presidential palaces. They're taking everything. The stationery, the ashtrays. Even a grand piano. Guys were carrying out a grand piano. Reporters said they haven't seen looting like this at a presidential residence since Clinton's last day at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, you know, after the war, we have to make a critical decision. We have to decide who takes over the government of Iraq. 'Cause let's face it, this is important because that's who we're going to be fighting, you know, five or ten years from now. We got to be careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A dozen Al Qaeda members now hiding in Mexico, trying to figure out how to get across the US border to do us harm. Let me tell you something, if these people are not smart enough how to figure to get across the US-Mexican border, I don't think we have anything to worry about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here is the good news, we have defeated Saddam Hussein and Iraq. The good news is Iraq is ours, and the bad news Iraq is ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the really difficult part, we have to rebuild Iraq into a strong independent nation, that will one day hate the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this, Iraq's Minister of Information did not show up for his press conference today. Did not show up for his press conference. However, he claims he was there and he said it went very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been watching the Minister of Information, the Iraqi Minister of Information? The guy is very entertaining, isn't he? Yesterday he said that Saddam Hussein was not dead, he was just in rehab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq right now it's 100 degrees. And it's even hotter where Saddam is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was fascinating to watch. Yesterday the Iraqis and US troops pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein. How many of you got a chance to see that? It was the US troops and the Iraqi citizens, and it was a big, 25 foot statue. And they get a hold of it, and they rope it off, and they pull it down, and it lands right on top of Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Things Iraq's Information Minister Has To Say About The War: 10. We're pulling down statues of Saddam to have them cleaned. 9. Don't believe that stuff you see on CNN...or NBC or CBS , ABC, Fox, or MSNBC. 8. If you ask me who the winner is, it depends on what your definition of 'is' is. 7. Iraqi television is off the air because we didn't want you to have to watch 'Becker.' 6. Do you know of any job openings for a lying weasel? 5. Wolf Blitzer and I are engaged. 4. Iraqis are in the streets celebrating Cher's 40 fabulous years in show business. 3. Incoming! 2. Saddam's not dead, he's just out with a case of the shingles. 1. War? What war?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC reports that the Kurdish minority in Iraq are celebrating and dancing in the streets now that Saddam Hussein has been overthrown. Celebrating and dancing. That's right. Yeah. In fact -- in fact, they're so happy, they've released a video called 'Kurds Gone Wild.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coalition forces destroyed a restaurant where Saddam Hussein was reportedly having lunch. That's right, yeah, yeah. Blew it up. Blew it up, yeah. Sadly, it was the only Planet Hollywood making money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people have filed their taxes already? Have you done that? You know, President Bush still hasn't filed. No. Not because he's too busy. He's just waiting to see if he can write off Saddam Hussein as a total loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read in the paper today, there's going to be a big meeting this week to discuss postwar Iraq with the leaders of France, Germany and Russia, or as they're also known, the Axis of Envy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very exciting watching this footage from Baghdad. Isn't it? You know, to see Saddam Hussein kicked out of office, driven from office. It's the same feeling people had when Kathie Lee got knocked off Regis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, people still looking for clues if Saddam Hussein is alive or not. He hasn't appeared on TV now in a number of days. And of course, for celebrities, that's a fate worse than death, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Jesse Jackson said, 'Not on TV for three days. He must be dead!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see the Iraqi people tearing down that statue of Saddam? You know, I tell ya --it's hard to believe he won 100% of the vote in the last election!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the last thing Saddam said to his sons at that restaurant before they blew it up? 'I told you we should have used the drive through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Al Jazeera network now claiming that we shot two of their reporters on purpose. Two Al Jazeera reporters. They're saying we did it on purpose. You know, if we're shooting journalists on purpose, do you think Peter Arnett and Geraldo would still be around?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, I feel so bad. I had a great monologue all prepared for tonight, and then the Iraqis looted my jokes earlier today. I got hit in the face with a shoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see those looters on TV? It was unbelievable. Did you ever notice there's something universal about the looting impulse? No, because it's the same all over the world. People always go for the couches and the TV sets first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's the first step towards winning the hearts and minds of these people. You can give a man a couch and a TV to watch, he'll be indoctrinated to the American way of life like that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking at a memorial dinner the other night, former First Lady Barbara Bush, Barbara Bush said, and I quote, this is her quote, she said, 'I watch him guard our country through this difficult time, and I can't help but wonder, is this the same kid I used to spank?' Well, here's the weird part. She was talking about Donald Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, Hillary Clinton's writing a book, but it's not finished yet. In the meantime, she's put out a children's book that just came out today -- it's right here, it's by Hillary Clinton. It's called 'Clinton Hears A Ho.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke directly to the Iraqi people today, and he told them -- this is a quote - 'Your nation will soon be free.' That's nice. That's what he said. That was an exact quote, yeah. Actually, the entire quote, 'Your nation will be free, and our gas will soon be $1 a gallon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US soldiers in Iraq say that one of the things that's keeping them going and inspiring them is all the letters they're receiving from schoolchildren around the country. I thought that was really nice, yeah. Yeah, then someone explained that those letters are actually from President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many paid your taxes already? Done that? Here is a frightening tax statistic. It is now estimated that all of the money the average American makes at work from morning until lunch goes to the government. You know what I do? Go to lunch at 10:00.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you're worried about an audit you should avoid what's called a red flag. You know what that is? See, a red flag is something the IRS looks for, like, here is a good example of a red flag -- let's say after you've paid your taxes, if you still have some money in the bank, that's a red flag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before I continue, I would like to welcome all of the Iraqi people who are watching this show for the very first time on their brand new TV set they just stole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we have entered a new phase of the war -- we've gone from shock and awe to loot and scoot. Loot and scoot. As you know, tremendous amount of looting going on in Iraq right now. And believe me, that's nothing. Wait until the oil companies get there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see after they knocked down that statue of Saddam Hussein, they showed the one guy hauling away the giant broken head. What are you going to do with that? That's so typical guy. Guys will take anything that's free and think 'this will go great in the house.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush saw to it today that all the celebrating Iraqis were given absentee ballots for the next presidential election in Florida. How about that? Very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today that Al Gore wanted to go visit the troops in Baghdad but he canceled when he saw what they do to statues over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today he thinks the arms inspectors should resume looking for weapons in Iraq. Hey, forget looking for arms in Iraq, how about looking for some backbone in the UN?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government of Haiti has officially sanctioned voodoo as a religion. Voodoo is a religion now in Haiti. Well, here at home the Bush Administration has sanctioned voodoo as an economic plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
