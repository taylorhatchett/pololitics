<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy New Year, everybody. We are live tonight. Unfortunately, so is Bin Laden and Scott Peterson, but that's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In just 25 minutes, Secretary Colin Powell will push the button to drop the ball in Times Square. Powell said the hardest part, getting a cab to take him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;NBC gave me a Christmas gift that literally made my heart stop. It was a bottle of Aleve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Drug companies are now asking their employees to be on the lookout for Michael Moore, who's making a movie about the pharmaceutical industry. Like 9/11, he's doing a movie about the drug industry. Do you have to be on the lookout for Michael Moore? Isn't he kind of easy to spot?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Osama bin Laden has released yet another audiotape saying that any Iraqi voting in the January election will be considered an infidel and will be punished by God. And he also urged people not to waste their vote on Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Cuba, Fidel Castro says they have found a drilling site in Cuba with 100 million barrels of oil. How long before Bush says, 'People of Cuba, we are here to free you. You will no longer live under oppression and tyranny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Here in New York, thousands of people partied in funny hats and popped balloons in Times Square. Yeah. Those who were there said it was just like the Republican Convention, but with black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush said that he doesn't really celebrate New Year's Eve and plans on being in bed by 9:30. That's what he said. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton said she does celebrate New Year's Eve, and plans on being in bed by 9:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ukrainians had the runoff election. The winner was the opposition candidate, Yushchenko? That guy, he won. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Bush was shocked when he heard Yushchenko won. He said, 'I didn't know Weird Al was running.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Yushchenko now is tying to fill his cabinet. You know his toughest cabinet position over there? Food taster.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number one movie over the weekend, 'Meet the Fockers,' starring Barbra Streisand, Ben Stiller, Robert de Niro, Dustin Hoffman. The film set a record, it's the first win for the Democrats all year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, is the end of President George Bush's Christmas vacation, and tomorrow he begins his winter vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fidel Castro has announced that an oil site with up to 100 million barrels of oil in it has been found off the coast of Cuba. The only problem is you give the Cubans 100 million barrels, the entire population will float to Miami in them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news -- the FBI now says today, there's no terrorist link involving people shining laser beams into the eyes of airline pilots. Turns out it was just pranksters. Whew, that makes me feel better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're on a flight, and your pilot suddenly goes, 'My eyes, my eyes!' Oh, it's just kids. Wacky pranksters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past three years, only 34 people have died in aviation accidents, making it one of the safest periods in history for the airlines. Isn't that amazing? You know what that means? The pilots were actually flying better when they were drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Christine Todd Whitman's new book &quot;is called 'It's My Party, Too: The Battle for the Heart of the GOP.' See, that's the part I don't get. The battle for the heart of the Republican Party? Isn't that like fighting for the brain of the Democratic Party?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anybody got this week's Newsweek, there's an interview in there with John Kerry. And John Kerry -- this is his quote -- John Kerry said he didn't lose the election, he just didn't win it. See, that's the kind of clear, decisive thinking we all loved about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration's proposing a change to the Social Security system. They want to cut benefits by nearly a third in the next 20 years to 30 years. The new program is called 'Good luck, grandma. You're on your own. You've fallen and you can't get up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Violent crime, according to the year-end statistics, violent crime in New York City is way, way down. It's amazing, isn't it? And it just goes to show you, you get Martha Stewart off the street and look what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's rumors that Osama bin Laden has moved to a major city. Isn't that odd? Apparently he plans to keep his cave for the weekends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the third year in a row, Oprah Winfrey was voted America's favorite TV personality. I'm very proud. I also was on that list. I was a little farther down. I was right between Bernard Kerik and Scott Peterson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress returned to session yesterday after about a month off. Did you even notice that they were gone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's when you know you have a government job. Can you think of any other job where you leave for a month, and nobody even knows you weren't there?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress has reelected Dennis Hastert as Speaker of the House. He's right after the vice president in line to the president. Which means he's a heartbeat away from a guy who barely has a heartbeat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news, the government reports that there has been a big increase in factory orders. The bad news, most of the orders, to pack up the factory and move it to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so happy we have a good group in the audience tonight, because last night the audience, whoa, horrible! ... Here's how lousy they were. After the show, they went out and pointed a laser beam at a jet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turned out it's a guy in New Jersey. You hear about this? He was pointing a high powered laser beam at jetliners as they would fly other his house. And they grabbed the guy and arrested the guy and everybody is okay. One good thing did come of the episode, the in-flight meals were warmed up a little from the laser, but that's...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an animal rights group, I thought this was fascinating, they asked former President Carter to stop fishing. How about that? They told him to stop fishing, and I was thinking about this. This makes him the first president ever, I believe, told to put away his rod since since...well, Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Cabinet in Washington, new ideas are coming out of there. A new one to eliminate the Social Security crisis and help with the war in Iraq. Draft the elderly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, pilots are asking people to shine lasers at them just for the warmth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger gave his state of the state address last night. He talked about his solution to the high cost of prescription drugs. He said, 'Stop whining, and walk it off. There is nothing wrong with a tumor you can't walk off.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has begun working on his inauguration day speech. He says that when he is sworn in, he will swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the US and the treasure map that is drawn on the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, tourists can experience what it is like to take the oath of office as president at a virtual swearing-in station. Your image is up on a giant screen while an actor playing a Supreme Court justice swears you in. Kind of like a fantasy camp for Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent Lott, who is in charge of the inaugural ceremonies...he announced that one of the performers at the inaugural event this year is a former singer from the Lawrence Welk show who will sing a song by John Ashcroft. Who said the Republicans don't know how to party?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if they did that at Guantanamo Bay, the Red Cross would declare it cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alberto Gonzales, nominee for US attorney general, answered some tough questions from Congress today about his role in the Iraqi prison torture scandal. But afterward, he said that to make himself relax, he said he used that old trick of imaging the audience in their underwear...with hoods over their heads, being lead around on a dog leash by a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy in New Jersey was arrested because he was shooting laser beams at commercial jetliners. I'm telling you, it was so unnerving that the pilot poured himself another scotch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and his wife, they've got a new dog today. Isn't that cute? The little rascal has stained the rug in the Oval Office. So they had to name him Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why the President had to get a new dog -- because the old one resigned.&quot;</SPAN></P>

In fact, today Governor Schwarzenegger finally told the Indians, 'Okay, we'll give you more casinos, stop dancing, stop making it rain, stop the rain from coming down, you can have whatever you want.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;USA Today is pointing out,&quot; Amber Frey's &quot;book is aimed at women who have been lied to by seductive men. In fact, today Hillary Clinton bought 50 copies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post says that Monica Lewinski and Chelsea Clinton were recently at the same nightclub, but did not run into each other. See, actually, Chelsea walked by Monica's table. Luckily, you know, she was under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news -- San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has announced that he and his wife are getting a divorce. Well, you see, that town never should have allowed straights to get married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;January 2005, you know what that means, among other things, the election is supposed to be held in Iraq. ... They think it's going to be close. They think it's going to come down to the New York City cabdriver absentee ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that Donald Trump? This guy is introducing a line of hair care products. I mean, that's like George Bush publishing a dictionary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, preparations are in high gear for the for the Bush inauguration. It's really beginning to look bad now for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Everybody at the White House is very excited about the inauguration. Earlier today, the Bush twins picked a designated driver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an update on that Miss Beazley, the new puppy at the White House. Today there was a biting incident involving Dick Cheney. Don't worry. The dog's OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, scientists said today if&quot; the rain &quot;keeps up much longer, this could actually create a hole in our smog layer.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Palestinians went to the polls, and they elected a new president, Mahmoud Abbas, I believe his name is. And John Kerry was there. John Kerry was there as an observer. You know, same role he played in our last election. Keeping an eye out, checking things out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, President Bush kept the promise. Remember he said he would create jobs? Well, he's done just that. Over at CBS News, created four more jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four people have been fired from CBS over the Dan Rather report on President Bush's National Guard scandal.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government officials in Mexico are printing up a million copies of a book of tips on how to safely illegally immigrate to the United States. The government says it wants to make it easier for people to sneak in. Could it be any easier?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to film director Michael Moore. He won a People's Choice award for Fahrenheit 9/11. Actually, Michael Moore, he was very gracious last night. He thanked all the people who made him what he is today. Dave Thomas of Wendy's, Colonel Sanders, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember President Clinton, right? Bubba. He and George W. Bush are apparently buddies, they're pals, they're getting together, hanging around, becoming friends. A lot of people think it may just be Clinton's way of making a move on the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, what a storm we had last night -- almost as many trees have been knocked down by this storm as been knocked down by the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Michael Moore won a People's Choice award the other night. In fact, this may be the first time the Republicans asked for a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, President Bush admitted there are four areas of Iraq where it will be very difficult for people to vote. The east, the west, the north and the south.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what President Bush said. He said, 'The election will go ahead as scheduled because it doesn't matter if nobody votes. The important thing here is to say you held an election.' Worked in Florida.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush -- getting ready for his inauguration next week, working on the speech. It's a pretty good speech. So far, we've got -- it's, 'Ask not what your corporation can do for you, but what you can do for your corporation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A big shake-up at CBS News over the story about President Bush and the falsified National Guard records. CBS issued a report saying 60 Minutes was misled by an unreliable source. Yeah, I think his name was Dan Rather, wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, when the report came out, Dan was not at his anchor spot at CBS. He didn't do it last night. They said he was on assignment. Oh, shut up. He was hiding in the basement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The independent counsel also&quot; concluded &quot;that CBS failed to follow basic journalistic principles in reporting. And then today, Fox said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. I appreciate that, but honestly, how many of you folks are just here for the openings at CBS News?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like a bloodbath over at CBS News. Have you heard about all of the firings? It's crazy. I believe the last time this many CBS executives got fired was, well, shortly after I was hired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people fired by CBS, you know, I heard about this. They were treated badly. The people who got fired by CBS News, and I'll got right on record and say it. They were treated shabbily. They were called together and forced to form a naked pyramid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about Mahmoud Abbas was elected president in Palestine? Did you hear about that? I understand the votes were counted by Mahmoud Abbas's brother, Jeb Abbas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess who was at the Detroit auto show opening night? Bill Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, that's right, doing his part. And they have the beautiful auto show models, you know, demonstrating the cars like that, and he was seen talking to one of the auto show models, apparently about the price for a Hummer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that the security arrangements for the upcoming presidential inauguration will be the most extensive in history, and that's just to keep the Bush twins away from the champagne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS News today has fired four employees for wildly fabricating a news story. The good news, they all got jobs over at Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that the First Lady's -- Laura Bush's -- dress for the inaugural ball will be designed by Oscar de la Renta. And today, President Bush said he was surprised. He said, 'Look I love the kid as a boxer. I had no idea.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the Bush twins will wear dresses by Bagley Mishka. Do you know that name? And Dick Cheney's daughter will wear LL Bean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United states has stopped searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. ... So two years of looking, one war, and the closest we came to was a pound and a half of rancid Mutton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You like those celebrity biography things? ... PBS had one on tonight, biography of Osama bin Laden. Many interesting stories about Osama bin Laden. Apparently he was compulsive about washing his hands and he dated Ava Gardner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced today that he wanted to institute a test to ensure that high school students are reading at their grade level. ... Yeah, Bush said the program is necessary 'cause many students aren't reading at their grade level -- they're reading at a presidential level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahmoud Abbas &quot;is the new President of the PLO. Asked about Abbas, President Bush said 'Hey, I love that song Dancing Queen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, US authorities refused to allow a British Airways flight bound for New York to land on American soil, because a suspicious passenger was on board. They requested the flight be diverted to Bangor, Maine. Now, I'm no geography expert. How does that make the people of Bangor feel?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, did we lose Maine in a poker game? What happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commerce Department reported that the American trade deficit soared to an all-time high of $60 billion in November. That is unbelievable. It's so bad now, Mexicans are going to India to try and find good American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Virginia, President Bush announced tough new reading standards for high school students. He wants ninth graders to read at an eighth grade level by the time they're in the 12th grade.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball announced their tougher steroid testing policies. The new steroid rules will impose a $100,000 fine for a five-time steroid offender. You know what the old penalty was for a five-time offender? Most valuable player trophy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what bothers me is the timing of all this steroid stuff. Maybe I'm paranoid because I'm from Boston, okay? After 86 years, the Boston Red Sox finally win the World Series. People are going, 'No, they got to be on something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government issued new dietary guidelines today. ... You know, they come out with this food pyramid, what, every five years? You think that helps? Have you seen most Americans? We are food pyramids, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched the NBC show 'The Biggest Loser' the other night? One of the female finalists, Kelly Minor, she didn't win, but she lost 79 pounds. ... She looks great. She said she feels great. And finally, she stopped getting all those annoying calls from Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush now says that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Oh. I'll be darned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, but Bush says there is strong evidence that Saddam Hussein had an illegal nanny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House announced that Ruben Studdard will be performing at one of President Bush's inaugural celebrations. Republicans say they chose Studdard 'cause he's one of the red states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball announced today it's going to institute tougher steroid testing. For the first offense, players will receive a ten-game suspension, for the second offense, players will receive a batting championship.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House officially concluded today that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Boy, what a tough couple of months it's been for George Bush. This month, no weapons. Last month -- last month, no Santa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball has announced a tough new drug testing policy. Jason Giambi got confused by the new testing. He thought you were supposed to test every drug, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, under the new agreement, players who test positive will now be slapped on both wrists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new rules are a little bit tougher. They include random drug testing, suspension for a maximum of ten days for first-time offenders, and every time a player hits a home run, while rounding third base, they have to stop and pee in a little cup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And every single team in the league is subject to these testing guidelines. Well, except the Chicago Cubs -- they need all the help they can get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials in the State Department now say that in the Iraqi presidential elections, the Sunnis are refusing to vote. So you know what that means -- this whole thing is turning to Shiite now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two companies are now making RV's that they say can withstand radiation from a nuclear attack. Of course the bad news, you have to spend the next 10,000 years in your RV.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A celebrity birthday right here at CBS, Andy Rooney, ladies and gentlemen, 86 years. ... The gang there at 60 Minutes got together and gave him a lovely forged birthday memo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders claim&quot; George W. Bush and Bill Clinton &quot;are actually friends. Listen to this, in fact after Clinton's recent heart surgery, President Bush was nice enough to send him a get-well intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that both John Kerry and Al Gore want to run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Yeah, Senator Hillary Clinton is furious, saying, 'Hey, it's my turn to lose.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's inauguration is going to cost $40 million, due in part to the huge security force. ... Security personnel will be on hand to keep people away from President Bush and to keep Dick Cheney away from the scallops wrapped in bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in USA Today, President Bush said he is not going to spend any more money on programs that aren't working. You know what that means? Hey, I guess the war in Iraq is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush told the reporter that he thought of his reelection by the American people as their approval to continue the war in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of con artists out there, selling phony inaugural party tickets. Like, I got an invitation in the mail to a performance for something called, 'George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some groups are now calling on people to fast and pray on the day of Bush's inauguration to protest the election. Well, that's not going to work. The people who fast and pray, they're the ones who voted Bush in!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at her confirmation hearing for Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice said it is time for the US to start using more diplomacy. You know what that means ? I guess we're running low on ammunition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor that Al Qaeda is going bankrupt. Al Qaeda may be going bankrupt. And I think perhaps this is true. Here's why. Last week, Martha Stewart dumped her Al Qaeda stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential inauguration is &quot;an enormous celebration, a huge ritual, very, very expensive, very, very lavish, repeated once every four years. No, I'm sorry, that's the Trump wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historians say the most commonly used phrase during inaugural addresses is, 'My fellow citizens.' That is the most common phrase. However, the most common phrase during President Bush's speech is expected to be, 'My fellow United Statesers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, talk show host Jerry Springer called the war in Iraq immoral. Springer made the remarks while breaking up a fight between a hooker and a deadbeat dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condoleezza Rice said there are no plans to invade North Korea. Which can mean only one thing. North Korea doesn't have any oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold in Washington, Marion Berry was using his crack pipe as a space heater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, for the inauguration tomorrow, they might need to use jumper cables to start both the President's limo and Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says being reelected doesn't have the same pressure as the first term. He says he wants to enjoy himself in the Oval Office this time. Not as much as Clinton enjoyed himself, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And security is unbelievable. They said the only Arabs that will be allowed into any of the parties will have to show proof that they own an oil well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of celebrities are complaining about the costs and glamour of the inauguration. They think the millions of dollars, instead of being spent on frivolous parties, could be put to better use. You know, like the Golden Globes, or the Peoples' Choice awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One embarrassing moment today during the rehearsal. They asked President Bush if he thought of his inauguration as being a 'gala event,' and Bush said, 'Hey, as long as none of them try to get married, it's fine with me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan says that the president's second inaugural speech...usually refers to all of their accomplishments of the past four years. So the good news, it should be a pretty short speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An article in the current issue of the New Yorker says that the next place the Bush Administration is planning to attack is Iran. Well, that seems like a mistake, doesn't it? Shouldn't we go after the Neverland Ranch first? Let's free those people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Schaffer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But everybody at the network is being very supportive of me guest hosting&quot; the Late Show &quot;tonight. CBS News sent over a forged congratulations letter, which was wonderful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visited the national archives, and he was shown an original copy of the US Constitution. When Bush saw the Constitution, he said, 'Look, it's that thing from Schoolhouse Rock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington, DC is on high alert for this week's inaugural of President Bush. Anti-aircraft missiles have been deployed near the Capitol. F-16 fighter jets are patrolling, and every bartender in the District has strict orders, do not serve the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm starting to worry about President Bush again. When aides told him that Condoleezza Rice had been confirmed today he said, 'I didn't even know she was Catholic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know, it was cold and bitter at the inauguration today. But enough about John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so cold, Bill Clinton had an intern blow on his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are criticizing President Bush for spending $40 million on this inauguration. But hey, give the guy a break. He's excited. You know, after all, this is the first time he's really been elected.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was sworn in on a Bible and Dick Cheney was sworn in on the 'Physician's Desk Reference' book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Cheney was sworn in a few minutes before President Bush. Did you know that? So technically, for like a few minutes, it's almost as if Dick Cheney were running the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment during the inauguration. When Chief Justice William Rehnquist told President Bush, &quot;Repeat after me,' and Bush said, 'After me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see William Rehnquist when he arrived? He was hunched over, he was wearing a big black beret, and he had that big oversized robe on. And when Clinton saw him from the back, he said, 'Monica?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about that commercial they were running? Was that rubbing it in? Show that commercial they ran all day.&quot; Commercial clip: &quot;The inaugural parade, $5 million. Catering for the inaugural ball, $10 million. Security for inauguration day, $22 million. John Kerry sitting in the cheap seats, priceless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his inaugural speech, President Bush pledged to make every person in the US an agent of their own destiny. Sounds way better than, 'Hey, we're broke! You're on your own! Yeah, good luck!'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoo -- security was tighter than Kirstie Alley in a pair of spandex pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say on the news there are over a dozen law enforcement agencies involved in security. I didn't even know there were a dozen law enforcement agencies. What, DC Police, FBI, maybe CIA, Army, national -- who else? 'The Incredibles?' Were they there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier tonight, the Bush Administration unveiled a new dance at the inaugural ball, the 'Iraqi Misstep.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is reporting a friend of President Bush is telling everyone that during the next four years, President Bush plans to be really aggressive. Really aggressive? In the past four years we've had, what, two wars? What, is he going to bomb Canada now? Is that the new plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post reporting that John Kerry and Al Gore are both going to run for president again in 2008. When Bush read it, he said, 'Great, now I can win a third term.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;32 Chinese illegal immigrants were found in cargo containers in LA harbor over the weekend. They were jammed into containers during a two-week journey from Hong Kong. So, apparently, they booked the trip on Priceline.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was in a great mood because of the inauguration. Senator Ted Kennedy, as a matter of fact, he was in such a great mood, he had a few too many cocktails. And he was writing his name in the snow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The security for the inauguration was very, very tight, very, very tight. The Bush twins, as a matter of fact, were stopped several times by Margarita-sniffing dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dignitaries from all over the world attended the inauguration with the exception of Prince Harry of England. Prince Harry could not be there, but he sent his greetings from his mountaintop bunker in Bavaria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it was exciting. All the former Democratic Presidents were there. You had Clinton, Carter, you had Gore. They were all there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was cold in Washington for the inauguration. So cold, President Carter built himself a shelter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear the President's inauguration address? Did you hear it? It was tremendous. He outlined a bold agenda and he also gave his Oscar picks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We have a calling from beyond the stars.' That's what President Bush said in his inauguration message earlier today. 'We have a calling from beyond the stars,' and you know what that means. He's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During President Bush's inaugural speech today, the President used the word freedom 27 times. Yeah. And 34 times, the President used the word 'okey-dokey.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney got out of his limo and walked part of the way. Yeah, or as Dick Cheney calls it, 'My 2005 workout.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is being criticized because his inaugural celebration cost $40 million. Yeah. When asked about it, the President said, 'Sorry, but my daughters insisted on an open bar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court voted 6-3 to legalize gay sex as long as it's casual sex. None of that married gay sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laura Bush had tears in her eyes. The President's mother, Barbara Bush, she had tears in her eyes. John Kerry, he had tears in his eyes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what is really kind of sad? Today, President Bush went back to Pennsylvania Avenue and sat in the reviewing stand. He thought there was going to be a parade every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Bill and Hillary at the inauguration? Did you see them sitting there? I mean, Bill is sitting there wishing it was 1996 and Hillary was sitting there wishing it was 2008.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an interesting piece of inauguration trivia. Do you know which of our elected Presidents had the shortest inauguration speech? Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a total of ten inaugural balls last night, and President Bush went to all ten. He even went to the Texas Air National Guard ball, but nobody recalled seeing him there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Michael Powell has resigned on the head of the FCC. Apparently wanted to get out before the next Super Bowl Halftime Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS says that after Dan Rather steps down, they may replace him with three anchors, one to read the news, the other two to check the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks see the inauguration ceremony last night? George W. Bush sworn in as President? I have to tell you ? it is starting to look really bad for John Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to tell you it was nice to see a president put his hand on a Bible instead of on an intern, wasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush's inauguration address was interrupted 27 times by applause and three times for vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, the inauguration was a huge success. President Bush raised $40 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a huge family night, big night for the Bush family. This morning the Bush twins woke up in Lincoln's lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, brought a camera to the inaugural festivities and was taking pictures the whole time. When asked why, Mrs. Bush said, 'Because my granddaughters won't remember any of this tomorrow.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see in Washington today, the parties have ended, the inauguration is over and it's back to business for President Bush -- that's right, today he left for a vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Religious groups are accusing Sponge Bob Square Pants of promoting homosexuality to children, which is wrong. That's the sort of thing that should be left up to the priests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NBC President ripped CBS today. He really went after us today. He called the Dan Rather incident a disgrace. The interview was cut short, though, when he had to run down to 'Fear Factor' to watch a rat-eating contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, what a year it's been for Massachusetts -- the Red Sox, the Patriots, John Kerry -- all right, two out of three. Two out of three's not bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the latest issue of Time magazine, it reports that President Bush is going to double the award for capturing Osama bin Laden from $25 million to $50 million. $50 million. Which sounds like a lot except when you realize the Mets spent $119 million to get Carlos Beltran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just five more days until the Iraqi elections. I'm going to make a prediction. I'm going to go out on a limb. I predict the winner will be a guy named Mohammed something, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennessee state Sen. John Ford, &quot;a Democrat, surprisingly -- is in court for child support, and he revealed he lives with his divorced wife and his kids three days a week. He's a Senator. He lives with his girlfriend and their two kids the other four days of the week. He's being sued by another girlfriend for child support. And his ex-wife is pregnant by him again.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in Washington, President Bush has asked Congress for another $80 billion to fight the war in Iraq. Another $80 billion. Wouldn't it be cheaper to just buy Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans say they plan to press for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Because the founding fathers intended gay sex to be very casual. They don't want it to be married.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore's film, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' did not get one nomination for an Oscar. Not one. In fact, today President Bush said, 'Does this mean I can't get best actor now?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five of the 20 acting nominations went to African Americans. In fact, listen to this ? Condoleezza Rice is up for best actress for her line, 'I'm looking forward to working with Barbara Boxer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The value of the dollar continues to plummet. A dollar is now worth so little, CBS has offered me a raise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the folks at the White House, the Federal budget deficit is now a whopping $427 billion. For a guy who quit drinking, President Bush surely knows how to run up a tab, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Won't that be tricky for the real estate agents? 'We have a lovely Cape Cod, three bedroom. It's in the 'Triangle of Death' area.' Maybe 'Iraqi Rolling Hills Estates,' something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book, female officers at Guant?namo Bay would sometimes wear just a thong when they interrogated these Iraqi prisoners in order to make them uncomfortable. They just put on a thong. Is that the best way to get at the truth? Usually when a guy sees a woman in a thong, he starts lying. 'I'm not married. Yeah, I'm just hanging out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story is the Iraqis are voting worldwide. Absentee ballot in this Sunday's elections. They're voting in the United States, voting in France, voting in London, voting in Australia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only place they're not voting, Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, Iraqis are voting in US cities like Washington, DC, and Detroit. The amazing thing is, there's more gunfire in those cities than there are in Fallujah and Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think a lot of people in Iraq are wearing those little 'I voted' stickers today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some Iraqi politicians have been telling voters if they don't vote for them, they will go to hell. Imagine using religion to try and get votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, on just her second day on the job, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice named Barbara Boxer ambassador to Fallujah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Engelbert Humperdinck says that he cheated with over 3,000 women, and his wife of over 40 years is fine with it, because she said it was less work for her. And today, Bill Clinton got an autographed copy of the book for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Vice President Dick Cheney, who turns 64 this Sunday. Isn't that lovely? Oh, lovely. He plans to spend the day with his loved ones, Shell and Exxon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government, in Washington today, the government said they may soon tax plastic surgery. The tax is projected to make more than $500 million a year. $500 million a year. And that's just from Cher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations, by the way, to Condoleezza Rice, who today was confirmed as Secretary of State. This makes Rice the most powerful black woman in the country -- next to Oprah, of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, election day, of course, you know, in Iraq. And I thought this was odd. Out of force of habit, John Kerry gave a concession speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turnout was very high. In some places, 90% of the population voted. Amazing. They said it will take about ten days to finalize the results, which is pretty good when you consider that's still twice as fast as they do it in Florida.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, these people in Iraq, I mean, they risked their lives to vote. Terrorist snipers, car bombs, grenade launchers. Over here, we're like, 'I was gonna vote, but, like, you have to drive there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Condoleezza Rice was urging people to go to the voting booths in Iraq. Especially Barbara Boxer. She really wanted her to go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election was such a success, today Dick Cheney said, 'We're so close to that oil, I can taste it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is pretty happy with the turnout, as well. In fact, today Bush showed a new map of Iraq with the provinces laid out as they voted. So as you can see, the reds, and you can see the blue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Iraq, do you know they return to the polls for another round of voting later in the year? Did you know that? Six months, they go back again. So it's basically the same Shiite, different day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he wants another $80 billion in military funding. So when he said Iraq isn't free yet, he's not kidding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book, prisoners at Guant?namo Bay were questioned by female intelligence officers wearing thongs. Did you hear this story? They were wearing thongs. Here's my question -- where the hell are those pictures, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard -- Hillary Clinton has a new campaign slogan. 'I've fallen, and I can't get up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At an appearance in Buffalo, New York, she wasn't feeling well, fainted, fell over. And, God bless him, Bill was there. He immediately started giving mouth-to-mouth -- to another woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they checked Hillary's temperature, it was up to 34 degrees. You know, so they were ? 'Oh, my God.' It's right above freezing. And they were a little frightened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say the Eagles are a long shot&quot; in the Super Bowl, &quot;but the new Iraqi leader has a better chance of not getting killed this Sunday, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry &quot;was criticized for throwing away his military service medals back in the 70s. So, not to be outdone, today President Bush threw away his National Guard spotty attendance ribbon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was overseas, he was in Rome, he was visiting the Pope. Did you see those photos? Oh, my God, the poor guy, he looked old, he looked confused, like he didn't know where he was. And then the Pope told Bush to relax and enjoy himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On his way back, President Bush stopped in Canada where he received a cool reception. But on the bright side, he was able to go to a Canadian drugstore and fill his prescriptions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saddam Hussein is &quot;apparently out of it. He kept asking, when is Sean Penn coming back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Mint has released the new California state quarter. On one side is Governor Schwarzenegger's head. On the other side is the rest of his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news out of Iraq today. Voter turnout was higher than expected yesterday. The big losers were the terrorists. In fact, they've changed the name from Al Qaeda to Al Gore. That's how much they lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to government auditors, the US occupation authority in Iraq has misplaced $9 billion. Yeah. You know where I think they should look for the $9 billion? Underneath the weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A scary moment earlier today. Hillary Clinton fainted during a speech. She's fine. Here's what I don't understand. Why was Bill giving mouth-to-mouth to her assistant? What is that all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The elections in Iraq are being called a huge success. You see all the Iraqi people dancing in the streets? Wasn't that amazing? I had no idea the Iraqis were such bad dancers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Iraqi citizens here in the United States, they voted in the election as well. In fact, a lot of Iraqis in Chicago voted seven or eight times, I understand.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he was very happy with the results of the election. He was even more pleased that Provision 26, legalizing gay marriage in Mosul, was defeated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq they did not release the names of the candidates until two days before the election. To protect the candidates, they didn't even tell you who is running until two days before the election. Why can't we do that here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorists in Iraq claimed they kidnapped a US soldier. They even released a video showing a US soldier with a gun to his head. It turns out the soldier was just a toy doll, a GI Joe doll. But it was shot from a distance so it looked real. The whole news story was fake. Oh, nice to see Dan Rather working again, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post is reporting that CBS is thinking of adding a comedian to the nightly news when Dan Rather steps down. You know, like an Andy Rooney kind of thing every night? So we'll have comedy in the news. How embarrassing is that for Dan, you know? 'Dan, I'm sorry, you have to step down because of a lack of credibility. We're going to bring in Carrot Top to help.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton collapsed yesterday. Apparently, even she couldn't believe how well the elections in Iraq went.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one embarrassing moment, though, when she collapsed. Although she was only out for a few minutes, when she came to, Bill was halfway through her eulogy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Detainees at Guantanamo Bay -- they claim that one of the methods used to get them to talk was that a female interrogator would question them wearing thong underwear. Yeah, I believe that's called good cop/great cop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Congressional Budget Office, Social Security will be completely depleted, completely broke, by the year 2052. Once again, I don't think President Bush understands these issues. He said, '2052? That's okay; by then all our old people will already be dead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a quick reminder for all Iraqis watching. The crooked voting machines are due back in Florida by Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a bounty on Osama bin Laden. $25 million. And they've now doubled it $50 million. ... It makes sense because if you are a goat farmer in Tora Bora, $25 million is just not going to get your attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turning our attention to North Korea, dictator Kim Jong Il said when he retires he is looking forward to turning the power over to his son. You know his son, Mental-li Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over in Iraq, United States authorities have admitted that $9 billion is missing. Wow! They've misplaced $9 billion in Iraq. That's crazy, isn't it. I'm fairly confident they'll find it. It's probably somewhere with the weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difference between George W. Bush's first term and the George W. Bush second term as we see it coming. The first term: Naps from 2 pm to 5 pm. Second term: Naps from 2 pm to 6 pm.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first term: Lies to get us into war with Iraq. Second term: Lies to get us out of the war with Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first term: Criticized for spending too much time vacationing on Texas ranch. Second term: Will spend more time vacationing at Kennebunkport beach house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;he first term: Vows To one day put a man on Mars. Second term: Vows to one day put a man on Liza Minnelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turnout for the election in Iraq was higher than expected with 60% of Iraqis casting votes. Isn't that great? 60%, 60%, yeah. President Bush said don't worry. Once their democracy is as sophisticated as ours that number should drop to 40%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor of Baghdad said he'd like to erect a statue of President Bush in the middle of the city. Yeah, then the mayor of Baghdad said, 'Unfortunately, there no longer is the middle of the city.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton fainted. Yeah, yeah, she fainted. Apparently Hillary fainted after she came home and found her husband alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about the big mix-up in the Iraqi elections. Apparently, by mistake, a lot of ballots were switched with NBA all-star ballots. Yeah. Now the president of Iraq is Yao Ming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an upcoming book, female officers at Guantanamo Bay would wear thongs when they interrogated the Iraqi prisoners to make them feel uncomfortable. ... Isn't that kind of insulting to the female officers? 'Look, we've got to frighten this guy into talking.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Medicare drug plan will now include Viagra for seniors. Viagra is now covered under Medicare. So now everything's covered. Arthritis if you're too stiff, Viagra if you're not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush's State of the Union speech &quot;was interrupted 40 times by applause. 40 times by applause. And twice to look up a word in the dictionary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the State of the Union address, Bush also announced his visionary plan to bring peace to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Anniston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top ten surprises in George W. Bush's State of the Union address: &quot;10. Instead of 'Hail to the Chief,' Marine band played 50 Cent's 'In Da Club.' 9. Began with wacky comedy skit about Hillary Clinton fainting then yelled, 'Live from New York it's Saturday night.' 8. For first 5 minutes, President wandered aimlessly looking for his shadow. 7. Didn't bother to take off his iPod. 6. His curious decision to wear t-shirt: 'The more I learn about women, the more I love my truck.' 5. President paused frequently to sip from Big Gulp. 4. His nunchucks wizardry. 3. His tearful plea to Brad and Jennifer to work things out. 2. The guy wouldn't shut up about 'Meet The Fockers.' 1. When he accidentally 'outed' Rumsfeld.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historians say that most presidents have begun their State of the Union address by saying, 'The State of the Union is strong.' That's how they usually start it. However, President Bush started his speech a bit differently. He said, 'The State of the Union is Strongtastic.' Then he wandered away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on Good Morning America, First Lady Laura Bush said that Jenna Bush's new boyfriend is not a serious boyfriend. Yeah, yeah. Laura Bush described him as more of a drinking buddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS announced that they would temporarily replace 72-year-old Dan Rather with 67-year-old Bob Schieffer. It is all part of CBS' effort to attract younger viewers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know last night President Bush gave his State of the Union address. In a related story, John Kerry rented Shrek 2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President congratulated all the brave Iraqi voters who made, you know, this last Sunday's election a tremendous success. Bush said despite being shot at, you all made it to the polls. He was just talking about the Iraqis in Detroit.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people dipped their fingers in purple ink to show their solidarity for the Iraqi voters. Did you see Dick Cheney? He had five fingers that were purple. Then they realized, oh, that's just from poor circulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the Boston Globe today, they said in his speech, President Bush came off as a combination of Winston Churchill and Bill Clinton. Two different ways to use the cigar, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You always love, the Democrats -- did you see Hillary? Could she look more bored? You see her sitting there in she looked like she was sitting through another one of Bill Clinton's alibis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush made his case for Social Security reform. So if you happen to be holding a Social Security check, you might want to cash it first thing in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think you should be able to invest part of your social security in the stock market? Do you think it's a good idea? A lot of critics say it's too risky. See, we need to put our money in something that's a sure thing. Like the Patriots beating the Eagles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's nominee for Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, was approved by the Senate. For a while it looked like he wasn't going to make it. Then a group of senators changed their vote after they were dragged into a room and forced to form a naked pyramid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw President Bush last night during the State of the Union address? How many of you? Here's how dumb I am. I watched the whole thing, I have no idea what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what happened. Early on, my dog steps on the remote. And I had to listen to the rest of the speech in Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a long, dull speech. Listen to this, halfway through the long, dull speech, Ted Kennedy sent drinks over to the Bush twins. That long, that dull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, more people watched American Idol than the State of the Union. It's absolutely true. It's absolutely true. Next year the speech will be delivered by Ryan Seacrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess people who rather watch someone who can't sing rather than someone who can't speak...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has proposed an increase in the Federal tax on airline tickets to pay for additional security. Well, that's good news. Now it will cost you extra to have your wife felt up at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This of course is Presidents' Day. This is the day we honor our presidents by secretly taping them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about these Bush tapes? Oh, this is unbelievable. It seems a friend, a friend -- what a friend this guy is -- of the Bush family, a guy named Doug Wead ? I think he's Linda Tripp's first husband, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has a book coming out -- surprise, surprise -- secretly taped a number of conversations. And he had -- with Bush, when Bush was thinking of running for president in '98, he taped the conversations secretly. And on the tape, Bush admits as a young man he smoked marijuana. But he quit, you know, when it started to interfere with his drinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he acknowledges trying marijuana. And here's the interesting part. No one has come forward to verify they ever actually saw him do marijuana. So it's like the National Guard thing all over again, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So now Bush, Clinton and Gore have all admitted to smoking marijuana. This is like a presidential version of the Doobie Brothers. That's basically what we have here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, this Wead guy said he never intended for the tapes to become public. Who would have thought that going to the New York Times and playing them for a reporter would make them become public?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 7-year-old Kyoto Accord went into effect this week, forcing 35 nations of the European Union to cut emissions in an effort to combat, you know, the global warming. See, again, President Bush, I don't think he understands these issues. Like today, when they asked him about the Kyoto Accord, he said, 'You know, I prefer the Camry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, by the way, is in Europe, he'll be going to Brussels, Germany, and Amsterdam to get some primo weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In these tapes, President Bush admits that at one time he tried marijuana. And that's not all, you think that's stunning, there's also a secret tape of Osama bin Laden and he admits at one time trying pork.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A friend of George W. Bush secretly taped Bush? That's crazy. And I know what you're all thinking, you're all thinking, well, how the hell did somebody trick George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top ten good things about having the same name as a president: &quot;10. Andrew Jackson: When I withdraw money from the bank, instead of asking for twenties, I ask for 'me's'. 9. James Garfield: Every morning as I walk into Radio Shack, my co-workers have to play 'Hail To The Chief'. 8. George Washington: I get the History Channel for free. 7. William Henry Harrison: I don't just say no when my wife wants to redo the kitchen ? I veto it. 6. William McKinley: Surefire pickup line: 'Want to Mount McKinley'? 5. Richard Nixon: Nothing. 4. William Clinton: I always get VIP treatment at strip clubs. 3. Zachary Taylor: I'm named after the guy who...actually, I'd never heard of him until today. 2. Thomas Jefferson: When I show up at Colonial Williamsburg, I get more tail than Frank Sinatra. 1. George W. Bush: It's fun to buy rounds for everyone and send the tab to the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, President Bush met with the king of Belgium. They got off to a rocky start this morning when the President said, 'I love your waffles.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new poll asking people who they'd vote for if George Washington ran against President Bush, George Washington won by 20%. That's good. So counting Al Gore, that would be the second time Bush lost to a dead guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this sleazeball guy named Doug Wead, a former friend of President Bush? The guy who taped him -- made the tapes? Actually, he is a former Assembly of God minister who was Bush's kind of contact to the Evangelical community, and he secretly taped President Bush's phone conversations for, like, three years. Turns out, the guy -- and he's a real student of Bible, especially the stories about Judas. Apparently he knows those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he thought it was moral to record someone who is destined for greatness. That's the same excuse Paris Hilton's boyfriend used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out there are now 12 different tapes of President Bush, and today Bush said, 'Cool, that's three more than bin Laden's got out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wead &quot;said he never intended for these tapes to be made public. But why did he go to the New York Times? See what I'm saying? If he didn't want them to become public, he should have gone on 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos.' Then he would've been sure no one would ever see them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush said he would never answer that question because he wants to set a good example for kids. He doesn't ever want them to say, 'Hey Daddy, President Bush tried marijuana, so I will.' So, now instead, when parents say, 'Son, you been smoking dope?' They can go, 'Hey Daddy, President Bush didn't answer that question, and I'm not going to answer it either.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A state Assemblyman, here in California, has introduced a 'compassionate care law' which will allow California to become the second state in the nation to allow assisted suicides. Again, do we need this? Between the floods, the earthquakes, the crime -- living here is assisted suicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today, President Bush said that contrary to reports, he has no plans to attack Iran. Yeah. He's not going to attack Iran, yeah. The President said, 'That's ridiculous. We didn't even have plans when we attacked Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Senator Hillary Clinton visited Iraq to boost morale. Yeah. Yeah, and apparently it worked because former President Clinton has never been in a better mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was this week in 1836 that Texas declared its independence from Mexico. California is now thinking about doing the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow! What a crowd. You sound like President Bush when you heard tonight was Dan Rather's last broadcast.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather stepped down tonight. I don't know what he's going to do. I think we've ruled out joining the Texas Air National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question: Who quits on a Wednesday? The guy's been there 24 years. He can't stay two more half-hours?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I think Dan's still a little bitter that he had to step down. His last words tonight were, 'Hey, President Bush, bite me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Our prayers go out to President Clinton. He's going in the hospital tomorrow for surgery. Not too serious, just to remove scar tissue from his heart. Doctors say it's a low-risk, somewhat routine operation. In fact, each year they do thousands of these, and that's just on Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A new survey says 50% of people are unhappy with their job. You know why? Because their job is now in India. That's why they're unhappy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Dan Rather says now that he's stepped down as anchor of the CBS Evening News, he wants to spend more time with his grandchildren. I thought that was sweet. Sadly, his grandchildren would rather hang out with Peter Jennings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger impressed a crowd in Washington because he gave a 40-minute speech without any notes. When asked what Arnold spoke about, the crowd said, 'How the hell should we know?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in surgery for four hours today under a general anesthetic. And when he finally opened his eyes and saw Hillary standing there, he thought, 'Oh my God, I've died and gone to hell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was Dan Rather's last night as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News. But he's not leaving show business. He's going on to host the new 'Ripley's Believe It Or Not.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the New York Times, a commission due to report to President Bush this month will claim that our intelligence regarding Iran's weapon program is inadequate. And today Bush said, 'Hey, good enough for me. Let's invade!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is something very bizarre. In an interview in GQ magazine, Russell Crowe says that al Qaeda had plans to kidnap him four years ago. But luckily, our American diplomats convinced al Qaeda to leave Russell Crowe alone, and just take Jean-Claude van Damme instead.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that creepy? Human corpses as crash test dummies? Well, think about it. You know how hard it is, really, for a corpse to find work? Look at Al Gore. He's been out of a job, for what, six years? I mean, he still hasn't found a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush is back from Afghanistan, where she was this week to talk to women about literacy. And in Washington, President Bush was asked about the literacy problem. See, I don't think he understands it. Like, today, he said, 'We could solve literacy if every American just picked up just one piece of paper every day and put it in the trash.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush's approval rating is now the lowest it has ever been. In fact, here is how unpopular President Bush is right now. Today, the US told Bush they're pulling out of the coalition.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in the Oval Office, President Bush met with Ukrainian President Yushchenko.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health and law enforcement officials in New Jersey are holding the largest counterterrorism drill in history by simulating a biological, chemical and toxic weapons attack on New Jersey.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tampa Bay Devil Ray outfielder, Alex Sanchez, yesterday became the first player to be suspended under baseball's tough new policy. He got a ten-day suspension after testing positive for either steroids or some other performance enhancing drug. Here's the amazing thing. You know how many homers this guy hit last year? Two. He's on steroids, he only hit two? Give him a refill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Major League Baseball -- oh, they say they're serious, they are serious about this policy. In fact, they said that if Barry Bonds or Jason Giambi ever test positive for steroids, Sanchez will get another ten day suspension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to give our best to the Reverend Jerry Falwell. He has been feeling much better after being taken to the hospital last week. He's doing much better. Doctors upgraded his condition from critical to judgmental.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment when the doctors asked Falwell if he had an HMO. He said, 'No, I condemn that lifestyle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of parents are very upset about this. Most American teenagers say they don't consider oral sex as having sex at all. Today, Bill Clinton said, 'See!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just Canadians. You know, if we Americans, if we go to Canada or Mexico now, we have to show a passport to get back in our own country.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating, an all-time low. 45%. Pretty bad. He's very concerned about this. In fact, he's trying to get it back up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS News has won a Peabody Award for its coverage of the scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the World Bank announced, today, that the United States and the world economy peaked, it peaked in the year 2004. Come you know what that means?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what happened when President Bush was shown on the giant TV screens during the Pope's funeral today. The crowd at the Vatican booed. Yeah, when President Bush heard this, 'He asked what does 'boo' mean in Italian?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Executives at the Fox News Channel announced they're going start a Fox News financial channel. Yeah, the Fox News financial channel will be different because whenever the stock market goes down, they'll blame it on Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Tom DeLay is in a little bit of trouble. He said he didn't know, he had no idea that lobbying groups were illegally funding the trips he took all over the world. Don't you love this one? When these guys are running for office, they always tell us how smart they are, how knowledgeable they are, how they know what's going on. As soon as they get caught doing something wrong, 'I'm an idiot. I didn't know what was going on. I was completely clueless to any of this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today that we are streamlining our intelligence gathering capabilities. We can get information quicker and process it sooner. In fact, today, the CIA today announced they believe the Pope may be dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a very scary moment in Washington yesterday. You probably saw this on the news. Capitol Hill police tackled -- tackled and dragged away a desperate man with two suitcases. See that guy?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Bolton is &quot;President Bush's nominee, the ambassador to the United Nations. Well, this guy ripped into him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on Air Force One on the way to the Pope's funeral last week, former President Bill Clinton told reporters, he said, 'Like many of us, the Pope may have a mixed legacy.' You can understand why Clinton would think the Pope would have a mixed legacy. I mean, on the hand, John Paul was what? The spiritual leader to millions, billions of Catholics. On the other hand, he clung to a lot of outdated rules. You know, thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not bear false witness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like we're going to be in Iraq for years to come. You know, I was thinking about this. If we can come up with a phony reason to go in, why can't we come up with a phony reason to come out?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that big scare they had in Washington, DC, earlier this week.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday down in Washington DC, the Feds jumped a guy who was behaving suspiciously and he was carrying two large suitcases. So they jumped and they arrested him and it turns out, kind of had a funny ending him. Thank God, he's not a terrorist. And the suitcases were full of cash for Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals' first game at RFK Stadium. The umpire called it a ball and Bush appealed it to his friends on the Supreme Court. They made it a strike. So, it worked out okay. They said the pitch was high and to the right, just like President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jose Canseco said in his book that when President Bush was a baseball owner, he had to know about steroids. Bush said no, he didn't know. So, apparently even back then he was getting his information from the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Howard Dean is out trying to rally the Democrats for 2008. This is what he told them -- he spoke quite honestly.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC now claiming they have a hit with this new miniseries, 'Revelations.' Have you seen it, 'Revelations?' They say it's loosely based on the Bible. See, they have to say loosely because, in Hollywood, no one actually has a Bible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cardinals said they had to be very careful in the process of electing a new pope, because the pope will be interpreting God's laws for them. You know, kind of the way Republican leaders do for us in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

This is a legal form of prostitution over there, where a man and a woman have a formal contract that he'll pay her to have sex with him and they say these contracts can be anywhere from an hour to ten years. Well, that's got to be quite a negotiation, huh? I mean, the woman's going, 'How 'bout ten years?' The guy's going, 'Uh, how 'bout an hour, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the White House and the Capitol building were briefly evacuated after a small plane drifted into restricted airspace. Yeah, things got very tense. Yeah, police chased down the plane and identified the pilot -- runaway bride, Jennifer Willbanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more information's coming out about those two pilots. Remember they forced the evacuation of Washington the other day? Those two guys? Turns out, completely innocent. They said what happened was, they were navigating by sight, and they got lost. It's the middle of the day. How about looking down?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, the sky is clear. You can't see the Capitol building? You don't see the giant Washington Monument? I mean, what was the first clue? The F-16 strafing the side of the plane?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, is that supposed to be comforting to us? Oh, they weren't terrorists. Luckily they were just idiots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad news, the Pentagon announced they're closing more than 150 military bases around the country. You know, if the Bush Administration wants to close military bases, how about starting with the ones in Iraq?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this has been a long time coming. You know when President Bush first thought about closing military bases? When he was in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton made an appearance this week with Newt Gingrich to push a health care measure. The press is making a big thing of this with Newt. But, hey, if anyone knows how to appear in public with a man she can't stand, it's Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The republican Mayor from Spokane, Washington -- I love this story -- Jim West, who is being investigated for various sex offenses, said yesterday -- this is his quote, this is what the Mayor said. He said, 'I have never masturbated in my office.' Well, that's quite an accomplishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, hey -- you snicker, but even a former president of the United States can't make that claim. So, hey, that's pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;60th anniversary of the end of World War II, ladies and gentlemen, end of World War II. You folks remember World War II. That was the war where our troops defeated the ruthless tyrant and then we actually left.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was spotted carrying around a book, and he told reporters he started reading the book four months ago. Yeah. And, apparently, he still hasn't found Waldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that real estate prices in Baghdad, real estate prices in Baghdad have quadrupled in the last two years, which means that a 2,000 square foot home will now cost you $4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's nominee for UN Ambassador, John Bolton, is in danger of being rejected by the Senate because he's known for abusing subordinates and frequently losing his temper.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I just found out, you know what the toughest job in the world, anybody know? Trying to sell subscriptions to Newsweek in Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek has apologized now for publishing the story...that US interrogators at Guantanamo Bay flushed a copy of the Koran down the toilet. Turns out the story is not true. The reporters, of course, will be punished the usual way -- they will be given jobs at CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that the Newsweek report has 'damaged the US image overseas.' Believe me, when it comes to damaging the US image overseas, the White House knows what it's talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it caused a huge riot in Afghanistan. They torched buildings, they burned the American flag. Well, now that the story's turned out to be false, I'm sure these same people will take to the streets any minute to apologize for burning our flag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condoleezza Rice, currently on a goodwill tour of Iraq, surrounded by armed guards. She was in an armored vehicle taken down a secret route to avoid attack. And that's just while she was on the freeway here in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a biodiesel plant in Richmond, Virginia, President Bush came out for alternative fuels. He wants to see more use of alternative fuels, that's good. He said he looks forward to the day when America will invade a country just because it has soybeans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conservative anti-gay, very anti-gay, Mayor of Spokane, Washington -- turns out that -- Jim West is his name -- I think it's 'Jim West Hollywood,' actually. But turns out he's now being investigated for giving jobs to gay men he met on a gay chat line. In his defense, the Mayor said, 'This is a case of one hand not knowing who the other hand was doing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a USA Today poll, 90% of people say prayer works very well for them in curing pain. Which is also the Republican health care plan. Keep prayin'!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are comparisons being made between Darth Vader and President Bush. I don't see that. Do you? Bush as Darth Vader? Maybe Cheney.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam Hussein in prison and writing his personal memoir. And he will describe his relationship with his three sons Uday, Qusay, and Little Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a memoir by Saddam Hussein, it's I believe -- he is the first jailed dictator to write a book since, well, Martha Stewart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quick question, how many people are only here because you used to live on a military base and now you have nowhere else to go?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the military's new slogan, 'An Army of One -- Base.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Rumsfeld went a little crazy. What did they close, 180 bases? Shut down an Air Force base -- where it, was it in South Dakota? Shutting down a Navy base in Mississippi. You know, why don't we first shut down Neverland Ranch? That's one -- we need to close that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is 'Reading is Fun' week. Unless, of course, you're a devout Muslim in Afghanistan with Newsweek. Then it's a little depressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know by now Newsweek has apologized for running a story where they said US soldiers flushed a copy of the Koran down the toilet. In fact, when President Bush heard this, man, he was outraged. He said, 'Look, I don't like books either, but that's no reason to flush them down the toilet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House still very upset about this. They said Newsweek should have retracted the story as soon as they found out they got their facts wrong. And listen, hey, if we pulled back every time we got our facts wrong, we wouldn't even be in Iraq now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the newest issue of Newsweek. This is the actual one -- this came out. Kind of ironic, isn't it? Sweet cover story about George Washington, the guy who couldn't tell a lie. Kind of interesting that they would pick [him].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US military strategists say we are closer than ever to finding Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden? We can't even find Dave Chappelle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was at a biodiesel plant in Richmond, Virginia, this week where he spoke out in favor of alternative fuels. Bush says he's all for alternative fuels, as long as they don't try to get married.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biodiesel, wasn't that Janet Reno's Secret Service codename?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The buzz in Washington [is] saying Vice President Dick Cheney considering running in 2008. Not for president, just exercising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans to fight terrorism with Britain's first national identification card since World War II. See, in Britain they have to use ID cards because nobody over there has any dental records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Army and the Marines both missed their recruiting goals at end of April. Not good, not good. In fact, they said right now, the only ones successfully recruiting young men, Paula Abdul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek had to retract a report about the Koran, and the article caused a violent anti-US rioting in Muslim countries. And that's too bad, because up until now they really loved us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story, you know? Newsweek magazine in deep Shiite this week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Newsweek' printed a story without checking the facts. You know, it's amazing. In the past few years, the New York Times has had fake stories. CBS had fake stories. Now Newsweek has had fake stories. Do you realize the only one that hasn't had to print a retraction? The National Inquirer.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is furious. He is so angry at Newsweek, he said he's not even going to pretend to read it any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Newsweek, God bless them, they're trying to make good on their mistake. They said today, that they'll offer full refunds to any Muslims that send back the unused portion of the magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the Pentagon shutting down 180 military bases around the country. 180. The Bush Administration says the closing of the bases will enable us to save enough money to fund another unnecessary war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday is the day when millions and millions voted. But enough about 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday we voted for mayor. Not a lot of people turned out to vote. Pretty depressing. In fact, I drove past a polling station. It was emptier than the LA library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, we have a new mayor. His name is Antonio Villaraigosa. Antonio Villaraigosa. You know, it's bad enough we can't spell the governor's name. Now we can't spell the mayor's name either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Villaraigosa gave a great speech. He said that even though he's the city's first Latino Mayor in over 133 years -- he will still reach out to the three remaining Anglo voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ohio Senator George Voinovich agreed to send John Bolton's nomination as UN Ambassador to the Senate floor -- where he says he'll vote against him. He's voting for the guy before he votes against him. John Kerry may have found his next running mate, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor Dick Cheney may run for president in 2008. If he wins that would make him the first three-term president since Franklin Roosevelt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on at world's busiest airport -- Bangor, Maine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happen again yesterday. An Air Italia flight from Milan to Boston was diverted because of the security risk. They sent them to Bangor, Maine. Apparently, they found out a guy from Newsweek may have [been] on the flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the premiere of the Star Wars film at Cannes, there were comparisons being made between Darth Vader and President Bush. Have you heard this? They're comparing the movie to President Bush. Also talk about President Bush's brother; they call him the evil 'Jebi' master.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here on Monday night, we aired our 'Hercules' movie. We couldn't have been prouder. What a turkey that thing was. Anybody? Stupid movie. Though, I did enjoy the final scene where Hercules finally becomes governor of California.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, at this time I would like to retract last night's show. And we apologize for the rioting it caused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was such a slow news day, that Newsweek couldn't even make up a story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was saying today, talking to people, talking to the press, taking to various people and he said, 'I wish I could wave a magic wand and lower gas prices.' Then he said, 'I wish I could wave a magic wand and bring the troops home.' Then he said, 'I wish I could wave a magic wand and fix health care.' And I was thinking, 'Boy, this guy waves his wand more than Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with former South Africa President Nelson Mandela. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Yeah, Mandela said that he was pleased to meet the President, while Bush said it was a thrill to finally meet Bernie Mac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Newsweek had to retract a story that suggested US interrogators flushed the Koran down a toilet and that story sparked riots around the world. So Newsweek had to give a retraction. A spokesman for Newsweek said, 'We didn't realize Muslim fanatics took their religion so seriously.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very proud here in Los Angeles. We have a new Mayor, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is our new Mayor. First Latino Mayor in over 132 years. You know something?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in TV news, CBS has canceled '60 Minutes II,' which means Dan Rather lost another job. Yeah. If I understand, there's an opening at Newsweek. So, he might go there. He might go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a 'Star Wars' movie opens up, people call in sick. They don't go to work. How many folks called in sick to go see 'Star Wars?' See, that's exactly right. Even the guy who writes the phony stories for 'Newsweek,' he phoned in sick today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he is still angry at Newsweek magazine for a story they ran about the Army interrogators flushing a Koran down the toilet.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, voters in Los Angeles elected a new Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. That's right. Yeah, voters admitted that they only voted for Villaraigosa because they wanted to hear Schwarzenegger pronounce it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of critics are now saying Darth Vader is like President Bush. ... I don't know. You think that's fair? You think that's true? Darth Vader like Bush. I don't think so. Napoleon Dynamite, maybe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a strange catalog in the mail today. 'Saddam's Secret' catalog, have you seen this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These pictures of Saddam Hussein in his underpants, all over the news today. Actually, look how -- see how trim he looks? He actually lost some weight. That's the trimmest I've ever seen him. In fact, today Kirstie Alley checked herself into an Iraqi prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor in Washington, Dick Cheney may run for president. Well, let's hope that's just a Newsweek story, huh?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Cheney says he wants to run because there's a lot of unfinished business. Like, did you know there are still a lot of countries in the world that don't hate us yet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In TV news, CBS has canceled 'JAG.' They didn't want to but, Donald Rumsfeld closed their base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A beautiful day in New York City today, so incredibly beautiful, over at Newsweek, as a matter of fact, so lovely today they were out on the roof making up stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is probably the best one yet, it is 'Attack of the Sith.' And the whole crew is back, Mace Windu, Chewbacca, Jar Jar Binks, Count Dooku -- no, no, wait a minute that is Iraq's new governing council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saddam Hussein is &quot;still in jail and he's writing his memoir all about his life as an evil dictator. And he's going to promote it, honestly. This is the craziest thing, he is already going to promote it. Next week he will attend a book signing at Barnes &amp; Evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know this story. A tabloid newspaper in England published a picture of Saddam Hussein in his underwear. And today, the same tabloid newspaper issued an apology that said, 'Saddam? We thought it was Camilla. We had no idea.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody's making a big deal out of the picture of Saddam and his underwear. I saw the picture two weeks ago when he put it on Match.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people in the Middle East are pretty angry about the picture. How would we like it if our leader was caught the without his pants on? Uh, been there, done that, duh! Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see all of those people in Jerusalem chanting anti-American slogans and yelling at First Lady Laura Bush about how evil her husband is? It was awful. Looked like Oscar night in Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well the FBI said today that that hand grenade thrown near President Bush -- remember when he was visiting Russia? -- it was real and could have exploded.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Army has a new program that will allow soldiers to leave the service a couple of years before their full four-year enlistment is up. This is based on a plan developed by President Bush when he was in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate finally reached a compromise to allow President Bush's candidates to be voted on without a filibuster. Everyone's been talking about this. Yeah. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a number of TV watchdog groups have filed complaints against Carl's Jr restaurants for that ad with Paris Hilton in it, calling it soft core pornography. Give you an idea how racy that is, Carl Sr won't even let Carl Jr watch it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to mention this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course, the big story everywhere, while we were off last week. The big story is, Deep Throat has gone public. Yep, Paris Hilton's getting married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's true, you know, Deep Throat, the main source in the Watergate investigation has been identified. Which would be big news if it was 1975.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you sure you probably know, as it turns out that Deep Throat is a 91 -- 91-- year-old former FBI agent named Mark Felt. Oh yeah, I saw this coming all along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, President Bush was shocked when he heard the news. He said, 'What? Deep Throat was a guy? Ew!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family of the 91-year-old former FBI agent now trying to get a book deal. Yeah, nothing like striking while the iron's hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, actually, you know, Deep Throat was the biggest mystery in Washington since how the Clintons stayed together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those of you who are too young to remember the Deep Throat incident, it was about the Watergate break-in back in 1972, when the Republicans broke into the Watergate hotel to see what the Democrats were up to. See, back in those days, the Democrats actually had some ideas worth stealing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love politicians. Politicians, you give them lemons, they always try to make lemonade out of it. Tennessee state Senator John Ford caught in an investigation. This guy is under house-arrest after being caught in an FBI sting operation. He was forced to resign on Saturday. Ford said, this is his quote, 'I plan to spend the rest of my time with my family.' Spend time with his family? He's under house arrest. That's his sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush held a press conference at the White House with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. President Bush likes holding press conferences with British Prime Minister Blair because he doesn't have to use an interpreter.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Blair still needs one to understand Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the topics they discussed was debt relief for Africa. President Bush unveiled his plan. He wants to give everyone in Africa a tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 35 years of secrecy, John Kerry's college transcripts from Yale were released today. He had worse grades than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it's true. Kerry got four Ds his freshman year. His four-year grade point average was lower than President Bush's. How embarrassing is that? I mean, you get lower grades than Bush, and Bush was drunk at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry was getting Ds, but he was sober. I'm not quite sure what you make of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled against the use of medical marijuana. The good news, at least they waited until after the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical marijuana users say they're going to appeal this ruling, but not today because it's, like, really nice out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know where I think the marijuana advocates made their big mistake was during their arguments, they kept referring to the Supreme Court justices as 'dudes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the trial of Saddam Hussein is getting under way soon in Iraq and I've got to testify in that one, too. I tell you that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to hang with Uday and Qusay. And the third brother, What-You-Say, you know him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the E! Channel's going to be doing re-enactments of this trial every night. I believe Saddam will be played by Bea Arthur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how hot it was today in New York City, it was so hot, Deep Throat met with Ben and Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently now they came up with John Kerry's college grades, his record in college, and it was surprising. His average, John Kerry, while he was in college, was a 76. George Bush's average, while he was in the same college, Yale, was 77. When he heard that, Bush said, 'You mean, he's the dumb one?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The records show as a freshman John Kerry had four Ds, and I know the feeling. Honestly, I think if my grades had been higher, I might have gotten the 'Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled against the use of medical marijuana. Of course, this came as a big shock to marijuana advocates who showed up to argue the case today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a big speech at a fundraiser the other night, Hillary Clinton said, 'I stay awake at night thinking of all and bad decisions being made in Washington.' She stays awake at night. Of course, she's up anyway waiting for Bill to get home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's book, 'My Life,' came out in paperback. And it's got a lot of new material that wasn't in the original. Look, see. 'Ten New Chicks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been revealed that John Kerry's grades -- everybody thought he was the smart one. When he and Bush went to Yale together, his grades were lower than President Bush. He had a lower grade point average than Bush. That's like losing a spelling bee to Jessica Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up at the Canadian border -- did you hear about this? This crazed man, a crazed guy crosses into Maine, carrying a homemade sword, a hatchet, a knife, brass knuckles, and a chainsaw stained with blood. It was Howard Dean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They let this guy into the country. He had all those weapons, plus his chainsaw with blood on it. But they did confiscate his nail clippers. So, that was good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark Felt announced he was Deep Throat. That was a stunning revelation. Then earlier today, the same guy announced that back in the '70s, he was Big Foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In about a month, the trial of Saddam Hussein will begin over in Iraq. In about a month he goes on trial. We have a list now. The witnesses for the defense include Chemical Ali, Tariq Aziz and Macauley Culkin. Odd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the charges against Saddam Hussein, here's what they are. Attacking Iran is one of the charges. Invading Kuwait. But the good news, the lawyers were able to get them to drop the shoplifting charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry's &quot;grade average at Yale, 76. George Bush also attended Yale. His grade average, 77. I thought 77 was pretty good considering Bush never showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of presidents, coincidently, President Clinton also had low marks on his thighs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Ways George W. Bush Can Regain His Popularity: 10. Dip into Social Security to give every American free HBO. 9. Use diplomacy to bring peace to Brad, Jen and Angelina. 8. Try fixing Iraq, creating some jobs, reducing the deficit and maybe capturing Osama. 7. Figure out a way for the Yankees to win a game. 6. Replace his 'country simpleton' persona with more lovable 'hillbilly idiot' image. 5. Use weekly radio address to give Americans a Van Halen twofer. 4. Get Saddam to switch to boxers. 3. Ditch the librarian and make Eva Longoria First Lady. 2. Resign. 1. Jump on Oprah's couch while professing his love for Katie Holmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a press conference yesterday, President Bush said -- this is interesting. He said he's learned a lot about what it's like to live in Africa from U2's Bono. That's what he said, yeah. The President also said he's learned a lot about what it's like to live underwater from Spongebob.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Trade Bank of Iraq issued the country's first ever credit card, an Iraqi credit card. And now, thanks to us, the Iraqi people are free to borrow money at 30% interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, they're getting ready to put Saddam Hussein on trial. Saddam Hussein is going on trial. I didn't know he liked little boys.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw on the news, today, it is 113 degrees in New Delhi, India. 113 degrees. Now, you feel a little better that the person who stole your job last year, at least now he's sweating his ass off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You heard all the grumbling and complaints out of Guantanamo where they have the al Qaeda detainees; they say they are being mistreated, subjected to mild noninjurious physical contact. Let's go through that again, mild, noninjurious physical contact. I mean it's like going six rounds with Mike Tyson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you see what people did? Did you see this on the news? I'm not making this up. They went down to the beach to wait for it. You get the impression these people don't quite understand the meaning of the word 'tsunami'?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration [is] now resisting calls to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay. They said while it's true many prisoners there have not been charged with a specific crime, they are sure each of them has done something bad that deserves punishment. Now, you could say the same thing about half the people who work at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried that. We couldn't get him to go to Alabama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House spokesman Scott McClellan said it would be hard to create an artificial timetable for getting out of Iraq. You think that's true? We went in for artificial reasons, using artificial intelligence. Why not have an artificial timetable to get out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The founder of Adelphia Cable, John Rigas I think his name is, was sentenced for 15 years in prison for looting the cable company and lying about his finances. That means his wife will now have to wait 15 years for the cable guy to come out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton on the news the other day, talking about his health. He said that after his heart surgery, he tries to walk for an hour a day faithfully. He says the walking part is easy, but staying faithful for an hour -- a whole hour! He gets up to like 48 minutes, 'Oh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York papers are having a field day with this. They're reporting that Clinton is allegedly having an affair with a woman who lives in his town.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're getting closer and closer to the trial for Saddam Hussein, and according to his prison guards hanging around Saddam Hussein, they say now that he is hooked on Cheetos and Doritos.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to The Tonight Show. Thank you. Thank you. What a crowd. You sound like the Saudi royal family when they heard oil hit $60 a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; $60 a barrel, that's an all-new high. In fact the price of oil is so high, today President Bush called that Saudi prince -- remember the one he was holding hands with last month? -- And said, 'How about dinner and a movie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I like President Bush. I just don't think he understands this problem. Like today when they asked him what effect prices would have on the average car owner he said, 'Well, not much, because most Americans buy their oil in little cans. They don't buy the big barrels.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to an interview in 'GQ' magazine, Saddam Hussein says he wishes to be friends with President Bush. Isn't that ironic? The one foreign leader who reaches out to President Bush and it's Saddam Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the same 'GQ' article, Saddam Hussein says he is 100% certain he will one day return to power. You know, kind of like the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former president Clinton said yesterday that the prison in Guantanamo Bay should be cleaned up or closed down. You know, there's a time when the people were saying the same thing about the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush welcomed Vietnam's Prime Minister to the White House today. He promised the Prime Minister he will travel to Vietnam next year. Unless, of course, his dad can get him out of it again. But he will try.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to USA Today, even though the number of American students studying abroad has gone up, the number of American students studying in Muslim countries is still very low. Gee, I wonder why that is. What American kid wouldn't jump at a chance to get a full scholarship to the University of Fallujah?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The founder of Adelphia Cable, John Rigas, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for looting the cable company. Isn't that amazing. Even cable companies steal from cable companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out the jury was made up of 12 people who had satellite dishes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's another way you can tell that it's summer. Saddam Hussein has switched to Cool Ranch Doritos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently while he's in prison Saddam Hussein says it that he loves Doritos. I'm telling you, you can't buy publicity like that, can you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean honestly, if you have a snack food company, you want that endorsement from the Butcher of Baghdad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But apparently they say that Saddam Hussein got hooked on Doritos at Chemical Ali's Super Bowl party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, Saddam Hussein told his guards...that he doesn't like George W. Bush and that he misses Ronald Reagan. Well, good news, Saddam, you'll be seeing him soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the soldiers who are guarding Saddam Hussein, Saddam likes having Raisin Bran for breakfast, but hates Fruit Loops. Hates Fruit Loops, yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, President Bush said, 'He hates Fruit Loops? He's more evil than I thought.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush said he will visit Vietnam next year. You know, we like President Bush, I just don't think he understands.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Turns out he's a neat freak who likes to eat Doritos and Cheetos all day. At least, that's what he said on his profile in Eharmony.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Air Force has now officially called off the search for a missing nuclear bomb that was sunk off the coast of Savannah, Georgia, in 1958.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new book out about Hillary Clinton that claims Bill is still having affairs but that Hillary continues to look the other way. Only problem is, when Hillary does look the other way, Bill's having sex with a woman over there, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have been criticizing the media lately for focusing so much on all these sensational missing persons cases, you know? And the critics are saying the media only covers the missing persons cases if the people are young and attractive. I mean, think about it. It's probably true. You know, I think they're right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the accounts of Saddam Hussein in prison, the prison guards talking about the guy? Saddam Hussein apparently addicted to Doritos.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam's even been giving his prison guards advice on dating women. He told them, what you do is play some Barry White in your spider hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Reasons Saddam Hussein Loves Doritos: 10. Three-cornered chips remind him of the Sunni Triangle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Chemical Ali told him how to convert the spicy powder into a nerve agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The 'crunch' sounds like the breaking of a dissident's bones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush announced that he has decided to visit Vietnam. He's going to visit Vietnam. The President said, 'It must be a pretty nice place. I hear John McCain spent five years there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was so hot, &quot;I was sweating like Senator Dick Durbin at an American Legion convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, American flags were bursting into flames all by themselves.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The House of Representatives has voted to approve a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. Which is surprising, because up to this, you know, in the past, Congress always rejected flag burning amendments because Congress felt that any form of speech, no matter how vile or insulting, should be permitted. See, they believed that because that's how they campaigned and got elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week the Prime Minister of Vietnam met with President Bush in the Oval Office. Again, you know, we like President Bush. I don't think he understands these issues. When he met the Prime Minister of Vietnam, 'He said are you from the good Vietnam or the bad Vietnam?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Army announced this week they are now training mine-sniffing dogs to go to Iraq. Mine-sniffing dogs. Boy, how bad do you have to screw up at obedience school to get that job?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, one of the biggest problems in Iraq right now is agreeing on a constitution, coming up with a constitution. See, they should do what Washington does -- have a constitution, you just don't use it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To sum up the interview&quot; with Katie Couric, runaway bride Jennifer Wilbanks &quot;said she decided to act on impulse, she had no idea where she was going, what to do when she got there, even how to get home. Kind of like President Bush in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today, President Bush said that his economic plan would help Americans from all walks of life. Bush said, 'My plan will help you whether you're a billionaire or just a millionaire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a crowd! Welcome to the Tonight Show. Man, you sound like Saddam Hussein when he got another bag of Doritos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I've never discussed this but during the Vietnam war, I was in the ROTC program. Did you know that? I was in ROTC, which, of course, stood for 'Running Off To Canada.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for those of you&quot; members of the military in the audience &quot;going to Iraq, remember, you are Americans, so don't take any Shiite! Remember that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, of course, you're only here for 60 minutes, but then Rumsfeld could extend that. So I don't know how that works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, see, the folks at home might not know this, but you know -- and this is by law -- do you know by law, they are not allowed to make fun of their Commander in Chief? That's why I'm here. That's my job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, they're not even here to see the show. It's just that Bush has closed down so many military bases, these people have no place else to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is being reported over 500 female soldiers have gotten free breast implants while in the service. And that's while Bush was President. Imagine how many there were under Clinton!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else happened this week? Oil, $60 a barrel. It's $60 a barrel. In fact, today, President Bush declared war on Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unbelievable, $60 a barrel. Although, Costco has it for $49, but you have to buy the whole tanker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has just got people up in arms, the Supreme Court ruled today that the government has the right to seize your land. They can take your land. And today, Native Americans said, 'What else is new? Oh, what a surprise! Oh, wow, welcome to the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let me tell you something. This is particularly scary in the red states, 'cause there, they can tow your house away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Federal judge has ruled that Amtrak can charge disabled people, in wheelchairs, more money to ride the train. Is that unbelievable? They have to pay extra if they are disabled. And chances are it was an Amtrak crash that caused them to be disabled in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry the cable guy is here. You know Larry's catch phrase, 'Git-r-done.' 'Git-r-done.' Which is also, I think, Bill Clinton's catch phrase&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting some insight into Saddam Hussein, now that he's been incarcerated for over a year, I guess it is. The guards looking after Saddam Hussein says he sits around all day in his underwear eating Doritos, and in this country, of course, we call that college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saddam is also a clean freak. He's a clean freak. That's what ended his relationship with Ava Gardner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? This is a little frightening. According to confidential reports, Al Qaeda was planning an attack on Las Vegas. And it happened after Osama bin Laden paid $200 to see Celine Dion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite protests from conservatives this week, President Bush appointed an openly gay man as his assistant secretary of commerce. Yeah. Everyone's talking about it. Yeah, Bush claimed that the gay man is perfect for the Commerce Department because, 'Those people love to shop.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made the news. He testified before Congress, and Ted Kennedy called for Rumsfeld's resignation. Asked him to resign, yeah. Yeah, this is interesting. This marks the first time Kennedy has ever come out against anything with 'rum' in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks earlier tonight saw President Bush's address on television? I was surprised, because apparently, the war in Iraq is going quite well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush highlighted his successes. The Iraqi election, that was a highlight. The improvement of homeland security, that was a big moment, and capturing Russell Crowe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush did admit that there are problems. The war is dragging on, of course. The economy is down. Gas prices are going up. And then, he left on his two-month vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush is doing anything he can to boost his popularity. As a matter of fact, tomorrow, he will be jumping up and down on Oprah's couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all have a nice happy Fourth of July? They had a huge fireworks show near my house last night. It was unbelievable. In fact, the explosions were so loud, I could barely hear the gunfire from the freeway.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one embarrassing moment at the White House yesterday at the Fourth of July celebration. Did you hear about this? I guess when they brought out the Declaration of Independence, President Bush kept looking for the treasure map on the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story, Sandra Day O'Connor announced she's retiring from the Supreme Court. She is 75 years old. That's got to be a drastic lifestyle change, you know. From sitting in the Supreme Court in a black robe all day to sitting in front of a TV in a flowered robe all day. Watching 'Judge Judy.' 'That bitch.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court continuing to rule on the separation of church and state. You know, they don't know what to do with this church and state stuff. You hear the latest ruling? They've banned the Ten Commandments from being inside the courthouse. You can't have them in the courthouse. But you can have them outside at a park. But you can't have them in. Inside, no. Outside, okay. So basically, God is like a smoker. 'Just take it outside. Hang around the front of the building. Just don't come inside.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said the Iranian presidential election was invalid. And the winner was no friend of democracy. To which Al Gore said, 'Hey, tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. Board members of the UN atomic watchdog agency, they approved a deal that exempts Saudi Arabia from any kind of nuclear inspection. Well, that makes sense. If you can't trust Saudi Arabia, who can you trust?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Convicted felons in the state of Ohio now have to give a sample of their DNA. You commit a crime in Ohio, you have to give your DNA. Now a man who pleads guilty to being a crack head says he will not give his DNA, because he thinks the state will try to clone him. Oh, yeah. If there's one thing we don't have enough of, it's crack heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law enforcement officials announced today they are now going to get tough with career criminals. Career criminals. What other kind of criminals are there? Are there people who do this just for a hobby?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new poll, 60% of doctors say they believe in some sort of afterlife. Here's the scary part -- HMO doctors will actually send you there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 36-year-old woman who is being charged with bigamy in Norway. ... She said she forgot she was already married. To which Bill Clinton said, 'Hey, it could happen. It could happen. It could happen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, 59 years old today. Happy birthday to President Bush. If you have not gotten him a gift yet, you know, you can't go wrong with an exit strategy for Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does a bicycle have in common with the war in Iraq? President Bush doesn't know how to stop either one of them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Scotland, President Bush, riding his bicycle when he collided with a police officer and fell off. No, I'm serious. Luckily, he was not injured. The ironic thing was Bush could have avoided the collision. But you know Bush, he refuses to go left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, personally, I blame the police officer. I mean, he should have heard Bush coming, with all those baseball cards in the spokes, you think he would have heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush visited Denmark, where he was greeted by the king and the queen. He thanked the Danes for their help in Iraq and he also told them, 'Hey, I love your great, big dogs, too. They're terrific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Olympic committee has picked where the 2012 Olympics will be held. The bad news, New York did not get it. The good news, the good news, neither did France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;London upset Paris today and was named the host of the 2012 summer Olympic Games. It was the English over the French, so basically, the toothless beat the spineless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bought a new robe on eBay yesterday, it used to belong to Sandra Day O'Connor, got a hell of a deal on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sandra Day O'Connor, Supreme Court judge, is stepping down. She didn't want to step down but she wants to make sure she's home so nobody can seize her house.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the government can seize a person's home and give it to a private developer if they think the city or town could make more money by giving your property to someone else. Like they could just take your property. This falls under the principle of one man's home is another man's Wal-Mart, apparently that's the way this works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A survey of law enforcement agencies says that methamphetamines are the number one drug problem in the country, surpassing marijuana. Well, you can see how meth dealers surpass marijuana dealers. Meth dealers are up all night, they don't sleep, they work harder, they work faster, 24 hours a day, they're hustling. The marijuana dealer, he sells some dope, watches cartoons for a while, kicks back, comes back an hour later, so you see why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's new prescription drug program will not cover drugs used to treat anxiety, which is great news for people suffering from anxiety!&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in Scotland for the G-8 summit, he's there for the G-8 summit, President Bush fell off his bike and had to be treated for scrapes on his hands and arms. Yeah, yeah. The White House physician said the President will be fine and should be back on his Big Wheel in no time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to tip one of those, too. He got caught in the colored streamers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The International Olympic Committee shocked everybody when they chose London to host the 2012 Olympics instead of the front-runner, Paris, France. Everyone thought it was going to be Paris, France, and they didn't go that way, yeah. The French say this is their most embarrassing defeat since every single war they've ever fought in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Sandra Day O'Connor is retiring from the Supreme Court. And a number of interest groups are trying to pressure President Bush's selection of a Supreme Court nominee. Some want Bush to nominate another woman, some want a man, some want an African American, some want a Caucasian. You know what that means? You know who the perfect nominee is? Michael Jackson!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of CBS News has commissioned his staff to come up with an evening news format that favors more of a story-telling style over the traditional news format. They want to go with story telling. Sounds like they're going to bring back Dan Rather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You know how&quot; Lance Armstrong &quot;goes to the bathroom while he's riding his bike? This is what he said.

And he feels awful about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Yesterday, the city of Paris lost the chance to host the 2012 Olympics. Apparently they are very bitter about it. Yeah, the Parisians are disappointed because they were looking forward to being rude to thousands of new people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Washington, DC, Vice President Dick Cheney went for his annual heart checkup with the doctors. Yeah. He doesn't go in personally. He just drops the heart off, picks it up later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House announcing next month Dick Cheney will get a colonoscopy. You know, it's important to get those on a regular basis. You need to get that. In fact, the last time he had one they found one polyp and three oil company executives up there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House also said that President Bush has begun his formal process of selecting his first nominee for the Supreme Court by reviewing key rulings. Now, we all like President Bush. Do you think he spends a lot of his free time reading a bunch of legal rulings? How many think President Bush's selection process falls into the area of 'eeny meeny miney moe?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has named former Senator Fred Thompson -- he stars on NBC's 'Law &amp; Order.' You know, the kind of gruff guy on 'Law &amp; Order.' He's going to oversee the selection process for the Supreme Court nominee. President Bush chose an actor. Yeah. He originally tried to get Screech from 'Saved by the Bell.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British people standing tough after yesterday. The terrible bombing. The Olympics will still go on. London buses are -- I think they're running today. So God bless them. See, the British people are very tough. They put up with the Nazis, they put up with Al Qaeda they even put up with Madonna. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a story this week in USA Today, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine says that terrorists will try to take advantage of our Coast Guard's aging fleet once they find out all our weaknesses. You know how they'll find out about our weaknesses? By reading our articles in USA Today!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people in Washington say that if our Coast Guard ships aren't replaced soon, they will be unable to keep drugs and illegal aliens from entering this country. Well, God forbid that should ever happen. Imagine what this place would be like if it was overrun with drugs and illegal aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor of Missouri has announced that his state will no longer pay for Viagra for poor and low-income people. You thought Branson was depressing before. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's what the Governor said. He will not pay for Viagra. So the Governor's doing to the poor people what they wanted to do with the Viagra apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House, the White House says President Bush is in no hurry to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and he might take four weeks to make a decision. Four weeks, yeah. Yeah, which makes sense because it took him three weeks to pick his favorite Teletubby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the International Olympic Committee voted to eliminate baseball from the summer Olympics. Gone, yeah. When asked why, officials said, 'We simply don't have enough steroids for both baseball and track and field to go around.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Vice President Dick Cheney had a medical checkup. He received an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram and a stress test. Yeah. In other words, he got what the doctors call the 'full Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton was also in Aspen, Colorado this week, where she gave a speech, and accused President Bush of damaging the economy by catering to the rich. Why give a speech in Aspen, Colorado, of course, unless you are catering to the rich?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it me, or does John Kerry look different? I was trying to -- I saw him yesterday giving this press conference. I was trying to figure out what it was. And then I saw an ad on cable. Take a look. These are the real pictures. Take a look at this.&quot; (Mock cable ad): &quot;Here's John Kerry on November 11th, 2003. And here he is on July 12th, 2005. How do you explain this? It's the botox, baby!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, the space shuttle launch scheduled today was canceled. Apparently, couldn't afford to fill the tank with gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey, 32% of Americans believe in ghosts. ... Here's the interesting part. Liberals are twice as likely as conservatives to believe in ghosts. 42% to 25%. See, that's why liberals are against the death penalty. They think that the guy might get pissed off, come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House today says President Bush is standing by his top adviser, Karl Rove, even though Rove apparently revealed the identity of a CIA agent. Yeah. However, the President says he will fire Rove if he reveals the ending to 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former head of WorldCom, Bernie Ebbers sentenced to 25 years in prison yesterday. Yes! Suddenly, we've got powerful, smug white people going to jail. This is not good news for Karl Rove, I'll tell you that right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there are hints now that President Bush might be backing away from Karl Rove. Like today, he gave him a new job -- ambassador to Iraq. That's not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole Karl Rove scandal, you know about this, right? It's just like the Clinton scandal. It involves a pudgy person in the Oval Office who can't keep their mouth shut. It's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In testimony on Capitol Hill, the Pentagon admitted to degrading and abusing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. They said one prisoner was forced to wear a bra, dance with another man, wear a leash and perform dog tricks. The bad news, they did not get any information from the guy. The good news, the guy has now been accepted at five different fraternities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a Cabinet meeting this week, President Bush said he would be willing to consider people who are not judges or lawyers for the next Supreme Court opening. Yeah. Making the supreme laws of the land, what kind of job is that for professionals, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nice to know the Supreme Court has the same job requirement as working at McDonald's, basically. 'Oh, no, you'll learn when you get there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news is Chief Justice William Rehnquist has left the hospital. He left the hospital. Doctors described his condition as 'stable and leaning to the far right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, here's the latest, President Bush was asked if he would consider nominating someone to the Supreme Court who has never been a judge before, and he said, 'You bet.' He said, 'You bet.' Yeah. Then the President said the same thing when someone asked if he wanted to take the day off and play laser tag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went to Indiana today. Indiana, to try to reach out to the state's black voters. That's right. Apparently, Indiana's black voters are divided. One likes Bush, but the other doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, former President Clinton played golf with Yankee manager Joe Torre. They play golf together. Yeah. Apparently, they spent most of the time trying to figure out who's a bigger pain in the ass, Hillary or George Steinbrenner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, I finally saw the movie 'Batman Begins.' It's pretty good. 'Batman begins.' I made the mistake. I went to see it with Karl Rove. Through the whole movie he kept whispering, 'Batman's really Bruce Wayne.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, it's a huge scandal in Washington about Deputy Chief of Staff, Karl Rove. He's in a lot of trouble for allegedly leaking the name of a CIA operative to the New York Times. Remember the good old days, the only thing leaking in the White House was President Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, this puts President Bush in kind of a jam, because a year ago he said that whoever leaked the identity of the CIA operative would be fired, see. It's a case of Bush spoke too soon. Like when he said 'mission accomplished.' You know, same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, actually, Karl Rove did not seem worried about this, 'cause he knows that George Bush is extremely loyal to his staff. He's a very loyal guy. Bush never wants to fire any of them. Not out of loyalty, he just hates having to learn new names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WorldCom CEO, Bernie Ebbers, sentenced to 25 years in prison this week. There you go. ... No, for defrauding people out of almost $11 billion. Isn't that amazing? Did you see this? I tell you something, this sends an important message. Being rich isn't enough to get you off in America anymore. Now you have to be a celebrity, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, WorldCom, which is in the telecommunications business, they're now offering a Bernie Ebbers special -- half off all your long distance calls from prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon admitted this week that during one interrogation at Guantanamo Bay, they forced a prisoner, oh, who admits to being the 20th hijacker, by the way, they made him wear a bra and dance with another man. Is that really torture?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay, you're holding a guy captive and saying, 'Look, you either tell us what we want to know, or I'm going so put you in this bra and maybe we'll dance.' 'Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know, since that happened, forcing the guy to wear a bra and dance with another guy, they now talk of opening a Guantanamo Bay in West Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Support for Osama bin Laden is falling in Muslim countries. His poll numbers are down among Muslims. Now in all fairness, his last couple of videos really did suck, you've got to admit that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, bin Laden's approval rating is so low, today he hired Karl Rove to try to get the numbers back up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas continues to go through the roof. Oh, my God, it was $2.87 across the street here. See, this is especially tough on people here in Los Angeles. People spend so much money on gas, they don't have enough money left for ammunition, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as for spending time in the hospital, today Chief Rehnquist of the Supreme Court denied, denied reports that he's retiring. He's not retiring. He says that was a nasty rumor started by his mortician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study by National geographic...11% of Americans between the age of 18 and 24 could not find the United States on a map of the world. Isn't that pathetic? You know the only place where everyone could find the United States on a map? Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush commented on this today. He said, 'Why do our kids need to find the US on a map? They're already here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's also a report that Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is now being urged not to retire. Yeah. In fact, Clarence Thomas told her, 'Please don't go. You're so much hotter than Ruth Bader Ginsburg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It was so hot, interrogators at Guantanamo Bay were letting the inmates go braless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;I was listening to President Bush's radio address over the weekend, where he was talking about picking the new Supreme Court justice. I must say, I'm no expert here -- I'm a little worried about his selection process. Did you hear it? Listen to the speech.&quot; &quot;President Bush&quot;: &quot;Our nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice that Americans can be proud of. So the next Supreme Court nominee will be the tenth caller. The lines are open. Call now. Good luck!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Chief Justice William Rehnquist has denied reports he's going to retire for health reasons. He said that during an interview on the TV show 'Crossing Over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The Prime Minister of India was at the White House today. One kind of embarrassing moment when President Bush said to the Prime Minister, 'Could you take a look at my computer? I'm having some problems.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Hey, I thought this was a lovely gesture -- earlier today, Martha Stewart showed Karl Rove how to slip off the electronic ankle monitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;First, President Bush said he would fire anyone who leaked the name of the CIA agent. Then, when he found out it was Karl Rove, he said he would fire anyone who committed a crime. Today he's changing it to -- he'd fire anyone who gets more than a ten-year sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney went to the George Washington University hospital, and got a colonoscopy. Doctor said his colon is fine, but his esophagus is enflamed. Let me tell you something, if you finish a colonoscopy, and you have a sore throat, that is a very thorough exam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for an investigation of the video game, 'Grand Theft Auto.' Well, do you think she's running for president? 'We must stop these video games.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;No, she says there is hidden sex in the game. I don't know. Is Hillary really the best one to go looking for hidden sex?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;A Middle Eastern man lost his job as a baggage screener at the Houston airport after airport officials found out he was a rapper named 'The Arabic Assassin.' And in his music he praised the 9/11 hijackers. In his music. The guy works there for six months, the airport had no idea he was a potential threat. Really, wouldn't the name 'The Arabic Assassin' perhaps be enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Two out of every ten men and four out of every ten men here in America of recruiting age in the military are too fat. They are too fat to get into the military. How embarrassing is that? When you can't get your ass in a humvee, okay, that is a bad sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;The LA Dodgers are not looking good. Lost again the other night. Oh, man. In fact, they're doing so poorly, Congress is now saying steroids will be mandatory for all Dodger games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;According to new statistics, methamphetamines are now the most popular street drugs in America, which is very upsetting to me because last month, my broker had me invest everything in crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Sen. John McCain is &quot;in the movie 'Wedding Crashers.' He's in that movie. And, if you haven't seen the movie yet, believe me, the Senator's nude scene's very tastefully done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Actually, it's just a cameo in the movie. It's just a token appearance. You know, kind of like President Bush in the National Guard. It's a very small, small part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;There are a couple of funny little, real short topless scenes with women in this movie, and a lot of people are saying, why would McCain do a movie with topless women? Maybe he's reaching out to Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;It is so hot today that Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove leaked the names Ben and Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Karl Rove, he is desperate now, he's trying to improve his image and this afternoon he was jumping up and down on Oprah's couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;So Saddam Hussein now looks like he's getting ready to go on trial. And the United States is confused. We can't decide whether to charge him, put him in court and try him, send him to jail or just put him back in charge and get the hell out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had his annual physical over the weekend, and doctors gave him a clean bill of health. Clean bill of health to Dick Cheney, and they say there's no reason he can't live to have four or five more heart attacks, honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Cheney has one little minor thing, he's suffering from irritation of the esophagus and swollen arteries in his knees. Yeah. In Washington that's known as the Lewinsky Syndrome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were standing next to President Bush just to get all the breeze from his backpedaling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this evening, President Bush nominated a new Supreme Court justice. He was gonna make the announcement over the weekend, but with the Harry Potter book and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he just didn't have the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new Harry Potter book, the fastest selling book in history. Isn't that amazing? And you know what's unbelievable about this? Not one person knew the plot of the book in advance. 100 million copies, not one person knew. What's that say about our country when Barnes &amp; Noble is better at keeping a secret than the White House?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Karl Rove is starting to get a little worried. I think he's starting to run a little scared. Did you see him today? Like today he said the biggest problem facing Americans? 'Prison rape.' Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had his annual checkup this week. And doctors, they did a review of Cheney's pacemaker, and they said it never had to go off. You know how those work? It's designed to automatically stabilize Cheney's heartbeat if it begins to beat erratically, or if the price of oil goes below $40 a barrel.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was at the White House, where he met with the Prime Minister of Australia. President Bush says he's always liked Australia, since he found out that's where Arnold Schwarzenegger is from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;20% of the men and 40% of the women of recruiting age in this country would be turned down for military service because they are too fat. Isn't that unbelievable? Do you realize that if they ever reinstated the draft, to avoid it, people wouldn't have to go to Canada, just go to McDonald's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Diego's acting Mayor, a guy named Michael Zucchet. ... He's only been in office one day. One day! And he was convicted by a Federal grand jury of taking payoffs from a local strip club owner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and here's the creepy part. The money was stuffed in his pants $1 at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the fourth mayor in three days in San Diego. Yeah, the first guy, some kind of problem, this guy, then an acting one, and then they quit. There's more security in being president of Iraq than there is being mayor of San Diego.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's talk now about changing California's three strikes and you're out law. Do you know about this? They wants to change the three strikes and you're out -- you know who wants to change it? The Dodgers. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a very strange fact. Did you know that 85% of American women wear the wrong size bra? More than eight out of ten women are wearing the wrong size bra. You know, it's amazing what you can learn from reading those Bill Clinton memoirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks following the scandal with Karl Rove? Earlier today, President Bush says that he doesn't want to act too quickly. And does not want to act before he has all of the facts. And I was thinking, 'Jeez, this doesn't sound like the President Bush I know.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush said that he will stand by Karl Rove. And you know what that means, he will be gone in a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush announced his nominee for the Supreme Court and get this, it was expected to be a woman from New Orleans. ... Yeah, which is surprising because experts say if he wanted a Southerner who sits around in a robe all day he should have picked Kevin Federline.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all feel the ground shake last night? Did you feel it? Huh? It wasn't the earthquake. It was the Supreme Court shifting another five feet to the right.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, President Bush picked Judge John Roberts to be his nominee for the Supreme Court. The name was actually leaked to the press a couple hours earlier. Boy, that Karl Rove is unbelievable, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the job of Supreme Court extremely important. 'Cause as you know, these are the people we choose to pick the next president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Roberts is &quot;only 50 years old. He could serve on the court for the next 40 years. You know what that means? He could still be there when we finally pull out of Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the Democrats are saying that while Roberts is extremely conservative, he is very bright, he is intellectually curious and has a great legal mind. So it must have been a real thrill for him to be interviewed by President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, President Bush had a state dinner for the Prime Minister of India. Did you see them together? Kind of an odd couple. First time I think the White House had a cowboy and an Indian in the same room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, the only ex-president who hasn't planned his own funeral is Bill Clinton. I think Hillary has planned it 1,000 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore announced he's starting his own TV cable network. Good. Get in on the ground floor, Al. No, he's starting his cable network. He's billing it as the first network for 18 to 34-year-olds. Apparently, Al's never heard of MTV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you all know about most car companies giving us these employee discounts. You've seen these ads, 'You pay what we pay.' That's the big thing now, employee discounts. How about the gas companies giving us the Saudi royal family discount? That would be a cool one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the trial of Saddam Hussein is beginning. They say the evidence against Hussein is so strong, even a California jury might convict him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know it was ride your motorcycle to work day? Yeah, don't confuse it with Bill Clinton's favorite day -- that's ride your hog-at-work day. That's a whole different...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is so hot in Washington, DC, that &quot;earlier today, the statue of Lincoln was actually sitting in the reflecting pool, so it's just that hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess we're all excited that President Bush announced his nomination to the Supreme Court, John Roberts. That's right. Bush searched far and wide before he made the risky choice of a white guy in his 50s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what we know about John Roberts. He is a conservative. And as a small town judge, he once outlawed dirty dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced that he has nominated Judge John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Yeah. And when asked why, Bush said he picked Roberts because he has 'one of the finest legal minds since Matlock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, speaking of the president, hosted a state dinner for the Prime Minister of India. Big state dinner, yeah. Yeah, and there was an awkward moment when Bush urged the Indian Prime Minister to clean his plate because there are people starving in his country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, good crowd. You sound like Karl Rove when he realized the Supreme Court nomination knocked him right off the front page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has nominated John Roberts to be the next Supreme Court justice. So counting this nomination, this is the second person to get a job for life from President Bush. The first, of course, being the guy in charge of the war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new government report, China's increasingly modern military will eventually threaten the United States. They already have these intercontinental missiles that can reach us. Do you think we have anything to worry about from China? Why would they try to kill their best customer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's like Columbia trying to destroy Hollywood. You know, it doesn't make any sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Bill Clinton is the only ex-president who has not planned his own funeral. Which is pretty amazing considering, you know, he recently had that near-death experience. Not the heart bypass. You know, when Hillary came home early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A bill was recently introduced in Congress that required 10 million illegal aliens to leave the country. Now, opponents of the bill say these immigrants are important to our economy because they only take the jobs Americans don't want. Which is true. See, they can't take the jobs we want. Those jobs are already in India.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jude Law has broken up with his fianc?e because he was sleeping with the family nanny. You know how his fianc?e found out about it? Anybody know? Karl Rove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Attorney General Janet Reno is 67 years old today. 67 years old today. And if you're thinking about giving her a gift, you can't go wrong with a medicine ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about President Bush's appointment to the Supreme Court, John Roberts? John Roberts. Could be the newest member of the Supreme Court. And I'm telling you, I haven't seen this much charisma since the Oreck vacuum guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's everywhere now. He is doing a lot of interviews, hoping to get nominated. Earlier today he was jumping up and down on Oprah's couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parent across the country are furious because the video game 'Grand Theft Auto' contains hidden sex scenes. ... Yeah, the parents say, 'We bought our kids Grand Theft Auto so they could be exposed to violent car jackings, not sex.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big story yesterday, Canada joined Spain by becoming one of the only countries to legalize gay marriage. True. Yeah. As a result, Canada and Spain are going to spend the weekend antiquing in Vermont.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, the US military wants to disperse angry rioters by using a new weapon called a microwave beam. A microwave beam they've invented, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House revealed today that there were 11 finalists for the Supreme Court nomination before President Bush chose this John Roberts guy. Here's the shocking part. You know hot runner-up was? Anybody know? Bo Bice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are now reports that top White House aide Karl Rove is being investigated for lying to the grand jury. You know, that sounds like a rich white guy crime, doesn't it? Lying to the grand jury. You never see anybody on 'Cops' charged with that. 'Clem, put your shirt on, you've been charged with lying to the grand jury.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney got a colonoscopy this week and the doctors say he's fine but they discovered he has an inflamed esophagus. Well. Which is kind of strange. I mean, you go in for a colonoscopy, and you come out -- you've got an inflamed -- you know what I'm saying? I guess it's better than the other way around, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they increased security measures along the -- you know Los Angeles subway system? They increased security there. Today, they searched both people who were riding. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pennsylvania Republican family values Congressman Don Sherwood who's married, the guy's married has admitted he had an affair for five years with a young woman. But he said it was a five-year affair he deeply regrets. How come these guys only regret the affair after they got caught?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he got elected to Congress, he was a used car dealer. So, he's married, a Congressman, and a used car dealer -- that's like the trifecta of lying right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The video game industry has changed the ratings of the game 'Grand Theft Auto' to adults only after pressure from media watchdog groups and politicians because the game had hidden sexual content. Politicians felt the game, the sex rather, would have a negative effect on the children. Yeah. That shows you how uptight we are in this country about sex. Apparently a game where you're stealing cars and killing cops is okay. It's just the sex we're worried about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Bill Clinton is the only ex-president who hasn't planned his own funeral. But in his defense, President Clinton did say in the past, he wants to be buried next to Hillary. I guess he figured they never slept together when they were alive, might as well try it now that we're dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Gates made a speech earlier this week where he said he is surprised that more people aren't becoming computer programmers. Maybe that's because they don't want to move to India.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you can certainly tell that it's summer, can't you. Today's terror alert color is watermelon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday today to a great American. Bob Dole 84 years old today. Happy birthday. The Army Corps of Engineers conducted a controlled burn on his cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush had breakfast with his Supreme Court nominee, John Roberts. The two of them got together and had breakfast, yeah. Afterwards, Bush said he's never seen a better qualified candidate, while Roberts said he's never seen a grown man eat Count Chocula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq, this is the latest -- American helicopters are dropping teddy bears with tiny parachutes attached in order to improve relations with Iraqi children. ...

In my home town of Boston, they've been digging this tunnel for 30 years. It's still not finished, it cost more than -- and those guys were high when they were building it! Idiots!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the launch was successful. Although you probably saw, they did notice something fly off the side of the shuttle during liftoff. Did you see that? Yeah, something flew off. Turns out it was a couple of really lost Cubans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post reporting today that three years ago, Osama bin Laden tried to buy massive amounts of cocaine in order to poison it, and then sell it here in America.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say the Colombian drug lord that Osama approached decided against it. They didn't want to do it. See, that's pretty bad, when we have to rely on the kindness of Colombian drug lords.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Osama bin Laden had a plan in 2002 to kill thousands of Americans by buying huge amounts of cocaine, spiking it with poison, and then reselling it in America. And then he changed his mind. He came up with a simpler plan -- he bought a bunch of stock in R.J. Reynolds.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, that was bin Laden's plan, to kill people here with cocaine. Well, that would be horrible. What would we do if we lost all our cokeheads? Oh, we'd be lost.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And let me tell Osama bin Laden something, okay? Putting poison in our drugs is not going to stop people in this country. In Hollywood, they inject poison right into their faces, okay, to get rid of wrinkles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has changed their slogan from 'the war on terror,' remember they were calling it 'the war on terror?' That's out. They've now changed it to 'the global struggle against violent extremism.' Well, that just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that a good idea, giving President Bush more syllables to pronounce?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House instituted a new don't ask, don't tell policy. The bad news it is for the Supreme Court nominees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced...that the public, the public would not be allowed to see the memos produced by Supreme Court nominee John Roberts when he represented the United States government as a lawyer. They say this is because of the attorney-client privilege. Here's the part I don't understand -- he was representing the United States. We're the clients. He's our lawyer. Shouldn't we be allowed to see our own notes? Am I wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there are now rumors that the controversial White House aide, Karl Rove, may have a girlfriend on the side. Well, let's hope nobody leaks her name, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Washington think tank has concluded that the job of finding and removing all the illegal immigrants from the United States would cost $200 billion and take over five years. Unless we hired illegal immigrants. That would cost us a tenth of the price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The husband of Judith Miller, do you know who she is? She's a New York Times reporter. Remember the woman who went to jail on principle rather than reveal her sources? And she's still in jail. To protect her sources, she went to jail. They announced today her husband is on an expensive Mediterranean cruise. She's been in jail three weeks, he's on a cruise. Well, you can't expect a man to wait forever, come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see John Kerry over there in France? He was over there to meet with Lance Armstrong after his victory. I don't know why. Actually, you know why? Do you know this? John Kerry, at one point, wanted to be a professional bicycle racer, but he could never find a helmet to fit over his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wal-Mart says they plan to open over 90 stores in China. One will be a superstore called the Great Wal-Mart of China.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New reports says that in 2002 Osama bin Laden tried to buy thousands of pounds of cocaine, poison it, and then sell it here in America. Tainted cocaine. As opposed to the normal healthy cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been rumors this week that Bush's top aide, Karl Rove, may have a girlfriend on the side. Yeah. See, that never would have happened with the previous president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, sure, there were plenty of slutty women who were willing to carry on cheap affairs with White House staffers, but they could never get past Bill Clinton. See what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope said earlier this week that churches in countries like the United States are dying out. He said, 'It's like they're going out of business.' Do you know why? See, people used to need the churches to help us understand the word of God. But, now that job, of course, has been transferred to the Federal Government. Now they tell us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush had his annual physical, good news, he's in amazing shape. Incredible shape. They said his heartbeat at rest is down from 52 beats a minute to 47 beats per minute. Which is pretty impressive when you realize a lot of times Dick Cheney has no heartbeat at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors did caution President Bush about his posture. His posture. You notice when he stands he tends to lean way to the right. They noticed that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also got his energy bill passed last week. It includes his new logging program, no tree left behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Trump told Congress he could renovate the UN cheaper and quicker than the current bids they have. Of course, they'd have to change the name.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to President Bush's most recent physical, he is the most physically fit president in American history. It's pretty amazing. He's in the 99th percentile for men 55 to 59, which works out perfect, because Dick Cheney's in the 1% percentile.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctor said President Bush's only bad habit is that he smokes an occasional cigar. And today, Bush said he only smokes cigars to help him think. So luckily, he's not smoking that often.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush appointed John Bolton as the new Ambassador to the United Nations. He did it while the Senate was in recess. You see, this is interesting. Democrats say President Bush circumvented the system to get his way. And Bush said that's completely ridiculous. He said, 'I never circumvented anything.' In fact, he said, 'I'm not even Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new government study, the country is not prepared for a biological attack. The study said that after four years, we are still ill prepared to deal with deadly viruses and germs, which is comforting after I just shook everybody's hands. So I feel better about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not prepared for biological attack, really? We weren't even prepared for the flu.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I do to prepare for biological attacks? I try to eat a hot dog every day. It builds up my immunity to biological weapons, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rafael Palmeiro, suspended for violating baseball's steroid policy. At the congressional hearings in Washington, categorically denied -- denied that he ever used steroids. Kind of makes you miss the straightforward honesty of Pete Rose, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's great? A little more than an hour after the suspension, President Bush came forward and defended him. How does that make Karl Rove feel, huh? I mean, it took Bush a month to say anything about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush says he believes Rafael when he says he didn't take steroids, even though he tested positive for them. He believes him, even though the guy failed the test. You know, that whole weapons of mass destruction thing is starting to make sense now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palmeiro was furious after the test. He was really upset. He said, hey, I paid good money for that urine. You know, and he was really mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Help me out with something here. I've been thinking about this all day: Do you think it's too soon to hit on Queen Fahd?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about John Bolton, the new US Ambassador to the UN. Colleagues say he's arrogant. They say he's caustic. They say he's blunt. They say he's constantly browbeating underlings. They...wait a minute, that's me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on a three-week vacation down in Crawford, Texas, and it's what they call a working vacation...&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the staff says it's an important time for President Bush. This gives him time to kick back, and I'm thinking, 'When the hell does this guy kick forward?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Baltimore slugger Rafael Palmeiro tested positive for steroids, a few months after telling Congress, 'I never took steroids, period.' Yeah, then today, today, Palmeiro said, 'I meant to say I never took steroids, question mark.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said that even though&quot; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro &quot;apparently lied to Congress about taking steroids, he's a friend and he's standing by him. Yeah. In fact, when Karl Rove heard this, he started wolfing down steroids.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that rumor persists in Washington that Karl Rove has a girlfriend on the side, but he will not comment on her. So you know what that means. Apparently, she does not work for the CIA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The energy bill passed Congress this week. Surprise, surprise. It has huge tax breaks for energy companies and oil companies. What a shock. They said it was an historic bill. They said this was the first time a pork barrel was ever placed inside an oil barrel.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had his yearly physical. They're saying President Bush is the fittest president in history because he spends a lot of his time exercising. See, previous presidents wasted that time reading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview with reporters, President Bush said schools should teach kids the theory of intelligent design. ... Intelligent design, which says the creation of life is way too complex to be understood by science and we should leave those questions to God. Of course, President Bush also felt the same way about algebra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is taking his summer vacation. It's a five-week vacation. He has taken his 50th vacation in the last five years, 50th vacation. That's about the national average, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But while he's on vacation, he will continue to receive national security briefings. He will receive them, of course he won't read them. But he will receive them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's vacationing in Crawford, Texas. He will be there for five weeks. That's really a long time. You know, I don't think Bush has an exit strategy for his vacation either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush left for an extended vacation. President Bush is planning to relax and take it easy at his ranch for five weeks. Which is why President Bush's new Secret Service codename is 'Kevin Federline.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that an anti-Hillary Clinton Website has only been able to raise $12,000. That's it. Yeah. When asked why, Bill Clinton said, 'That's all I had.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And al Jazeera television today aired a videotape by a man considered to be al Qaeda's number two man. I guess that means he carries the toilet paper. Is that what that means?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's really depressing? That new al Qaeda video actually beat NBC in the ratings last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people are wondering why it was this Zawahiri guy, the number 2 guy, was on the tape and not bin Laden. Turns out bin Laden takes the entire month of August off just like Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people, very critical of President Bush for taking the entire month of August off for this vacation. But his staff points out there's nothing at the White House he can't do at the ranch. Because the ranch is fully equipped. It's got the treadmill, the weight room, the jogging path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out President Bush can run again in the next election. Did you know this? Now, I know you're only supposed to be allowed two terms, but the Supreme Court said if you count his vacation time he's barely served one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, President Bush will make a special trip and fly to Albuquerque, New Mexico to sign the new national energy bill. You know, if you're trying to conserve energy, why not just sign the bill in Texas?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only politician trying to show how pro conservation they are by flying a plane 500 miles, taking a motorcade 30 miles, signing it, and then doing the whole thing back again. Sign it right here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are now accusations that&quot; Baltimore Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro &quot;may have lied when he testified in front of Congress. Lying to Congress. Well, you know what they say, 'When in Rome.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, I thought this was nice, he's in Crawford, Texas at the ranch there on a five-week vacation. How many of you folks get five weeks off every year? Five week vacation. Hey! Well, good for us. I haven't had five weeks off since NBC fired my ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is getting five weeks off and I was thinking about it. Let's see, record oil prices, gas is sky high, the economy is sluggish. Iraq is a mess. Yeah, I think he's earned five weeks off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Baltimore Orioles slugger Rafael Palmeiro may be prosecuted for lying to Congress about using steroids. They may prosecute him. Yeah, and after hearing this, Palmeiro was furious and said, 'They can kiss my frequently injected ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Tuesday, President Bush left for a five-week-long summer vacation. But the White House insists it's a working vacation. Yeah. Yeah, for instance, this morning the President worked on a model airplane and a fort made out of Legos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today at his ranch in Texas, President Bush met with the President of Colombia. The President of Colombia, yeah. At one point, the President of Colombia said, 'Can I use your bathroom? Those balloons I swallowed are killing me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is on a five-week vacation. That's maternity leave, that's not a vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney also taking five weeks off. But he's in a coma.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to President Bush's most recent physical, he is the most physically fit president in US history. ... He is in the 99 percentile for men his age. He said today he could be in the 100% league&quot; if his job &quot;didn't take up his whole morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Bush &quot;signed a free trade pact with Central America. I'm not sure President Bush understands a lot of these issues. Like, he said he owes a lot to Central America because those red states helped him win the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said he is fighting to include faith-based organizations in the government. Well, this is confusing. Because in Iraq, we're fighting to prevent faith-based organizations from taking over. It's hard to find the balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, we get a lot of tourists...and the city publishes a list of tourist destinations. Granted we are not very high up on that list. ... We are right between the Port Authority bus station and the birth place of Chuck Schumer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new 'Dukes of Hazzard' movie, what a wonderful film. ... The whole gang is back: Bo, Luke, Daisy, Boss Hogg, Cooter -- wait a minute, that was the Clinton White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while President Bush was out of town, Hillary Clinton stopped by the White House on Friday for an important meeting with her decorator.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of Middle Eastern leaders have now come forward to say they are opposed to terrorism. You get the feeling they're not that sincere, really?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of oil went up again. So, apparently this is what President Bush means when he says the economy is growing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of oil keeps going up -- at an all time record $63.99 a barrel. It would have hit $64 a barrel, but since the Saudis are our friends, apparently we got a discount there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the weekend president Clinton was on CNN talking about fighting obesity. Clinton says he fights obesity until she finally gives in and says yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is good news this will bring you real peace of mind. President Bush is on a five-week vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, before he went on vacation, signed a bill that will extend Daylight Savings Time by another month. They extend Daylight Savings Time. He says it proves we are winning the war on darkness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Rafael Palmeiro, are you following that? Now he claims he inadvertently ingested steroids, inadvertently ingested steroids. The same way Monica Lewinsky inadvertently ingested the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a radio speech this week, President Bush said, this is a quote, 'I will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job.' Yeah. Then, Bush went back to his five-week vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are all over this. They're complaining that President Bush has spent more than 21% of his time in office out of the White House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to know why your taxes are so high? Listen to this. This is absolutely true. The Los Angeles Daily News reporting the state of California has misplaced 30,000 government vehicles! Out of 70,000 state vehicles -- you know police cars, trucks. 30,000 or 40,000, rather are unaccounted for. How do you misplace 30,000 cars? That's a lot of drinking, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gasoline is at an all-time high this week. It's now officially $3 a gallon in California. Isn't that unbelievable. In fact this afternoon, I watched that new show, 'Pimp my Mountain Bike.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the good news is the space shuttle Discovery made a safe landing yesterday morning. That's exciting news. Landed right here. At Edwards Air Force Base. Right here in California. You know, because of the weather in Florida they didn't know if it was going to land in Florida, California, or New Mexico. They didn't know what state it was going to land in. So it's basically like every Southwest flight you've ever been on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another record set this week. Oil hit almost $66 a barrel. In fact, crude oil is so expensive now, a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken is $300.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seriously, I went to fill up this morning. There's a sign at the pump that says we take Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I filled up, they took my Visa, MasterCard and American Express.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Rolling Stones are in the news. Apparently, they've come out with an anti-Bush song. A song blasting President Bush. Not over the war in Iraq. Well, they're blasting him over Social Security. They're furious. This is an issue that affects them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They showed President Bush on the news today. And he was down on his ranch chopping wood. He was chopping wood with an ax, yeah. Which is kind of refreshing. Because no matter how many bills you sign destroying trees, there's nothing like doing it with your own two hands. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Crawford, Texas, President Bush met with his defense team and his foreign policy team. Yeah. Yeah, they briefed Bush on the state of global affairs, and he showed them how to pop a wheelie on a mountain bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush indicated today the President of Iran will receive a visa to come to the United States. I'm as shocked as you are. You still need a visa to get in here?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought we did away with that stuff years ago. 'Hey, there's a hole in the fence, hello!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extremists are no longer welcome in the United Kingdom. Looks like even Blair's trying to distance himself from Bush a little bit, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on his five-week vacation. He's taking five weeks off. It's like he's still in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This vacation has got the Democrats really upset. They're complaining President Bush has spent more than 21% of his time in office out of the White House. See, that's the difference between Bush and Bill Clinton right there. Clinton was never happier than when he was sitting behind that big desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, as you know President Bush is down there in Crawford, Texas. That is the garden spot of the south.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is on a five-week vacation, how many folks get five weeks off a year. You know, if I want five weeks off I have to have open heart surgery, for God's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But seriously, now is a great time for a vacation for President Bush. Because Iraq is pretty much under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But a White House spokesman says that President Bush is using his vacation to reconnect with regular people. So you know what that means, he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow, Cuban leader Fidel Castro turns 79. Yeah. You can tell Castro's getting older because he's thinking about retiring to Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Welcome to the tonight show. What a great crowd, eh? Y'all sound like a bunch of oil executives that just got their big bonuses this week.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news. You might have heard about officials are now backing off the statement that terrorists were planning to use fuel trucks for attacks in major cities. Remember that? What happens is the fuel prices are so high terrorists cannot afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Beverly Hills, gas is like $3.45 a gallon. Unbelievable. I heard people complaining about it in line at Starbucks while they were waiting to get their $5 cappuccino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, God bless him, is dealing with the situation. He just signed the new $282 billion highway bill. Pretty smart bill. His plan? All new roads will be built going downhill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President announced today that more and more dogs are being used in Iraq as bomb sniffers and mine detectors. How bad do you have to screw up in obedience school to get that job, huh? You know your other dog friends are sniffing for drugs in Malibu and at the Emmys. You're stuck in Iraq in 130 degrees looking for land mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush is now on week three of his marathon five-week vacation. In fact, he's been on vacation so long today in Washington a judge ruled that a young couple with two children can now legally move into the White House because it appears to be abandoned by its previous tenants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At his ranch in Texas over the weekend, President Bush threw out the first pitch at a Little League playoff game. Now see, I'm not sure President Bush knew this was a little league game. Like when he reached down and shook the hands of one of the players he said, 'This is proof our steroids policy is working.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A neighbor of President Bush's in Crawford, Texas, fired a shotgun in the air twice over the weekend. He was upset about all the protesters. He fired his gun in the air. That got President Bush pretty shaken up, because this is the closest he'd come to actual combat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news in Washington, have a month-long search the White House has hired the first female chef in White House history. The Administration, of course, is making a big deal out of the fact that she's female. Finally women getting into cooking, whoo. That glass ceiling has kept women out of the kitchen for years? It is now open, ladies and gentlemen. Women can now move into the kitchen. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what one of President Bush's favorite foods is? Peanut butter and honey sandwiches. That was one of Bill Clinton's favorites. The only difference is Clinton likes his honey on the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some exciting news from the world of science. We don't usually open with this. This is big news. Scientists at MIT have created the world's largest number. And they did it without using a computer. They used a gas pump and a Cadillac Escalade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God, the price of gas. It's an all-time high. You know, a lot of these gas station owners, I'm sorry, I think they're taking advantage. Like the gas station near my house, instead of a mini mart attached to it, it's now a Neiman Marcus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, gas is so expensive, today in Washington, Dick Cheney switched to a hybrid ambulance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey you think gas is expensive here? In Amsterdam -- $6.50 a gallon. In fact, today the Dutch boy took his finger out of the dike, gave it to the oil companies. That's how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush really understands this problem. Like today he said, 'If people think $67 is too much for a barrel of oil, then folks should just buy half a barrel. Share the barrel with your neighbor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight cities in Texas now are competing with one another to be the location for the George Bush presidential library. It's BYOB ? 'Bring Your Own Books,' basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A George Bush presidential library. That shouldn't take up too much space, should it? A box of cliff notes, a couple of pop-up books, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now see, we like President Bush. But President Bush doesn't really seem like a library guy, does he? The only thing Bush ever checked out of a library was Laura.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know it's going to be hard to find a good deli in Gaza now, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many are glad they're writing a new constitution in Iraq? How many wish they'd stop rewriting ours here at home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Turner is visiting North Korea this week. Oh, that's great. Now there are two mentally unbalanced dictators in North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The JP Morgan bank has agreed to pay $350 million to settle claims that they helped the Enron corporation commit fraud. I didn't even know Enron needed help committing fraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, the Rolling Stones are going back out on tour. Tickets over $100 apiece. But the good news, Medicare will kick in half. Medicare will pay for half of your tickets, so that's fabulous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week is the 66th anniversary of 'The Wizard of Oz.' ... But you know, 'The Wizard of Oz' is quite contemporary. It's a lot like Washington today. Cheney needs a heart. Bush needs a brain. The Senate needs some courage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Israeli government began moving thousands of Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. This is huge. Yeah. Yeah, and officials, officials say, once the area is cleared of all Jews, the land will be renamed Utah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Lance Armstrong is going on a bike ride with President Bush. Lance Armstrong and President Bush are gonna go bike riding.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news part of the reason for the high price of gas is oil companies have to refine over 40 different blends to meet regulations in different states. Almost every state has their own blend. Like here in California -- apparently they're blending it with Cristal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said on the news the high fuel prices have not stopped people from going on vacation this summer. Everybody's going on vacation -- Bush, Cheney, Congress. They're all going on vacation. They're not worried about this at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that -- President Bush woke up this morning, saw his shadow -- six more weeks of vacation, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the White House released the President's summer reading list. They said the President reading mostly nonfiction. He likes to save the fiction for when he needs a reason to invade another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush threw out the first pitch at a Little League playoff game. That must have been exciting. I mean, that's something those kids will remember until they're old and gray and have no Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Homeland Security being criticized for banning some babies from flights if the babies have terrorist-sounding names. See, I think that's a good thing. I think -- if there's one thing worse than sitting next to a baby, it's sitting next to a terrorist baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a poll in USA Today, 40% of Mexicans say they would move to the United States if they had the chance. The other 60% are already here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Israel began evacuating thousands of Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. It's big. Yeah. As a result, the Jewish settlers will be forced to return to their traditional home, Miami Beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was a kid I used to think cars of the future would be like what we saw in 'The Jetsons.' You know -- you fly around.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas is expensive everywhere. In Texas, angry wives are not using Mercedes anymore. They're driving over their husbands with hybrid cars now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the news tonight, they were giving tips on how to get better mileage. Little things. Like, this is true, they say is you -- you should keep your air-conditioner on and the windows shut because open windows increase drag and make you less aerodynamically efficient. Like in LA, if you're going to fire at another motorist, shoot out the back so that...you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of companies were affected by this Zotab computer virus thing. 'New York Times,' their computers down, ABC, their computers are down. It was really bad here at NBC. In fact, so many employees lost Internet access, productivity increased 86%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here at NBC are prepared for the next computer virus. What they're doing is they keep a deck of playing cards in their desks so they can continue playing solitaire until the computer -- until it comes back up again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 60 of President Bush's Crawford, Texas neighbors have signed petitions to keep protesters out of their area. They complained the roads are being clogged by the protesters' parked cars. Turns out those don't belong to the protesters, just people who've run out of gas, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight cities in Texas are now competing with one another to be the location for the George Bush presidential library. Does President Bush really need a library?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Kansas City Royals have now lost 18 games in a row. 18 in a row. They are closing in on the all-time record for the most losing. Yeah. Currently held by the French army, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven cities in Texas are competing to be the future home of the George W. Bush presidential library. That's right. President Bush. Or as President Bush plans to call it, 'My Learnin' Shed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. What a terrific crowd. There you go. Yes! You sound like a bunch of Democrats looking at President Bush's approval ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a strange thing happen to me last night. ... About 10:30, I'm sitting around. I'm watching TV. I'm just sitting at my house. The doorbell rings. I open the door, it's the head guy from FEMA at my door. I said, 'What are you doing here?' He said, 'Oh, I'm here for the earthquake damage you had back in '94.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, FEMA stands for, 'Fix Everything, My Ass!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And even President Bush, almost a week later, President Bush said his Administration's response to Hurricane Katrina was unacceptable. And then he said, 'Hey, don't blame me. I was on vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although, to his credit, to his credit, President Bush did respond quickly and he did send troops as soon as he found out Louisiana had oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And these Louisiana politicians -- you see some of them on the news? One guy -- I was watching one guy on MSNBC yesterday. He said he wasn't worried about the looting. Well, sure, compared to what politicians have stolen, those citizens have a long way to go -- a long way to go to catch up with those guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US Border Patrol agents allowed a man, called the human cannonball, to shoot himself across the border from Mexico to the United States. The Border Patrol gave him special permission to do this because, as you know, they don't let just anyone cross the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. Do you know you don't even have to be a lawyer to be a Supreme Court justice? Do you know that? You have to be a lawyer. Just like you don't have to be an emergency expert to work for FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching this movie. I come across 'Mad Max: Road warrior.' Remember that movie? There's the scene where Mel Gibson is driving the gas truck. He's being chased by all these people trying to kill him to get the gas. And I realized the movie took place sometime in the future. I believe it was October!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Centers for Disease Control -- this is true -- announced that new batches of heroin on the East Coast are filled with a dangerous additive used in cattle and they think it could make heroin users sick. So please -- only buy your heroin from a reputable dealer or someone your parents know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And rap mogul Suge Knight shot in the leg at the MTV parties. He got shot in the leg. Of course, the big question, what did Suge do to piss off Pat Robertson?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night's &quot;audience was rough. I knew I was in trouble when the White House sent over former Presidents Clinton and Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials are saying it's gonna take 80 days -- 80 days to drain all the floodwater from Hurricane Katrina out of New Orleans. 80 days, yeah. And when he heard this, President Bush said, '80 days? That's almost half a vacation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During an interview this week, Celine Dion criticized President Bush for the slow evacuation of New Orleans. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Celine said, 'I could have driven everyone out of that city in two songs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have heard today -- the big news, President Bush announced a plan to put a man on Mars. It's the head of FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, last week the people of New Orleans were hit by a WMB, weapon of mass bureaucracy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know the difference between FEMA and Social Security? There's a chance you might actually live long enough to get help from Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Congress announced a plan to rename the Gulf of Mexico. They want to call it 'Persian Gulf 2' and hope that President Bush would send troops there faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, today, President Bush sent Vice President Dick Cheney to New Orleans. Is that what we need down there? Another person requiring emergency medical help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to his credit, Vice President Cheney said he will stay down there in Louisiana until every single oil derrick is safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Federal Government is now going to give $2,000 to each victim of the hurricane. They're saying to use for anything they want -- food, shelter, a tank of gas, whatever they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news, I filled my tank today for under $20. Hey, it was for my lawnmower, but, you know, hey, it's a beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you, these oil companies -- boy, they're starting to get cocky. Have you noticed this? Like, at the gas station near my house -- you know the price sign -- they don't have a price sign anymore, just a little hand giving you the finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know who's really enjoying these high gas prices? The Amish. Oh, they think this is the funniest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview on Iraqi television, the new Iraqi president said that Saddam Hussein has confessed to the ordering -- to ordering the deaths of thousands of Kurds. We have a confession, or as California juries call that, reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People magazine is reporting that chief justice nominee John Roberts -- you know, President Bush's nominee for chief justice -- is ambidextrous. And to his credit, President Bush said, 'You know, what he does in the privacy of his own bedroom...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the California legislature became the first legislative body in the country to approve same-sex marriages. If the governor signs the bill, California gays will finally be allowed to marry someone other than Liza Minelli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the city of Los Angeles celebrated its 224th birthday. That's pretty amazing. 224 years, LA has gone from a a sleepy little village with no housing and public transportation to a huge city with no housing and public transportation. It's amazing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one embarrassing moment at the party when the new mayor went to cut the cake and 17 illegals jumped out and took off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many folks have been watching the miniseries on HBO about Rome? Tremendously exciting episode this week. Rome is burning while Nero refuses to cut his vacation short.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And don't miss next week's episode when FEMA takes a week to show up at Pompeii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I guess you know by now President Bush has been accused of being slow to respond to the hurricane, and actually so far he's also been slow to respond to that accusation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, wherever there is trouble, they send in the former Presidents Clinton and Bush. That's what they do now. And earlier today they visited the Yankee clubhouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this, Monica Lewinski, you remember her, she is moving to England, moving to England. And I'm thinking, 'Oh oh, I see an impeachment in Tony Blair's future.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's a good story. Monica has been accepted to London School of Economics. That's great. London School of Economics. And I'm thinking, 'This is a tremendous opportunity, Monica, don't blow it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Americans are calling on President Bush to fire the head of FEMA, Michael Brown, because of the slow response to the crisis. They want to fire him. Yeah. Unfortunately, due to the red tape, firing Brown will take six to eight months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government has chartered three luxury cruise ships to house families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. They're gonna put them on cruise ships, yeah. Because there's one thing those people want to see is more water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats in California are trying to find a candidate to run against Arnold Schwarzenegger next year. Yeah, they want to run against Arnold. They think they can take him, yeah. Unfortunately, the only person who's as qualified as Arnold Schwarzenegger is Vin Diesel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We asked three celebrities to complete a phrase. Okay? Our first phrase was...'I think FEMA is...' FEMA head Michael Brown said, 'Doing the best job under tough circumstances.' Jesse Jackson wrote, 'Woefully unprepared for the task at hand.' George W. Bush wrote, 'A good name for a unicorn.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The new chief justice of the Supreme Court should be...' Rudolph Giuliani wrote, 'Conservative, but also rational.' Al Gore wrote, 'Liberal, but also practical.' George W. Bush wrote, 'FEMA the Unicorn.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces in Iraq have rescued an American contractor who was kidnapped there last November 1st. Unbelievable. It's a pretty amazing story. The guy was completely out of touch with the rest of the world for ten months. He did not even know who the new president was. He didn't know. Didn't know. Although, he did know that Brad and Jen had broken up.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a big announcement today from FEMA. They say they now have reason to believe a hurricane may have hit New Orleans. They cannot confirm any of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people now are blaming President Bush for not evacuating New Orleans sooner. But, hey, we're lucky to get him to evacuate Crawford, Texas. How long was he down there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today President Bush asked if his visit to the hurricane zone would count towards his service time he still owed the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the waters have receded somewhat in New Orleans, it is still a huge, huge problem. It will be for months to come. Like, the fresh water is contaminated with oil and gasoline. Or as Dick Cheney puts it, the oil and gasoline is contaminated with fresh water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of foreign countries are helping out. Our neighbor Mexico is helping out with relief efforts. Yeah, Mexico, they're sending trucks. In fact, each truck has 25 relief workers in it, another 30 hidden underneath it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush spoke at the funeral of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. One kind of embarrassing moment. After his eulogy, President Bush realized by mistake he brought along the speech he was supposed to give at Gilligan's funeral. Yeah. When he said, 'Good-bye, Little Buddy,' that's when people realized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the California legislature approved same-sex marriages. This is great news if you're a gay, illegal alien in California. Now you can get your marriage license and driver's license all on the same day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what this means? Now, wedding planners will be able to plan their own weddings. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But opponents claim that passing this gay marriage bill would make a mockery of the institution of marriage here in California. I think Hollywood already did that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Governor Schwarzenegger says we will veto. And if Schwarzenegger does veto it, this would be the biggest setback for gays since Cher announced her retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight was the start of the big NFL season. They had a big game before the concert tonight. I understand Kanye West performed. He said George Bush doesn't care about running backs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crime apparently is back up in New York City. Earlier today, thieves robbed an armored truck, robbed an armored truck. They left the money, but siphoned out the gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the network NBC is 79 years old. 79 years old. And NBC sent an invitation to President Bush for their 79th birthday party, but so far he's been slow to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, true story, the government of Mexico sent a Navy ship packed with food and supplies to help in the hurricane relief effort. Isn't that nice? A whole ship. Mexico sent a whole ship. Yeah. Yeah, reportedly it's the largest shipment from Mexico to the United States since Snoop Dogg's birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week there's gonna be a New Orleans benefit concert in Madison Square Garden featuring Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Stevie Nicks. That's a nice thing, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, apparently -- apparently, their plan to save New Orleans is to send it back to the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, a spokesperson for NBC said that rapper Kanye West's recent comment that President Bush doesn't care about black people does not reflect the opinion of NBC. Yeah. Actually, it's NBC's primetime line-up that suggests NBC doesn't care about black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just barely a week after Hurricane Katrina, another hurricane is brewing off the coast of Florida. Did you know that? Yeah, and apparently, there's a pretty good chance the hurricane's gonna be serious, 'cause this morning, President Bush left on vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news today, the most important evacuation was made today in New Orleans. They got the head of FEMA, Mike Brown, out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had to let this guy go. Did you see what he did today? He sent Chief Justice William Rehnquist a 'get well soon' card. He doesn't get it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when they told him they were letting him go, he was stunned. He just sat there he couldn't move. It was just like when the hurricane hit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is FEMA like 'Baywatch?' Whenever they rescue someone, they do it in slow motion. Slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush sent Vice President Dick Cheney down to New Orleans as part of their massive White House effort called 'Operation Cover Your Ass.' Get everybody down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Vice President's press conference in Mississippi, a heckler kept yelling obscenities at him. Yelling obscenities at the Vice President. You know something, this time Hillary has gone too far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One nice thing is a lot of foreign countries are helping us out. Like today France made a donation. They sent a truck load of white flags for people to wave to be rescued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Los Angeles City Council has passed a new law so people can write a check to have city workers do things like have pot holes filled faster. Didn't that used to be called taxes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is good news. Seems the toll in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia -- remember that? The meltdown they had? They said the earth would be, you know, would be -- terrible. Couldn't use for million years. They say it maybe less serious, now, than they first thought. That was reported by FEMA, who just got over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here is exciting news. Tonight on the Late Show, our new cue card holder is former head of FEMA, Michael Brown. Take a bow, Michael.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is saying now that FEMA was slow to respond. And I think maybe FEMA is slow. I think FEMA actually is just slow because they are just now starting to respond to Tom Cruise's appearance on Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officials are warning Americans to be careful when they donate to the Hurricane Katrina funds, because several Websites on the Internet are scams. That's true. Too bad, but they're scams, yeah. Too bad. Yeah, apparently the funds to avoid are the ones that ask for a check and nude photos of your girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, this is the big story. Michael Brown, the controversial head of FEMA, was relieved of his duties in New Orleans. They relieved him. He's gone, yeah. Yeah, he's been told to report to Washington immediately, which means he should get there in about a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles blackout &quot;was kind of scary because when the power went out all over the city, a lot of people&quot; thought &quot;it was al Qaeda. It turns out the power line was accidentally cut by a Department of Water and Power employee. S o it turns out it wasn't terrorism. Whoo, it was just incompetence.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear what Kanye West said about the power outage? Did you hear about this? He said George Bush does not care about blackouts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess we found out today what Brown can do for you. He can resign!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The executive director of FEMA, Mike Brown has resigned. You know, and I think they -- well, I think they knew he was a little slow. Like, today, they gave him a year and a half to clean out his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Brown said he was stepping down because he was an ineffective leader who had lost the confidence of the people. After hearing this, Bush said, 'That's no reason to quit your job! What are you doing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Brown said he's going back to Washington, DC to get more hands-on disaster experience. So I think they're gonna have him run Amtrak for a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the bright side, this does make Brown the only person in the Bush Administration so far to have an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you know Brown is a lawyer? This is my favorite part, he's a lawyer. Leave it to Bush to find the only lawyer in history who is slow getting to a disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is going to be a huge scandal because according to the Washington Post, five out of the top eight FEMA officials got their jobs with no experience in handling disasters. Many were hired just 'cause they worked on the Bush campaign in 2000. See, see this is wrong. I mean, if they wanted people with experience in handling disasters, get people who worked on the Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We joke, but there have been improvements. FEMA said today to avoid any delays in the future or they're going to get call waiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney is down in New Orleans. He was down there over the weekend along with hundreds of doctors, nurses and emergency medical people. Unfortunately they're all there helping Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, also down in New Orleans. There's one kind of embarrassing moment today for President Bush when a National Guard general stopped him and said, 'Private Bush, is that you? Where have you been the last 30 years?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating is now below 40% for the first time ever. 40%. President Bush hadn't seen numbers this low since college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard by now that California legislature has agreed to allow gays to marry. You see, this is good. This way -- well, you see what I am saying? No, think about it. This way, you'll now have two people excited about planning the wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this, Hurricane Ophelia, now may strike the East Coast? And I was thinking about this. The Bush Administration is getting ready to ignore it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First it was Katrina, and now it was Ophelia. Maybe people would take these storms far seriously if they didn't have cute girl names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, the last Israeli troops have left Gaza, and I believe it's the most historic pull out since...well, since Hillary walked in on Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, a lot of industries here in California affected by the blackout. In fact, up in Barstow, a lot of the meth labs, still not back up online.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, today they found the source of the blackout. It was not terrorism. Turns out, Ryan Seacrest's blow-dryer. Yeah, apparently he had been using it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush toured New Orleans. He saw something that was below sea level -- his approval rating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, I think Bush is trying a little too hard now to show how much he cares. Have you seen today? Like, he's in New Orleans this morning. He met with Cindy Sheehan in the middle of a flooded street while hugging a black guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know how FEMA spells relief? Yeah, they don't know either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Big Daddy's Strip Club is getting ready to reopen for business. Downtown New Orleans, Big Daddy himself ? Big Daddy defied the evacuation order. He hung in. He stayed his strip club through this whole ordeal, and he's waiting for electricity to come on so he can open his club. This is kind of courageous story that brings America -- this brings America to its knees, to see this kind of dedication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this stupid tape made by this alleged al Qaeda kid who's actually an American kid from Orange County, California? Did you see this tape? They're calling him now Laguna bin Laden, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Idiot. He's from Orange County! Remember the old days when the only extremists in Orange County were Republicans? What happened here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know how the authorities knew the kid was from Orange County? After he made his 'Death to America' speech, he got in his dad's Porsche and drove away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I watched some great softball today. The Senate hearings on John Roberts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Supreme Court chief nominee John Roberts said in his opening statement -- this is what he said at his confirmation hearing. He said he has no agenda and he has no platforms. Do you know what that means? He could be the next Democratic presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crazy, George Bush is coming&quot; to New York City, &quot;and there is a big UN Summit meeting taking place. Countries all over the world. Here is something funny that was happening. The current president of Afghanistan was taking a cab. And he was actually picked up and driven in the cab by the former president of Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the John Roberts confirmation hearings? It can be a little dull, so they've changed the format. For example, he has to give his answers in the form of a question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the senators all get to begin with opening statements. And earlier today, Ted Kennedy took ten minutes to tell his version of 'The Aristocrats.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, former FEMA director Michael Brown resigned. He says that he wants to spend more time not responding to his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, he resigned. And he now plans to be ineffective in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington insiders now saying that President Bush is becoming increasingly isolated. Increasingly isolated. People, staff members are afraid to bring him bad news or tell him when he is wrong. And -- now wait a minute, that's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Questions For The FEMA Director Application: 10. Are you able to convey a false sense of security?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. What percentage of your resume is fabricated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a crisis, which state or local officials would you blame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. What are your plans after you resign? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Northwest Airlines became the first commercial airline to resume flights to New Orleans. Isn't that good? Yeah. They're flying to New Orleans. Very good. Yeah. Yeah. In order to prepare passengers for the disaster in New Orleans, the in-flight movie was 'Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Michael brown, the head of FEMA, who was heavily criticized for his handling of the Katrina disaster, decided to resign. He stepped down. Yeah, people were mad. Yeah. Brown's next job is overseeing NBC's fall lineup.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to our 3,000th show. 3,000th show tonight. You know, I was thinking of that, 3,000 shows. We did our first show in May of '92. A man named George Bush was president. His approval rating was only 39%. And someone named Clinton wanted to replace him in the White House. So nothing has changed, really. Basically, nothing has changed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was in New Orleans this week, President Bush said he met a lot of 'can do' people. That's what he said -- he met 'can do' people. Then someone said, 'It's pronounced 'Cajun people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night, in a speech to the nation, President Bush will do what he does best, explaining what went wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush has taken personal responsibility for this failed response of FEMA. He also hinted that he might have had something to do with that Iraqi war thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush &quot;said racism played no part in the slow rescue effort. And you know something, he's right. See, that's the one good thing about incompetence, it is color blind. It really doesn't take sides one way or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore gave a fiery speech this week, criticizing the Bush Administration, really attacked him. And then Gore took questions from some of the other people waiting in line at the Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of celebrities are helping out the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Shaquille O'Neal donated money. You know what else he did? He donated several pairs of his autographed sneakers, and today those sneakers are being used as kayaks to rescue people in the waters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that is a massive job. They say the toxic water and the sludge smell so bad in New Orleans, they're now thinking of renaming the city Newark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the very first businesses to reopen in New Orleans will be a place called Big Daddy's Strip Club. That will be one of the first places. Nice to see FEMA is finally getting involved in this thing, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, boy, this is going to cause huge problems. In a landmark legal case just a few hours ago, a Federal judge in San Francisco said the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools is unconstitutional because you can't say the words 'under God.' You know, forget 'under God.' How about getting the kids out from under the teachers first?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, women in New York City have sex more times per week than women in any other part of the country. They say it's a result of a more permissive attitude and the fact that Hillary is out of town a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBA players visited the Houston Astrodome and the Knicks, the Knicks ended up losing 110 to 85 to the hurricane survivors, actually beat the Knicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush warned the president of Syria to stop letting terrorists into Iraq. Yeah. And then the president of Syria warned Bush to start paying attention to national disasters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then later Bush asked the Chinese delegates to explain their version of checkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crazy day in Manhattan today. You people notice that today? Manhattan's insane. Traffic was horrible in Manhattan today because 170 world leaders are in town for the anniversary of the United Nations. 170 world leaders. On the bright side, all 170 leaders were able to find a cab driver who spoke their language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, at his confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee John Roberts said, quote, 'Good lawyers can argue any side of a case.' Then Roberts said, 'No, they can't.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you here. Now, if you flew out here on Northwest or Delta to say the Pledge of Allegiance, this is not your week, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Federal judge in San Francisco has ruled it is unconstitutional to say the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools because it contains the words 'under God.' All right, let's say you go to school, and you say the Pledge of Allegiance, and you get arrested. What happens when you go to trial? You go to trial. And what do they say to you when you're on trial? 'Do you swear to tell the whole truth, so help you God?' You're back at square one again.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke tonight about the problems with the relief effort, and afterwards Kanye West gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To his credit, President Bush took some of the blame for the slow relief effort of Hurricane Katrina. In fact, he said, this is probably why he's not going to run for a third term.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give you an idea how low President Bush's approval rating is? He's now three points below NBC. That is not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes the press looks for the most ridiculous -- they released a photo today. See that picture of President Bush scribbling a note to Condoleezza Rice during a meeting of the UN Security Council. They had a camera right over the President's shoulder, and the President wrote a note that he needed a bathroom break. Now, I'm not making -- here's the real note. This is not made up. It says, 'I think I need a bathroom break.' Why is this news?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How old is the press, 10? 'He has to go to the bathroom!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, he gave the note to Condoleezza Rice, and did you see her reply? We have the Web camera of her reply. She sent a note back. There she is there. And can we get a shot of that note? 'You should have thought of that before we left the house!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security, out tonight with new alert system color codes. The highest alert is red. The lowest alert is Brown -- as in FEMA's Michael brown, when you're not aware of anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do we even send in FEMA? Why don't we send in those folks from 'Trading Spaces' or 'Extreme Makeover.' They can fix something in like a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you've been watching these hearings for the Supreme Court justice, John Roberts, the John Roberts hearing. Is it me, or is Ted Kennedy's head getting bigger?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Roberts said today if he is given the job of Supreme Court justice, as a judge, he would be guided by the law. Well, duh! What else is he going to say? 'Oh, I like to decide cases using the magic eight ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger will announce tomorrow whether he plans to run for a second term, or as he calls it, a 'see-kwil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's good news if he runs. It would be good. Well, this way, at least we know he's planning not to go back into acting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to researchers at the University of California San Francisco, a hallucinogenic drug may be effective in treating alcoholism.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actress Kirstie Alley has &quot;lost 50 pounds. ... But you know how she did it? Apparently, she is on the FEMA diet. You ask for food, and nothing shows up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm a little worried about something, earlier today I received a phone call from George Bush, and he says, 'Dave, you're doing a heck of a job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's going on at the UN this week, the big worldwide conference, 170 world leaders are meeting at the UN this week, tremendous. Earlier today, I thought I saw Kim Jong Il coming out of Flash Dancers, right over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was with his father, Mentally Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was very odd, the UN world hunger delegation, you know, the UN world hunger delegation, they ran up a $50,000 room service bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today in Mississippi, eight dolphins who were washed out of an aquarium during the hurricane were rescued from the Gulf of Mexico. Isn't that nice? Yeah, afterwards, afterwards the dolphins said, 'Thank God we've been saved from swimming freely in the ocean and put back in our tank.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During his testimony in front of the Senate today, this is the latest. Supreme Court nominee John Roberts said that his favorite movie is 'Doctor Zhivago.' Isn't that nice? 'Doctor Zhivago' is his favorite movie. President Bush said, 'I also loved Doctor Zhivago, especially the part where he talks to the animals.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow! Thank you. What a crowd. You sound like comedians when you heard Arnold Schwarzenegger was gonna run again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many think Arnold should run for another term? How many think it's time for California to be governed by a new 'action hero,' like Stallone or Chuck Norris? Where is Vin Diesel when we need him?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Arnold said, in his second term, it will be a prequel. He will actually be younger when he comes back. He will now be governor before he was governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush spoke to the nations from the historic Jackson Square in New Orleans. You see the speech? Did you watch him? He wasn't wearing a tie. He wasn't wearing a jacket. See, they took all that stuff away from him. Apparently, his approval rating is so low they have him on a suicide watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one kind of embarrassing moment when they pointed to giant statue in the square and told President Bush it was Andrew Jackson, and Bush said, 'Now, is he the oldest or is it Tito?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some analysts said, the most striking thing about President Bush's speech last night was the fact that he didn't name someone to be in charge of the reconstruction. See, if Bush was smart, put Clinton in charge. Think about this. No, hear me out here. I mean, if you want women flashing their breasts by Mardi Gras, Clinton is the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in California, these monster waves from a storm in Tahiti are hitting the California coast, just hard, hard, damaging homes in Malibu. Well, you thought Bush was slow to help in New Orleans, wait until he finds out he's got to bail out Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fallujah would be rebuilt before Malibu!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hubble space telescope back in the news. You all remember the Hubble space telescope. Well, it has now detected a black hole in space. Scientists have studied this, and they determined that the black hole is homeless. That's what they said. And today, Kanye West accused President Bush of not caring about homeless black holes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post is reporting that Monica Lewinsky is heading to the London School of Economics. At her going away party, she said, 'Maybe I'll meet my husband there.' That's what she said. See, I thought she was going there to study. You know, maybe she could focus on the work on top of the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honest to God there must be like four million rats living in New York City, and not just regular rats, these are enormous rats. ... This is a very serious rat infestation problem, and so far, the response from Washington has been very slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We keep hearing these reports out of Washington DC that George Bush is depressed. He's depressed. His staff is afraid to give him bad news. In fact, they still haven't told him about Gilligan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush on Wednesday spoke at the UN. And during the speech, did you hear about this, he passes a note to Condoleezza Rice saying, 'I need to go to the bathroom. Is there any way I can get a bathroom break?' And I was thinking 'Well, there you go. He's drinking again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A group of scientists is very worried because -- this is serious. Because mice infected with bubonic plague have escaped and are on the loose in Newark, New Jersey. That's true. Yeah, apparently, these scientists are worried for the mice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced on Friday, he's running for reelection, or at least that's what people think he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New York, a man has set the Guinness world record for being a couch potato. The guy spent 68 hours and 48 minutes straight watching TV. It's nice to see FEMA Director Mike Brown landed on his feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big question now, what's going to get dried out first -- New Orleans or Governor Jeb Bush's son?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's nephew John Ellis Bush, who is Jeb Bush's son was arrested for public drunkenness and resisting arrest. Not good. Apparently, the family is concerned that his behavior will hurt his chances of having a political career, but didn't hurt Uncle George!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview in People magazine, former President Bill Clinton says he's a big fan of the movie 'March of the Penguins.' He identified with the movie because his mate is also half-frozen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks watched the 57th annual Emmy Awards last night right here on CBS? ... But did you think it was a long show? Did it kind of seem like a long show? I was sitting there, it was dragging on and on, and I said to myself, where's FEMA?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say that the show was a disaster, but former Presidents Clinton and Bush are showing up at the scene today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Korea said they would give up their nuclear weapons program in exchange for security from the United States. Is that a good idea?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney is going to have elective surgery on an aneurysm they found in an artery behind his knee, behind his knee. See, apparently they bypassed Cheney's heart so many times, they're now halfway down his legs now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Los Angeles and Orange County are considering building underground freeways to try and alleviate the horrible traffic jams. Underground freeways.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA announced this week it'll cost $104 billion for a new manned mission to the moon. To the moon. Going to the moon? Can we do that kind of stuff anymore? I mean, doesn't the Federal Government have its hands full right now with rain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Hurricane Rita, oh, my God, is now heading towards Florida and Texas and Louisiana. It's another -- it's like the ninth hurricane this season. You know, maybe this is not a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hurricane Rita, see, that doesn't sound powerful. Even Katrina. You see what I am saying? We need hurricane names to let you know how unpredictable and dangerous they are. Like 'Hurricane Courtney Love.' You know, get the hell out of here. You know, you know you're going to get hit with a bottle. Something's gonna happen to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three laboratory mice that were in an infectious disease lab in New Jersey have escaped. Authorities have asked citizens to be on the lookout for the lab mice. They're about this big. They're white. They have red eyes, and each mouse is smoking a dozen cigarettes at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major League Baseball reported today that the number of home runs this season is the lowest it's been in eight years. I wonder what's causing that? How many think it's 'cause the batters are no longer taking steroids?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Globe, after Sharon Stone moved out of her rental in London, she left behind the private phone number of Bill Clinton. That's what it said. Which is pretty amazing, considering even Hillary doesn't have the private number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is another hurricane down South, Hurricane Rita. Hurricane Rita, that's right. Hitting Florida and this time President Bush is not screwing around.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the Federal Government asked the people of New Orleans not to return to the city because it's still not safe. The latest, yeah. Then the government said the same thing to the people of Detroit, Cleveland and Newark.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls, President Bush's approval ratings are at an all-time low right now. Yeah. In response the President said, 'Yeah, but my disapproval ratings are at an all-time high.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI is being criticized, right now, for having their priorities mixed up because this week they launched a huge investigation into the adult porn industry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like there's another scandal brewing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush keeping track of Hurricane Rita hitting his home state of Texas. That's Bush's worst nightmare. An electric chair with no power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, as you know, winds have now been clocked at over 150 miles an hour. That's not the hurricane. That's from oil industry executives rushing to raise prices.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, the Texas Air National Guard was recalled to Louisiana. President Bush said these brave men and women should be commended for all of the work they do. Of course, Bush didn't have firsthand knowledge of what the National Guard actually does, but...he heard it was important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people are wondering now if global warming is to blame for these hurricanes. Maybe, but, hey, how about Kirstie Alley losing all of that weight? That's got to affect the tide. Don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today she has decided to vote against the nomination of John Roberts for the Supreme Court. She said it was a matter of conscience. When she explained this to her husband, he said, 'a matter of what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech to the California Nurses Association, Warren Beatty the actor spoke out against Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's policy. Some people think he might run against him for governor. Imagine that. Warren and Arnold running against each other. You know, if we could just get Paris Hilton in this race, between the three of them, they would have screwed everybody in LA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Bush Administration's asked the FBI to conduct a war on pornography. There you go. When asked about the strategy for the war against pornography, the head of the FBI said, 'We're going to fight this thing single handedly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their goal -- to arrest every guy with a computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Forbes came out with this week with the list of the 400 richest Americans, as we call it, the Bush Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geena Davis &quot;has a new show on ABC called 'Commander in Chief,' where she plays the first female president, or as a Democrat would call it, a futuristic reality show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I think that's good. It's nice to see a woman sitting behind the president's desk instead of under it, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supermodel Kate Moss has been dropped from a top modeling contract after she was caught on tape snorting cocaine. But the good news, she's the new spokesman for Hoover vacuum cleaner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, running for re-election. That time already, running for re-election. And this time, as opposed to be running as a mediocre actor, he will be running as a mediocre governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqis will soon vote on their constitution. Vote on their constitution. They will have the choice of voting yes or blowing something up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today about Hurricane Rita, President Bush declared, 'This is a big storm.' True. In a related story, the White House announced that President Bush has started writing his own speeches.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, of course the big story continues to be the evacuation from the hurricane -- the hiding, the running. But enough about President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember that movie last year 'The Day After Tomorrow' where the earth's climate was going crazy? Remember that movie? Doesn't that seem like the good old days?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbra Streisand told Diane Sawyer that we're in a global warming emergency and we can expect more and more intense storms, droughts and dust bowls. But before they act, experts say they're still waiting to hear from Celine Dion. Of course Barry Gibb has not spoken up yet either, right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, scientists say they have more evidence of global warming. In fact, today a penguin in Antarctica walked only 60 miles to get laid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush -- see, I don't think he understands a lot of these things. He gave his solution to global warming. He said global air conditioning. That is what we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This really is good news -- Hurricane Rita was not as bad for Texas as people thought it was going to be. In fact, Enron did more damage to Houston than Hurricane Rita.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'Star,' the makers of the 'Girls Gone Wild' videos -- you know those hoo-hoo, 'Girls Gone Wild' videos -- they are giving 100% of their profits from the Mardis Gras DVDs and videos to the Red Cross for hurricane relief. Well, how many guys are going to jump on that one, huh? 'Honey, I didn't want to buy these. We are helping.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an announcement today, President Bush said all Federal workers should travel less to save fuel. He decided this in Texas before he flew to Colorado back to Washington to prepare for tomorrow's trip back to Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is turning into quite a scandal. The National Enquirer -- you know them, they check, recheck and check the facts. They say President Bush has started drinking again. You thought he was falling off his bicycle before. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you worried President Bush might be drinking again? Why? I mean, let's say he is drinking. It would be hard to screw up more than we already have, right? I say have a few more drinks. Maybe that will help! How about an extra one? Have two or three, what the hell!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has announced she is gonna vote 'no' -- she is voting 'no' on the nomination of Judge Roberts for the Supreme Court Justice. Today Bill Clinton pulled Judge Roberts aside and told him, 'Don't take it personally. I get 'no' from her all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you may know, President Bush has asked the FBI to start an anti-obscenity task force to fight the war against pornography. Yes, sir. So far, US forces apprehended a pizza boy, a pool guy, and a naughty cheerleader.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, sir, we've got -- we have them in custody! They're in Abu Ghraib right as we speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Bush said he -- he's serious about this war on pornography. He said he will seek out and find all weapons of masturbation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A war on pornography. Won't see a lot of guys dodging the draft on this one. Hey, where do you sign up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, this could be an expensive war. It's already $3.99 for the first minute and $1.99 after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, forget a war on pornography. How about a war on gas prices? Why don't we start with that?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This way guys can afford to go out of the house once in a while and wouldn't have to sit home and watch pornography.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the National Enquirer -- this is the National Enquirer -- they say President Bush's started drinking again. He'll do anything to get Ted Kennedy's support for that Supreme Court nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush drinking again. That can't be good news for North Korea!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, look, suppose he is drinking. Who cares, really? Does it matter? He's the President, right? I mean, he doesn't drive anywhere, so that's not a danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got the Secret Service agents right there to catch him if he stumbles. Plus, Dick Cheney is a designated brain, so it doesn't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had surgery over the weekend. Luckily, a huge success, he had 18 organs replaced. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Milton Bradley people just came out with this. This is the new Dick Cheney operation game. See how it works? You can do your own knee surgery there. They got the heart surgery. It's a fabulous, fabulous game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has asked Americans to drive less in order to conserve fuel. And to show their support, how about this, the LA Dodgers announced they will stay home, not go to the playoffs this year to save fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some good news, the Bush Administration captured their number one terror suspect yesterday. Anti-war protester, Cindy Sheehan. Yes, she was arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she was the Ace of Spades, wasn't she, if I'm not mistaken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who she is, Cindy Sheehan? She is the mother who was demonstrating down there in Texas. She was arrested at the White House for sitting down, doing nothing, and refusing to move. You know, if that's the criteria, they should arrest all of those White House energy advisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former head of FEMA, Michael Brown, testified about what went wrong in their response to the Hurricane Katrina. He said he did a good job. He put all of the blame on state and local officials. This guy's good, he could run for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people think global warming is causing these terrible hurricanes. See, I think we should stop global warming. We should move in the other direction. See, we should move toward a second ice age. Follow me -- I mean, if giant glaciers are coming at us, like, an inch a year, then the government would have time to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is the strangest story to come out of Hurricane Katrina. This is so bizarre. It seems a group of armed dolphins, who were trained by the military to shoot terrorists, are missing in the Gulf of Mexico. I'm not making this up. They said they got lost during the hurricane and they're carrying dart guns, putting divers at risk. How scary is this for these poor people in New Orleans? You finally get back in your house, look out in your yard, you get shot in the ass by a dolphin. What is that all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor of Georgia is asking state schools to close a few days this week to conserve gas 'cause of Hurricane Katrina's effect on the nation's fuel supply. He feels if students stayed home, it would save gas, school buses wouldn't be used, you know, parents wouldn't drive their kids. You know, I got a better idea. Childhood obesity is a huge problem, right? Keep the schools opened. Make these fat ass kids walk to school.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry said today, he was never clear about where Supreme Court nominee John Roberts stood on the issues and for that reason, he is not voting for him. That's the same reason Roberts didn't vote for Kerry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI announced they have created a task force to go after pornography. They have declared a war on pornography. Do you know what this means? Our nation may have to tap into our national porn reserve. Luckily, we men have enough backup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard these rumors that Warren Beatty may be running for governor against Schwarzenegger? Isn't that fabulous? Two actors. Hilarious. If we could get Gary Coleman back in the race, you know, we could call it 'Two and a Half Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to German researchers, frequent sex releases hormones that increase your intelligence. Sex makes you smarter. Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush hinted that his next choice for a Supreme Court nominee could be a minority. Yeah. The President said it could be a Latino or it could be a Chinese-o.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching that reality show where they kick someone out of the house. Tom DeLay. That's who it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Texas grand jury indicted House Majority Leader Tom DeLay for conspiracy in a campaign finance scheme. This is the most embarrassing thing that happened to the Republicans since yesterday.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Republicans like Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston would get in trouble, it would be for sex scandals. Tom DeLay is in trouble for money. Or as Republicans call it, this is the return to traditional values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of fuel shortages, President Bush has asked all Americans to cut back on unnecessary travel. You know, like trips to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia said today they now have twice as much oil as they thought they had. Which means they can now screw us twice as much as they thought they could before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former FEMA Director Mike Brown testified before Congress, and he rejected criticism that he was inexperienced. He said, 'I have overseen over 150 presidentially declared disasters.' So he's not inexperienced, just incompetent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eighty-seven-year-old Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia announced he is seeking another term. He wants six more years. Well, so does every other 87-year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush is going to appear on a reality show. She's going to be on 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.' Laura Bush is believed to be the first First Lady ever to appear on a reality show. Although when Clinton was president, he did try to get Hillary on 'Wife Swap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush flew over the battered region yesterday in Marine One during his 150th visit there since Hurricane Katrina. Actually, it's his seventh visit this month. So let me just say this to the President: We get it! You're on the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the time he ended his testimony,&quot; Michael Brown &quot;had added a new bullet point to his resume: Able to process multiple hurtful remarks without crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is now asking people to conserve gasoline. That's going to be tough for a former oilman like Bush. That's like Clinton trying to get women to just say no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure President Bush really understands some of these energy issues. Today, reporters asked him about alternative fuels. He said, 'This is not a gay issue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Roberts was sworn in today as chief justice of the Supreme Court. And they said he might get a license plate for a limo that reads 'Chief Justice One.' It could be made by Tom DeLay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has now introduced a new food pyramid for kids that hopes to teach children how to eat right by using a spaceship computer game.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tom DeLay was indicted, and he was stripped of his congressional leadership powers. When asked what it feels like to lose all his power, DeLay said, 'I feel like a Democrat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Bennett &quot;is in trouble after making racially insensitive remarks. How did a guy this dumb get to be Secretary of Education?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After he was asked to step down, DeLay said, 'I welcome this investigation.' The politicians always say that. Who welcomes an investigation?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Alabama state senator &quot;said he believes the hurricanes that hit New Orleans were sent by God to punish people for sin, gambling and wickedness. That is crazy. God doesn't send hurricanes to punish people. He sends FEMA.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what we know about Harriet Miers: Her name is Harriet Miers. That's all anybody knows about this woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, former Education Secretary Bill Bennett made some insensitive racial comments...and the White House called Bennett's remarks 'not appropriate.' They want to make it clear our government doesn't insult black people. It ignores them, but it doesn't insult them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harriet Miers, as you probably know, has no experience. So apparently, 'no experience' is the main requirement to be a Bush appointee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom DeLay &quot;has received another indictment. This one is for money laundering. Also, he is saying, 'baseless.' He is also saying that indictments 3 through 11, which are coming, are 'without merit and illegitimate.' He feels that indictments 12 through 15, quite frankly, cut a little closer to the bone than he feels comfortable with. 16 through 17 he feels are a farce. 18 to 24 he believes nails it on the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To those critics who are already calling Miers' appointment cronyism, like former FEMA head Mike Brown: Miers' resume doesn't have any Arabian horse associations in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miers &quot;actually gave money to Al Gore's campaign. And she also called President Bush the most brilliant man she's ever met. And this is a woman who we're hiring for her judgment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Republicans are very upset with the choice of this woman because they say it's important to have a staunch conservative on the court because they may have to rule on Tom DeLay's case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While you folks were laughing at that first joke, Tom DeLay was indicted again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two indictments in two weeks for Tom DeLay. That's the kind of thing that could give Congress a bad name.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York &quot;is adding 300 brand new taxi cabs...and a lot of the new cabs will actually have sunroofs. That's pretty deluxe for the cab. It's also for the cab driver to make room for his shoulder-mounted rocket launcher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harriet Miers, who nobody knows anything about. Bush dated her or something. Never really been a judge. Or won something in a bake-off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
