But it's interesting - Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife, says that if Mitt Romney were president now, Vladimir Putin never would have marched into the Ukraine. I'm thinking, whoa, yeah, if there's one thing Putin's afraid of it's Mittie.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to a New York Times report that says 5,000 chemical warheads were found in Iraq in 2003.] &quot;Bush was right. Iraq had WMDs [weapons of mass destruction] the whole time. I feel a combination of two strong emotions - oh, my God, shock and awe! I finally understand what you were talking about sir. I mean, there's no telling what else Bush was right about. I bet some of those weapons were nuclear. This vindication must really warm Dick Cheney's - reactor?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Operation Inherent Resolve' is the name for its fight against ISIS. Unfortunately, two terrorists got away while they were busy thinking of that name.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, some people have said that given how dangerous the mission is, the name doesn't sound as intimidating as it should. But we were actually able to get our hands on a couple of other names that were in the running. I don't think they were that much better. Take a look. There was 'Operation Forceful Talking To.' Then there was 'Operation Cold Shoulder.' Just give 'em the cold?just ignore them. And then finally, we have 'Operation We Can't Even.' And finally, 'Operation ISIS, ISIS Baby.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Dutch motorcycle gang called 'No Surrender' has declared war on ISIS, and they plan to ride motorcycles through Syria and Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, today were the midterm elections. And while we still don't know the official results, the 'Washington Post' is predicting that there is a 98 percent chance of the Republicans taking the Senate. The 'New York Times' said there's a 75 percent chance. And CNN was like, 'Wait, that was today?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that President Obama spent Election Day away from any press coverage, attending closed-door meetings inside the White House. But on the bright side, it's nice to see some doors actually close at the White House. The whole new Secret Service, whole security thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech on Sunday, President Obama said to the crowd, 'We've got to vote. Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.' Which went on for an hour until someone finally fixed the teleprompter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats have been doing everything they can to get young people and college students to vote in the midterms. Though, if you want students to participate in something, maybe don't call them midterms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The midterm elections were held today and so for today only - this is important - for today only, you're a voter and not just a weird old guy hanging around outside a school.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, voted on legalizing marijuana, and if it passes, that means marijuana will be a little harder to get than it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was, of course, Election Day. There were a number of pot-related items on state ballots. Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, voted to legalize recreational marijuana. Vice President Joe Biden celebrated quietly at home, contemplating the infinite nature of the universe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine, Washington, DC - if you thought Congress didn't get a lot of work done before, just wait until they get legal pot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, a measure to legalize medical marijuana did not pass. Which, that's probably for the best, right? People in Florida are weird enough already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remarkably, the very liberal state of California still has not legalized marijuana for recreational use. Though, due to the drought we are having here, we are considering making it legal to drink bong water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know, Republicans picked up a lot of seats and won control of both chambers of Congress yesterday, which is key, because whoever controls Congress controls the lunch menu at the cafeteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans have a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in eight years. I guess when it was all said and done, the Republicans just had the better lawn signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, it was a big night for the Republicans, big night for the conservatives. Rush Limbaugh broke out the OxyContin. ? Even the Washington Redskins are demanding the Democrats change their name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor's race in Florida - very close. They had to wait all night to count the crooked ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new senator from Iowa, Jodi Ernst, says 'We're heading to Washington and we're going to make them squeal.' I said to myself, 'Lady, it's the United States Senate. It's not a bachelor's party.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened today? When is this going to stop? There was another fence-jumper at the White House. Yeah, this time it was Obama trying to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge night for the Republicans across the country. They won everything - the Senate majority, the bigger House majority, tight governor's races, and a giraffe from one of those claw machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news, of course, is the mid-term elections. Last night, Republicans picked up a dozen seats in the House to give them their biggest majority since World War II. Or, as they put it, 'Time to party like it's 1939!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'They also took control of the Senate, after gaining another seven seats. I haven't seen the GOP get this many seats since Chris Christie made an airline reservation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that Republican Scott Brown lost his bid for Senate in New Hampshire last night, two years after he was voted out as senator in Massachusetts. When asked what he was planning to do next, he said, 'Are they still looking for a mayor in Toronto?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Republicans won enough seats to gain a majority in the Senate and increase their majority in the House. For those Democratic candidates who wanted to distance yourselves from Obama, congratulations, you did. You don't ever have to worry about seeing him again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, history was made. For the first time ever, a black, Republican woman has been elected to Congress. President Obama gave her a congratulatory call and told her, 'You're all set. This country never turns against the first black anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Washington, DC, voted to legalize recreational marijuana. President Obama said, 'And after these midterms, thank God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a major repudiation?of the President who, according to reports, spent election night in his sweat pants drowning his sorrows in Pint Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the midterm elections are over, President Obama has invited congressional leaders from both parties to a meeting at the White House tomorrow. When asked if he is nervous, Obama said, 'Oh, I'm not gonna be there. I just invited them. They can figure it out with themselves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'After Michael Jordan recently criticized President Obama's golf game, Obama responded by saying that Jordan should spend more time thinking about his basketball team, the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan was like, 'You really want to talk about whose team got crushed this week?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more political news. On Tuesday, Utah candidate Mia Love, became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress. And this is interesting, she is also a Mormon. A black, female, Republican Mormon. Even unicorns are like, 'Not buying it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a charity benefit last night, somebody paid $300,000 for a guitar lesson, a motorcycle ride and a lasagna dinner at Bruce Springsteen's house. Chris Christie was like, 'Has somebody been reading my dream journal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John Boehner warned?President Obama against using executive action to push through immigration reform, saying, 'When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself.' Which begs the question - when did John Boehner turn into a Bond villain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been announced that a Union soldier who fought at the battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War will be awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama, over 151 years after his death.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I know I've often called President Obama a national embarrassment, but I can't do that tonight, because tonight he's an international embarrassment. This time, in China, where he's attending an economic summit and, once again, he has embarrassed America. First off, he wore traditional Chinese garb, but forgot the Starfleet communicator. Even worse, when he should be over there chewing China out, he was chewing something else [Nicorette gum].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Outrageous! Why are you chewing Nicorette, Mr. President? You're in Beijing - the one place on earth where inhaling burnt tar is the healthy choice. I'm just as offended as the Chinese people. As we all learned in school, if you want to chew gum, you bring enough for everybody - that's 1.3 billion sticks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is over in China right now for the big economic summit in Beijing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'While in Beijing, President Obama announced plans to speak with China's president about human rights, trade and freedom of expression. Or, as it will be broadcast in China, [bleep], trade and the [bleep] of [bleep].&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read a profile in the 'New Republic' that refers to senior White House advisor Valerie Jarrett as 'the Obama whisperer.' ? That's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a summit of world leaders happening in China right now, and President Obama is facing criticism after he was seen chewing gum while walking to the meeting in China. President Bush would have never done that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the results of the midterms elections in various states] &quot;Democrats have lost their farm teams. ?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After a six-year battle, the Senate will vote to begin construction on the Keystone XL pipeline next week, which is an oil pipeline that runs from Canada to the Gulf Coast. They're hoping that the pipe will provide enough oil to cover Kim Kardashian's next photo shoot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Bill Clinton tweeted a photo of himself reading George W. Bush's new book '41.' And then George W. Bush responded to that post on Instagram. And then John McCain said, 'You two are hilarious' by telegraph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are reports that leaders from ISIS and al Qaeda met at a farmhouse in Syria last week and agreed to work together against their common enemy. Two radical terrorist groups managed to do what two American political parties cannot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, the Russian army announced a new plan to modernize most of their weapons over the next six years. Obama was like, 'You said six years? I'll be in Scottsdale, y'all. Take care, I'll be golfing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;]The new] ObamaCare website is better. For example, when you log into the new Healthcare.gov, it offers you a choice of insurance options, rather than brunch options at Denny's in Kalamazoo. Also, the new website loads quickly, whereas the old site would cut the brakes in your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to President Obama's planned executive orders on immigration] &quot;It is well known Barack Obama has been violating the Constitution for years. Well, now he wants to roll it up, stuff it with rice and beans, and top it with picante sauce. ? How dare he take executive action to address immigration, by himself. He should be working with Congress to do nothing together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even worse, the rumor is he's going to overhaul the immigration system through fiat. Fiat? If anything goes wrong - you have to order new parts from Italy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just listen to what's in Obama's plan. It would 'protect up to five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide many of them with work permits.' They get to stay and receive work permits. Now they're coming for the jobs they already have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the whole plan cheapens what it means to be an American, because 'the Department of Homeland Security would take 50 percent off the fee for the first 10,000 applicants.' Fifty percent off. Obama's tossing American citizenship in the bargain bin with the stale Halloween candy and un-bagged underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's going to 'expand visas for foreign-born workers with high-tech skills.' Why foreigners? Americans already have plenty of high-tech skills. Like operating an iPhone to contact a call center in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that yesterday C-SPAN set up a phone line for undocumented immigrants to call in [and] share their perspective on the immigration debate in the US.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama's scheduled to meet with superintendents to discuss his plan to provide students with high-speed Internet in the classroom. And teachers will meet with Obama and say, 'Any other ideas for making my job impossible?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second open-enrollment period for ObamaCare is underway, and it's a lot easier than the last time.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama will announce his new immigration plan. Obama's favorite part of his new immigration plan is that he gets to immigrate to another country, because he's tired of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Analysts say his new immigration plan will focus on deporting violent criminals. Yes, that's good. So, this could impact your fantasy football team.&quot;</SPAN></P>

No, no, this is it - the day we all feared would come, ever since we were told it would come several months ago - has come at last. Because tonight at 8:00 p.m. Mexican Standard Time, Generalissimo Obama announced his unilateral plan to allow four million illegal immigrants to remain in America without fear of deportation. It turns out this whole time we've been building that wall to keep them in.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama gave a primetime speech to announce his plan for immigration reform. People watching TV said the President came off as strong, powerful and decisive. Then they switched from 'Scandal' to see what Obama had to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Obama, I saw that he will travel to Las Vegas tomorrow to speak at the same?high school where he laid out his plan for immigration almost two years ago.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The acting director of the US Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, said that it may make the fence around the White House taller because of all the recent security failures.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, President Obama is giving a major speech on immigration, and the speech will be immediately followed by the Latin Grammys. That's true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Joe Biden's birthday. Happy birthday to the Vice President. The Vice President's friends surprised him with a cake, but his thank you speech was so long, the stripper inside it fell asleep. She's still there now. Her name's Tawny.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House yesterday, they kicked off Computer Science Education Week. Students from a school in Newark were on hand to give tutorials on computer code,&quot; and President Obama &quot;sat down and wrote one. The program he wrote was not very complex. All his program does is draw a box, which he's hoping he can crawl into and hide in for the rest of his term.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big CIA report was released today. It's like 6,700 pages long. It's, by the way, perfect stocking-stuffer for Christmas. Absolutely. But the report does not specifically use the word 'torture.' They're still referring to it as 'a traffic study.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama this week became the first Commander in Chief to write computer code in a bid to encourage computer science lessons across the country. That's really cool. And Joe Biden - which is also cool - became the first Vice President to write 'boobs' on an upside-down calculator. A couple of firsts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 6,000-page report detailing the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques used prior to 2009 was released today. I haven't read it, but I do know that good news rarely takes 6,000 pages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An expected flurry of activity in Congress. Congress agreed to a trillion-dollar spending bill to avoid another government shutdown. It seems like the only time they get anything done in Congress is at the last minute. Maybe we should figure out a way of making it always the last minute. 'You guys have one minute left to live.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker of the House John Boehner said he hopes the bill will pass. This is more than just a bill to him. It's a personal issue, because if the government shuts down again, he will lose the Oompa Loompa who paints his face orange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it doesn't pass, the Federal government will run out of money tomorrow. In the richest country on earth, we will run out of money tomorrow. Maybe we can borrow some money from Mexico to tide us over. A few zillion pesos should get us through to January 1st.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress goes on recess starting tomorrow night. By the way, that's all you need to know about Congress. They get recess. Bunch of middle-aged, adult men and women get three weeks off to play kick ball? That's what you do at recess, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Senate CIA interrogation report] &quot;It turns out this torture activity was going on and George Bush had no idea that this was taking place. The CIA was doing all of this torturing activity, and George Bush - and I thought, now, wait a minute. This doesn't sound like the George Bush I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the Senate CIA interrogation report] &quot;Yes, a damning report about enhanced interrogation. The program was started under President Bush, if you recall. And if you don't recall, the CIA has ways to make you. It's all detailed in this 500-page travesty, which spills sensitive torture secrets and reads like '50 Shades of Legal Grey Areas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big news out of Washington is this report on CIA interrogation techniques. Today, President Obama was talking about the report and praised our country's ability to, quote, 'Face our imperfections, make changes and do better.' Sounds less like a speech on torture and more like the comments on a kindergartner's report card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing but trouble for Obama these days. In fact, according to a new poll, 55 percent of Americans think Republicans focus more on pushing Obama's buttons than actually pursuing their agenda. Then Republicans said, 'Not true. Pushing his buttons is our agenda.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think Republicans focus too much on pushing Obama's buttons. Incidentally, pushing Obama's buttons is also the reason why Biden isn't allowed in the Oval Office anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that many Republicans think that the fact that Chris Christie is still standing strong after his 'Bridgegate' scandal could make him an even better presidential candidate in 2016. That's not surprising. I mean, everyone knows Weebles wobble, but they do not fall down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent interview, Jeb Bush's brother, Neil, said that their mother has come around to the idea of Jeb running for president in 2016. So, if there's anything that says you're qualified to be president, it's your own mom going, 'I guess you could do it. I guess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker wrote a letter this week wishing his constituents a Happy Hanukkah, which is very nice. But he used the term Molotov instead of mazel tov, which is bad. That's not great. You don't have to be Jewish to know that's not great. But he did make up for it, because he told his Jewish constituents he's going to personally light the Macarena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little bit of an embarrassing moment for President Obama. During his speech on immigration yesterday, President Obama quoted a verse from the Bible that doesn't exist. Yeah, apparently Jesus never said, 'I'm all about that bass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney - have you heard him talking about the CIA torture report? He says the torture report is 'full of crap.' That's good enough for me. He's a regular Churchill, isn't he, that Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that this week's Senate report on the CIA's interrogation techniques suggested that George Bush and Dick Cheney did not know the location of the detention facility. Then Cheney was like, 'Part of the thrill was finding them on my own.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. George Bush and Dick Cheney may not have known the location of the detention facilities. Though in fairness, it took Bush three years to figure out the location of the White House. 'Is it Washington state? Pennsylvania Avenue? It's very confusing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress managed to avoid another government shutdown by agreeing on a $1.1 trillion spending bill. Of course, to get anything passed in this environment, they had to do a lot of compromising. I'll show you what I mean in tonight's edition of 'Split the Diff.' Take a look at this first compromise. The Democrats wanted more funding for school lunches. The Republicans wanted more immigrants deported to Mexico. So they compromised. Now immigrants being deported will receive school lunch on the way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans wanted to expand gun rights. The Democrats wanted to expand animal rights. So their compromise is to give guns to bears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, the Democrats wanted to protect all the national parks. The Republicans wanted to protect the rights of senior citizens. They compromised, and now Larry King has to be forced to live in the forest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news this week has been the Senate's recent report on torture. In response to the Senate's recent report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, former Vice President Dick Cheney said, 'I'd do it again in a minute.' I'm sorry - I misread that. He said, 'I'm doing it again in a minute.' Then he checked his watch and left the room. 'I gotta go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney attacked critics of the CIA's interrogation techniques, saying, 'What are we supposed to do? Kiss them on both cheeks and say, 'Please, please tell us what you know?&quot; Though to be fair, getting kissed by Dick Cheney is also banned by the Geneva Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seth Meyers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Texas Governor Rick Perry said this week that running for president 'is not an IQ test.' It 'is not an IQ test.' He says he knows that because he once took an IQ test and it came back negative&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department ruled that Native American tribes are allowed to grow and sell marijuana on reservations. Grow and sell marijuana. This decision was hailed as a victory by Native American leader Giggling Eagle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures] &quot;They say the White House is debating whether or not to publicly accuse North Korea. The Justice Department is expected to make a statement about this tomorrow. It could be deemed an act of war. Could you imagine if we wind up in a war because of the guys from 'Pineapple Express'?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it seems like Jeb Bush will be running for president. And I'm telling you, you can feel the monotony, honestly. Cut it with a knife.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House announced today plans to begin normalizing relations with Cuba. This as we're awkwardizing relations with Russia. If you told me in the 1980s that this would happen, I would have said, 'I don't care, have you got any cocaine?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news out of Washington today - President Obama announced that the US is working to improve its relationship with Cuba in an effort to normalize full diplomatic relationships. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read that despite Russia's move to raise interest rates this week, the value of the ruble has continued to crash. And then Putin was like, 'Whew, good thing I put all my money in Beanie Babies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, President Obama said that he recently deejayed a small dance party at the White House. Obama has a lot in common with deejays. He takes requests and then completely ignores them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't pretend to understand the nuances of this diplomatic relationship thing, but there was a prisoner swap between the US and Cuba. We get a man named Alan Gross, who has been in prison for five years, and Cuba gets Eva Mendez.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans are upset about this. But the Republicans and Cuba have something in common. They both believe it's still 1955.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Jeb Bush?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to Sony's decision to pull &quot;The Interview&quot; movie after threats made by a group of hackers] &quot;Seems like everyone's weighing in on the movie's cancellation. Mitt Romney suggested that the film should be released online for free. Donald Trump says, 'The studio has no courage or guts.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After President Obama announced the US will work to restore its relationship with Cuba, the shares of big cruise line companies increased. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, President Obama revealed that his favorite movie of this year was 'Boyhood'. Makes sense. If there's one thing Obama can identify with, it's aging several years over the course of a couple hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
