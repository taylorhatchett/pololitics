<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;People are calling this the closest presidential race in 40 years. . Man, I tell you, this race is tighter than Al Gore's pants on the cover of 'Rolling Stone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know that story by now. This is so stupid. Apparently, Al Gore's pants had to be airbrushed. This is true. You see the current edition of 'Rolling Stone' where he's standing like this. They had to airbrush this area because they said he appeared to be aroused. So apparently, it sounds like Al's been stretching a lot more than the truth lately.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore says he's going to spend these next two weeks -- the two final weeks of the election -- having kitchen table discussions with different families all around the country. He wants to travel around the country, drop into people's homes at dinnertime and talk with them about the issues. Well, you thought people hated trick-or-treaters. 'Shut out the lights! It's Gore, he's coming!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Wouldn't that drive you nuts? You get home from a long day at work, 'Honey, pass the potatoes.' 'Under my plan, the potatoes would be over here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Those close to the president say that President Clinton is worried. Clinton is worried secretly they might lose the White House in November, because they could lose. And Clinton's very upset about it because, you know, Gore promised him, if he won, he'd still let Clinton use that little private study off the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, the Bush family -- George W. Bush, Barbara -- they say they may be descendants of the royal family. Have you ever heard this? Because the Bush family goes back to England, and they think they might be long-lost cousins to the royal family. And when reached for comment today, Queen Elizabeth said she found that unbelievab-ab-ab- able.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a quick costume idea (for Halloween). This is kind of interesting. Pretty easy to go as George W. Bush. What you do is you get a dark suit, a red tie, and then sniff glue until you get that glazed look in your eyes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Or you can go as Al Gore. Just shove a cucumber down your pants and wear a lot of makeup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, that's the big story. The cover of Rolling Stone magazine has Al Gore on it. And they're saying that the cover had to be retouched because it looked as if he was aroused in the photograph. He was standing there, and he appeared to be aroused. Well, that Tipper must be one hell of a kisser, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some good has come out of it. Today, Al Gore was named spokesman for Banana Republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Bush is still ahead in the polls. . Today, Gore told reporters that his momentum is increasing, which tends to happen when you're going downhill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Democrats now are urging Al Gore to call on President Clinton for help. But Gore doesn't want to do this. He doesn't want to go to Clinton because he wants to prove to everybody he can be the comeback kid, which -- I think he already is the comeback kid. Did you ever hear one of his speeches? Every time he starts talking, he has to yell to the audience, 'Come back! Come back! I'm -- Stop! It's the 1%.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, with Bush leading in the polls, you know who has to be the most upset about this? Dan Quayle. Because he's got to be thinking, 'Hey, I did stupid stuff. I screwed up words, I couldn't remember anything. Where were you people when I was running?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This week, New York Governor George Pataki signed a law making sodomy legal in New York State. Well, it's about time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, I got to hand it to him. That is not an easy law to get passed. He had to get behind it and push it through, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Pretty slow news day. The candidates aren't doing anything. Where's Clinton? We need a good sex scandal, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A Delta flight that landed in Boston this morning was quarantined by health officials after one of the passengers on board started bleeding from the eyes. Turns out he was just looking at an issue of Penthouse with Paula Jones in it, so it's nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, now she's naked in the new issue of Pentouse. And I understand they had to airbrush some of them. Well, they didn't airbrush them.  Actually, they had to use a caulking gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it was 118 years ago this week, Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb. President Clinton honored the occasion the way he usually does, with a three-way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton has signed a new bill, a tough drunk driving law, much tougher than the existing one. And today, George W. Bush called it a political ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nickelodeon did a survey asking kids who they would vote for President. You know who won? George Bush won 55% to 45%. Well, if you were a kid, wouldn't it be cool to be smarter than the President? Duh!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And potential First Lady Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, you know, Dick Cheney's wife, the vice president's candidate, ended their 'W. Stands for Women' tour yesterday. They've been touring a bus -- this bus all around the country for over a week courting women voters, saying that the W. in George W. Bush's name stands for 'women,' as opposed to back in the '70s, when it just stood for 'wasted.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kind of embarrassing -- on a recent campaign rally, Al Gore's daughter Kristen mistakenly referred to Seattle as the capital of Washington. Yeah, it's Olympia. But she said it was Seattle, and that was kind of embarrassing. Boy, Bush was all over this. He said, 'Even I'm not that bad with geometry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, some problems for Bush this week. Today, researchers at a California think tank questioned Bush's numbers about state test scores - - the test scores in Texas. They've been talking about that. And Bush lashed out at them. He said he's never trusted think tanks. You can't blame him. Remember a couple of years ago, Bush went into that think tank? Almost drowned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you seen that cover of Rolling Stone magazine with Al Gore on it? The one that had to be retouched? Al kind of looks like Al 'Johnny Wad' Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they had to retouch it. It's Al 'The Package' Gore, they're calling him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in the Massachusetts Senate race.Ted Kennedy refusing to debate his opponent. I hate to say it, but I think Ted's getting a big head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And aviation officials investigating why a light plane violated White House air space. Flew right over the White House yesterday. You see that? They're investigating it. Apparently, in addition to allowing people to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom, the Clintons are now offering direct flights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And with Halloween right around the corner, Paula Jones is naked in the December issue of Penthouse magazine. If you have not seen this issue, just picture Yasser Arafat with breasts, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Larry King asked Paula Jones last night why she posed nude after she said she never would, and she said 'A woman has a right to change her mind.' Which is good news for Clinton, maybe he still has a shot, huh? 'Get on the phone. Get on the phone. Call her up. Sure. Give it a shot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nickelodeon did a survey asking kids who they would vote for President, and they picked Bush over Gore. But see, like real voters, there was a gender gap. The boys tended to vote for Bush because he once owned a sports team. That's kind of cool. And the girls tended to pick Gore because he liked to play with makeup.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it seems as though our Vice President who invented the Internet is at it again. You know, this morning, Gore caught in another exaggeration. Today Gore claims he was the guy 'who let the dogs out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Queen Latifah has invited Al Gore on her show. I think he taped it already. Al Gore not only appeared on Queen Latifah's show, he used his rap name, 'Stiff Daddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Out on the campaign trail today, Al Gore said he will find some way for gay couples to live together in some kind of recognized relationship but without actually having them sign a marriage contract with their lover. And now straight guys are going, 'Hey, why can't we get that deal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And this week, George W. Bush was criticized for claiming that Texas school kids have been getting higher test scores when compared with the period before he was governor. Today, Bush clarified the position. He said, 'Well, they are higher test scores when you compare them to my test scores.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see who was on stage at Hillary's birthday party in New York? Robert de Niro and Bill Clinton, two of the greatest actors of our time, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton actually sang 'Happy Birthday' to Hillary from the stage. You know, he was a little nervous. He was not nervous to sing in front of those people. He was afraid he might accidentally yell out the wrong name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think he gave her a copy of 'Leaves of Grass.' The Walt Whitman book. Beautiful copy. How did he think of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you, though, she looked great on TV. Did you see her at the party? Looked very pretty. In fact, when Clinton saw how well she blew out all the candles, he invited her back to his room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the British tabloids, under his prenuptial agreement, if Michael Douglas.ever cheats on Catherine Zeta Jones, it will cost him $7.5 million. . In fact, Clinton has a similar deal with Hillary.  In fact, Clinton finally arranged for his bank to do direct deposits every month. It's easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you really want to scare Al Gore this Halloween? Dress up as Ralph Nader. Whoo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Or if you want to go out as George W. Bush -- very simple -- fill your mouth with peanut butter and try to say 'subliminal.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, well, no Halloween costume is going to scare me. I've seen those naked pictures of Paula Jones. I'm immune now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other night in New York City, Hillary Clinton celebrated her 53rd birthday with a huge party. Big event, a lot of celebrities. Also a fundraiser. In fact, President Clinton told the crowd, this is the quote, this is the exact quote President Clinton said, he said, 'She looks pretty good for 53 years old.' That's what he said. 'Looks pretty good.' Probably not good enough for him to have sex with, but still...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a new national movement by single people who are complaining that all of Gore and Bush's promises are targeting families and children. . See, this is why Clinton struck the perfect balance as a politician. He was a married guy who acted like he was single.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And on Queen Latifah's show yesterday.Al Gore was on. She asked about his favorite shows. Al Gore said he liked to watch HBO's 'The Sopranos. ' Yeah, kind of interesting. And Bush said he's never seen 'The Sopranos,' but he enjoys whacking guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You wanna scare Al Gore? Put on a Bill Clinton mask and start telling voters what a good friend you are.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;My doorbell rings, I answer it. A kid's there wearing a white sheet with two holes cut out for the eyes. I said, 'Hey, hey, a little early for Halloween,' and the kid says, 'No, no, I'm a Pat Buchanan campaign worker. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The candidates have very different views on Halloween. Al Gore wants to take all the candy and put it in a lock-box, while George W. Bush wants to give half of it back to the rich kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush has received some unlikely support from the niece of Martin Luther King Jr. It's all part of the new grassroots group: African American for Bush. African American, singular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore is hitting the campaign trail hard, speaking in Michigan, and traveling next to Wisconsin, and on to California. George W. Bush is taking his campaign to France, Canada, and a town he invented called El Guacamole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Vice President Gore gave me a good Halloween tip today. This is pretty good. When you go trick-or-treating, try to focus on the wealthiest 1%. They have the best candy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We have a guy on the show tonight who will most definitely be President in January -- Martin Sheen is here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it looks as if President Clinton is going to begin campaigning for Vice President Gore this week. Well, as you know -- hey, that's fair. For the last six months, Ralph Nader's been campaigning on Bush's behalf. So I think that it's only fair that they go out and one side help the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore has renewed his call for creating alternate fuel cars that run on something called biomass. Have you heard about this? Biomass -- a mixture of manure and other stuff. Well, you thought you hated getting stuck behind a bus before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And last night, we had George W. Bush on this show. He seemed pretty confident, didn't he? Very confident. In fact, I think he's already writing his inaugurigigal speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All the networks have their maps to predict the election results.  You got the George W. Bush states, those are the ones that are for Bush. Then they show the Al Gore states, and those are the ones that will go for Al Gore. Then they have what they call the Anne Heche states. These can go either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Secret Service took an unarmed man into custody on the White House grounds the other day. You see this guy? Jumped over the northwest gates. And they grabbed him on the lawn. Police bail was set at $100,000. For half that, he could have stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom. It was ridiculous. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You all heard about this controversial interview with President Clinton that's in Esquire. This is causing a lot of -- well, Clinton is very upset with the magazine. He said they released the interview early. It wasn't supposed to come out after the election. In a related story, Penthouse released those Paula Jones nude photos -- they released those early, too. Apparently, those weren't supposed to come out until hell froze over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If talks between the US and North Korea go well this week, there's talk that President Clinton may actually visit North Korea. May go to North Korea. I think pretty safe bet Buddy the dog won't be going on that trip, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;20 journalists surprised George W. Bush by wearing George W.  Bush masks. Yes, they did. And after seeing them, a confused George W. said, 'Wait a minute, which one is me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Some Democrats have been asking Ralph Nader to stop campaigning for President because they think he's hurting Al Gore's chances. That's right. Meanwhile, the rest of the Democratic Party has been asking Al Gore to stop campaigning because they think he's hurting Al Gore's chances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent interview, President Clinton said that the Republicans should apologize for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. That's what he said. That's right, yeah, it's all part of an interview that appears in this month's 'Lost Touch with Reality' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Because it is Halloween, Texas Governor George W. Bush presided over and execution dressed as the Grim Reaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight, Hillary Clinton went out dressed as a New Yorker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton is in the Halloween spirit. Right now down in Washington he is helping an intern out of her costume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;One of the deciding factors for many swing voters is how the election could shape the future of the Supreme Court. . While Gore says he would appoint progressive liberal judges, George W. Bush says he would appoint Judge Judy and Judge Reinhold.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I like it when people put effort into scaring the trick-or- treaters. Instead of just handing out candy, it's fun when you can scare them.  Like Paula Jones: She was answering the door nude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Because it's an election year, a lot of people dressed up as Al Gore and George Bush. . Actually, more people dressed up as George Bush. Not for political reasons, just a lot of kids can't afford all the makeup it takes to become Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, you know what George Bush's favorite candy is? He likes those pixie sticks with the powder inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Just six days to go. You think prisoners on death row in Texas are rooting for George Bush? Sure they are. If he loses and comes back in a bad mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Martin Sheen was out campaigning last night with Gore. He was on the show last night with Gore. And Martin Sheen went to Westwood to do a rally with him. Which is bizarre, I mean, Al Gore will campaign with the guy who plays the President on TV, but he won't campaign with the real President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Charlie Sheen, on the other hand -- he strikes me as a Bush man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We had Al Gore on the show last night. Very nice man. But something odd -- you know, he likes to take credit sometimes, he likes to exaggerate a little. Well, I was watching the end of the show. Ellen, run the end of the show. Look, see - 'Directed by Al Gore.' You see what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But it's still too close to call. Except for Pat Buchanan. Why is this guy in the race? You know what his numbers are? 1%. Even milk gets up to 2%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Got any Ralph Nader supporters here? How much money has he raised, $10 million, $14 million? Can't the man buy a new suit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, the Secret Service arrested a guy who jumped the fence at the White House. Climbed a 14-foot fence, jumped off. Luckily, because of the White House, he landed on a big pile of soft money. So he wasn't injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today is the 200th anniversary of the White House. 200 years ago today. Before the White House was built, people who donated money to the President had to sleep in their own bedroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to some political experts, George W. Bush could win 30 states. He could win 30 states, but still lose the election. That's what they're saying. That's true. And after hearing this, George W. said, 'Well, what happens if I win 40 states and he only wins 20?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They caught a guy trying to hop over the White House fence. . Listen to me. I know you're eager. I know you're anxious, but you're just going to have to wait until Wednesday, Governor Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The only guy sneaking into the White House these days is President Clinton, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's a dead heat, it's neck and neck, but experts believe that George W. Bush will probably be president. . And they're so certain he is going to win, they're already printing up the easy-to-read nuclear strike codes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Your pundits, your experts are saying it all could come down to Florida. They're saying it all could come down to Florida. Florida is like Anne Heche. It could go either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Apparently, Clinton's feelings are hurt because Gore doesn't want him out there campaigning. Yeah, it's hard to imagine you wouldn't want anyone out there campaigning for you who's been impeached, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;All week long here at 'The Late Show' we're running a deal. We're selling out all our old Clinton jokes. . Listen to this inventory.  We have 7,500 President Clinton jokes, all of which end in the word intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Ralph Nader still refusing to drop out of the presidential race. He says it is not enough for people to vote for the lesser of two evils, they should vote for the lesser of three evils.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore running around the country during this last week of the campaign. Asking people, 'Are you better off now than you were eight years ago?' To which Clinton's going, 'Not me, I'm still married.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore has published a new book, which just came out today, called 'Bringing Prosperity Home.' It's 153 pages. Well, I'm going to try and read that before Tuesday. Imagine Al Gore in book form, how boring is that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What did I read today? Major shift in the Democratic party today.  They changed their position on the death penalty. You see that? Now they want to kill Ralph Nader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And on the show Hardball, with Chris Matthews -- Ralph Nader was on that today -- came out in favor of legalizing drugs. Nader said, 'We should legalize drugs,' and now George Bush says, 'Hey, I'm voting for Nader, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Before he leaves office, President Clinton says he might visit North Korea. It won't be an official state visit. Apparently, that country is one of the few he needs to complete his 'panties from around the world' collection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton says in this month's Esquire -- this is a very controversial interview -- he says he wants the Republicans who spoke against him during impeachment to apologize to him. He says he was insulted, he wants the Republicans to apologize to him. The Republicans said today, those were oral insults, and under Clinton's logic, an oral insult is not really an insult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Joe Lieberman -- true story -- surprised his mom by showing up at her birthday party in Florida. Isn't that sweet? I thought that was sweet. It's nice. Meanwhile, George W. Bush surprised his mom by spelling Mississippi correctly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a brand-new interview -- I think this interview is, like, from yesterday -- Barbra Streisand says that she would have taken Bill Clinton back after his affair with Monica Lewinsky just like Hillary did. That's what she said. Yeah. And after hearing this, Hillary thanked Streisand for her support and then had sex with James Brolin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Ross Perot appeared on Larry King' tonight and announced who he's endorsing for President. Isn't that exciting? And not surprisingly, Perot endorsed Twilow from the planet Nebular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They're calling Gore now, a liar. They're calling Bush a dumb guy. And I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute, why can't we get one candidate who's both a dumb guy and a liar?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Gore can't get any momentum going here in the last days of the campaign. Bush, actually, is a nine-point favorite among death row inmates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They say this thing is neck-and-neck. It's going right down to the wire. Earlier today, Gore was endorsed by Ben and Bush was endorsed by Jerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Senate race here in New York, Hillary Clinton is very, very confident. She's so confident she's no longer pretending that he likes it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is an historical day. 201 years ago, the cornerstone was laid in Washington for the White House. That's right. 201 years ago they laid the cornerstone for the White House. Go ahead and make up your own Bill Clinton joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe those winds today? Gusts to 70 miles an hour.  In fact, winds were so high, almost blew George Bush's car back on the road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see what's new with George Anheuser-Busch, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. The man who put the party back in Republican Party, yeah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you know what 'W.' stands for? 'Where is my car?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess George Bush called a press conference yesterday to admit he was charged with drunk driving after a Labor Day party in Maine back in 1976. He was fined $150. And of course, his handlers, they tried to put a good spin on it. Today they said he was proud to be drinking a domestic beer in an American car on an American day honoring the American laborer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They had the police officer on the news today who arrested him. He said Bush was conservative, very polite, gave no resistance. Sure, Bush was just happy the guy didn't find the cocaine under the seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;His sister was with him in the car. Some people think this will hurt him in the polls. Not because he was arrested, but because he was out drinking with his sister. Who does that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno : &quot;You've heard of Reagan Democrats? He's a Ted Kennedy Republican. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He did say in his defense, he has never been drunk enough to hit on Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, he did pay his debt to society. He was fined $150 and then released. So much for the justice system being easy on rich white kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;When reporters asked bush today why he waited so long to come forward about it, he said he was going to write up a press release earlier this year but couldn't spell 'DUI.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It came out today at his vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, has had not one but two drunk driving arrests. Cheney has two. Bush calls him 'Showoff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We got 'Drunk' and 'Drunker' running here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I say we vote for Bush and Cheney just to get them off the damn highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But Al Gore's campaign denied having anything to do with releasing the story to the press. They have no idea the news came out. They were shocked. They were shocked. Didn't know anything. Isn't that kind of suspicious? The first time in history Al Gore hasn't taken credit for something. Isn't that amazing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And another scandal today. You hear about this? It seems back in 1985 Ralph Nader once pulled out of his driveway without putting his seat belt on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ross Perot endorsed George W. Bush last night. Perot came out for Bush. You know Perot also had a drinking problem. He can't reach the water fountain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There was another one of those stupid high-speed freeway chases here in LA last night. It was on all the newscasts for hours. That's all they cover here. This one didn't even involve the police. The cops weren't involved. Turns out, it was just Al Gore trying to distance himself from Clinton who was in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Clinton is not campaigning for Gore in California, but he is in Arkansas. Clinton is going to Arkansas Sunday to campaign for Gore. In fact, I understand Arkansas state troopers started already started rounding up really ugly women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, of course, on the campaign trail, it was revealed that in 1976, George W. Bush was arrested for drunk driving. That's what we heard about, yeah. Oohs that's right, yeah. And according -- this is true. They're telling us more now. According to reports, the arresting officer became suspicious when he noticed George W. wasn't slurring his words. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, the movie is based on the TV show, Charlie's Angels, which premiered in 1976. 1976. It's amazing that people still care about something that happened, what, 24 years ago. And today, George Bush said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, one more day. One more day and Al Gore can finally take that makeup off, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow's the big day. What, every four years, we remove one President and install another. It's kind of like changing the kitty litter, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush told Fox News he is very confident. He says he's going to win California. Well, that.that could just be the whiskey talking, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I saw him on the news doing this, flashing the V sign. Oh, not 'Victory' - 'two more beers. Me and Cheney, set them up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, he admitted to being arrested for drunk driving in 1976. But he said today he is relieved that the whole DUI incident has become known because it's, 'You know, maybe they'll get off my back about the cocaine thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the officer who arrested Bush is now retired. He was on the news the other night, and he said that when he arrested Bush, he was slurring his words, he was incoherent, and he wasn't making any sense. That doesn't mean he was drunk, he's like that all the time. You know, this could be a bum rap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it turns out Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, had two drunk driving arrests in his past. That's why he picked him. Not a running mate, he's a drinking buddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know the Democrats are behind this. They were sneaky. What a nasty business this is. . Well, now the Democrats -- you see the scandal they pulled out about Ralph Nader today? Did you hear about this? This is unbelievable. The Democrats' -- well, they want -- the Democrats' fingerprints are on it. But it turns out, back in the mid-70s, Ralph Nader once took a cold medicine then operated heavy machinery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Public records show that dead people regularly vote in Georgia elections. People who have been dead for years -- turned up in the voting booth. Again, Bush's worst nightmare -- executes the guy, comes back and votes again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's take a look at the lesser of two weasels, because that's who we're voting for here. You're voting for the lesser of two weasels, basically. You got one who accepts illegal campaign contributions from foreign governments. You got the other one who drives drunk. That's what it comes down to. That's between Gore and Bush right there. You see, Gore pleads the fifth, Bush drinks a fifth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You still got to feel sorry for the loser because that's a bad loss. Isn't it? I mean, look what happened to Bob Dole. One day, he was almost president of the US. The next day, he has erectile dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, that shows you, though, how science can literally change the course of the world. I mean, four years ago, if Bob Dole was taking Viagra, and Bill Clinton was taking saltpeter, none of this ever would have happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like President Clinton will visit North Korea. Not for diplomatic reasons, it's the only place he can find politicians who will be seen with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is the last day of the presidential race. Or, as George W. Bush calls it, 'last call.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush is so confident he's already hired a designated driver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We could be about to elect someone who has a DUI. And I'm thinking, 'Maybe we should take another look at Ted Kennedy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore says the race is a battle between good and evil. Thank you, Superman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton doesn't care. He's down in DC, now having sex with the door open.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I had a horrible nightmare last night. Oh, man, what a nightmare. I dreamed these aliens from outer space landed -- and they said to me, 'Take us to your leader,' and I didn't know what to do!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, welcome to the Tonight Show, now 100% candidate-free. Whoo! Don't have to talk to those people for four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I want to say congratulations to -- whoever, we don't know! What is going on down there in the banana republic of Florida, huh? Can't they get their elections straight? Yeah! Send Carter down to supervise that thing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Who's running it -- what do they got, Don King running the election down there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, Florida hasn't been this nervous since OJ moved there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What an election night that was last night. It had something for everybody, you know? First Gore won, oh, then Bush won for a while. Oh, and then Gore won for awhile. Oh, then Bush had a good time. God, Florida's not just God's waiting room anymore, you know? Even God's going, 'Come on, who won?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's so funny? The whole year we made fun of undecided voters, and they were right, it's undecided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why does it take so long to find out who the president's going to be? Now they're talking tomorrow. I mean, it only takes two hours to pick a Miss America, and there are 50 of those candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Wouldn't it be great if this whole thing would be decided by Elian Gonzalez' crazy relatives, huh? Uncle Lazaro and the crazy fisherman - 'We got the final vote right here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I'll tell you something, it's starting to affect world politics. The rest of the world was getting nervous. Like, today, the Chinese said, 'We don't know who to write our checks to. What are we doing? Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I guess it looks like Al Gore will win the popular vote by nearly 200,000 votes. But right now, if current projections are accurate, it looks like George Bush will become President. So the guy who actually got the fewer votes wins. Isn't that what Slobodan Milosevic tried to do in Yugoslavia?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you know it doesn't matter how many popular votes you get, because this whole thing comes down to the Electoral College, which has got to make Bush a little nervous. Because, you know, college was never his strong point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm not saying Bush is getting confident that he's going to win, but today, he spent all day trying to pronounce inaugur-ra-al.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, today was a rough day for Bush, not knowing. Although yesterday was even rougher for him, because, you know, being election day, the bars are closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess Governor Bush began the day today with a morning jog.  He didn't do it for exercise. He had to run because, you know, the police took his car away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney -- he has two drunk driving arrests in his past. See, that's why Bush chose him -- a guy with more experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And man, do you feel the hot shot news guys going back and forth? What do they call, 'Florida for Gore -- oh, and then Bush.' And then they have to pull that back. Man, I haven't seen that much indecision since Anne Heche took her boyfriend to see 'Charlie's Angels.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I loved watching the news last night because around 8:00, 9:00, Dan Rather and Jennings and Brokaw -- they all looked great. They're all dapper and neat, you know. They got the tie, the crest, the makeup, the blow dryer. They're talking perfectly into the camera. At about 4:00 AM, Brokaw's starting to look like Joe Cocker, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what we should do? We should make them share the Oval Office. That sounds like a bad sitcom, 'My Two Presidents' on NBC, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, like Gore could do it Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Bush could do it, what, Thursdays, Sundays and Saturdays. And then -- no, Sunday you bring in a temp, like Hillary. I think she's been looking for a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, Clinton spoke out. He said, 'Look, it's obvious that people can't decide, I'll just stay four more years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So I guess you know Hillary got elected. Hillary going to Washington. And of course -- yep, yep. Hillary on her way to Washington. And of course, Bill is ecstatic because, you know, he's leaving Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And at the polling place in New York, where they voted, President Clinton told the reporters that he would be happy 'Doing whatever I do after the new President takes over.' I think most guys would be happy doing whatever Clinton does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in Missouri, the Governor who passed away was elected to the Senate. That's another odd story. They're saying the first time a dead man has ever been elected to the Senate, but I think Strom Thurmond holds that record, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, the big match is for Hollywood -- you can go back to sex and violence, the coast is clear again. Whoo! Thank God that election's over with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a very odd story. A company is now coming out with a chastity belt for men. Chastity belt -- what good is that going to do us now? Clinton's only got two months left. Where were these people eight years ago? That's when you need them. That's when you need them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The outcome of the presidential election still has not been determined, and now, apparently, it all comes down to how the Floridians voted. That's what they're saying, yeah. And after hearing this, George W. Bush said, 'Please, let's not bring foreigners into this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Experts say there hasn't been this much head-to-head competition in Florida since 'Murder She Wrote' went up against 'Matlock.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;After President Clinton cast his ballot in New York, where he voted, right after he cast his ballot, he took a picture with four women wearing Hillary Clinton masks. That's true. That's right, yeah. And the women said the reason they put the Hillary masks on was because that way, the President wouldn't hit on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Y'all heard about this -- is that late, late last night, Al Gore called George W. Bush and conceded that Bush won the presidency. Then Gore called back and hour later and retracted his concession. That's true. That's right. I don't know if you heard about this. But then, Gore called back ten more times and asked if 'Dick Hertz' was there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush is not president of the United States. Al W. Gore is not president of the United States. What do you say we just leave it that way?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier today down in Austin, George W. Bush held a press conference and demanded a refill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, very nervous about to whole thing. He was up all night waiting for that call. Now he knows how those death row inmates feel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore, bless his heart, voted the same way he does every election. He went into the voting booth, closed the curtain and made out with Tipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The recount is underway in Florida and the Republican Party has hired OJ to hide the ballot boxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How about Hillary Clinton? . They're saying already that maybe in 2004 she might run for president. If you look at it in those terms, becoming the senator from New York is the first step in the Clinton's becoming a two impeachment family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They are saying Hillary has her eyes on the Oval Office for 2004 and I am thinking, 'Well it's too bad she didn't have her eyes on the Oval Office when Bill was nailing Monica.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Folks, bear with me for just a moment. We're going to start the monologue in just a moment. We have to wait until the rest of the jokes come in from Florida, so it shouldn't be much longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Historians are saying this is the closest election, well, I guess since Greg and Marcia Brady ran against each other for student council, remember that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Voter irregularities being reported down there in Florida. You hear the latest? Orlando now, now the Seven Dwarfs are claiming they couldn't reach the ballot box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, doctors say there's a -- I guess there's a condition for what the country is going through. They're calling it 'electile dysfunction.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's really getting embarrassing. In fact, today, a boatload of Florida residents in search of democracy washed up in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's like the whole country has gone insane. How stupid is this? You know, this country -- we used to fight wars, we used to cure disease, we used to send men to the moon. Now we can't punch a hole in a piece of paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How do you do that? You can't read the arrow? It's got your guy's name and the arrow, you can't follow that along? People used to be ashamed to be stupid. Now it gets you on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see the ballot? How hard -- it can't be any harder than bingo. That's what those people do down there, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is the actual ballot. Okay, everyone's talking about the holes not lined up. You know, there's a name -- look at this name in the corner. This is an actual person running. Monica Moorehead. Is that some kind of Clinton write-in girlfriend vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The last time George W. Bush was in a recount like this I guess was back in '73 when he said to a guy, 'Hey, that doesn't look like ten grams of coke to me, let's count it again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush not in a good mood right now. You see what he said today from Austin? He said if we don't get the results soon, he's going to start executing one prisoner every hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Al Gore's Vice Presidential running mate was named Joe Lieberman. You know, he also ran for the Senate in Connecticut, and he won his seat again. Or as he calls it, 'Plan B.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see President Clinton got kind of misty-eyed while Hillary was giving her speech? Well, sure. I mean, Clinton's wife is a senator, Monica Lewinsky's a millionaire, Paula Jones in 'Penthouse.' All the girls are doing so good. Got to be so proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, in Washington, President Clinton met with Yasser Arafat. That's true. All right. Nice. Yeah, Arafat said he plans on returning to the Middle East as soon as possible, because right now, things are too chaotic here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Gore supporters in Florida claim that they accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan. That's right, yeah. In fact, some of the older voters were so confused, they thought they were voting for President James Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that the television ratings on election night were the highest in 40 years. Can you believe that? It's amazing. That's right, yeah. The networks are thrilled, and as a result they promise to incorrectly call the election from now on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore's campaign manager is now asking -- this is the story as of a couple of hours ago -- he's now asking for the ballots in four Florida districts to be counted by hand. That's what they're saying. Yeah, and George W. Bush said, 'Well, that'll never work. What happens when you run out of fingers? I'm confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's a big night for us, ladies and gentlemen. The entire balcony tonight is filled with confused Palm Beach voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I got a call today from my mom. She's all upset. She accidentally voted for Pat Sajak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Some Palm Beach voters were confused and they were having trouble distinguishing between Al Gore and Pat Buchanan. They also have trouble distinguishing between 'drive' and 'reverse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the recount? They say now, that the recount should be finished by Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;According to the recount, George W. Bush is ahead by about only 400 or 500 votes. . I bet he's not having trouble with that fuzzy math now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Both candidates are in seclusion right now, and they're not making any public appearances and not saying anything. So you see, some good has come of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, he just don't care. . The way he looks at it, it gives him time to sober up before his victory speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Ways the United States Would Be Different Without A President: 10. Supreme Court justice selected by being 100th caller to Z- 100 9. 'Hail to the Chief' only played for winner of Pillsbury Bake-off 8. Instead of going to Iowa and New Hampshire every four years, no one would go to Iowa and New Hampshire ever 7. With no presidential fitness test, kids would be even fatter and lazier 6. White House interns would be reduced to having sex with each other 5. More time on news for banter between anchor and fat weatherman 4. The position of vice president would be even more insignificant 3. Entire country would operate as inefficiently as the state of Florida 2. Only her friends, family and an occasional guy from T.G.I. Friday's would know the name 'Monica Lewinsky' 1. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would be the grandest Blockbuster Video ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There is controversy over the double-punched ballots in Florida and election officials became concerned that old people were punching too many holes in the ballots when they heard the people shout 'bingo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The recount of votes in Florida continues with George W. Bush's lead over Al Gore narrowing to less than 300 votes and now it could end up being handled by the courts. You want to clear this up quick? Throw in a couple thousand lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There are reports that 3,000 senior citizens may have actually voted for Pat Buchanan due to the layout of some ballots. Yes, our next president could be elected by folks who couldn't figure out how to punch holes in cardboard, or as George W. Bush calls them, 'my people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember that 50-year-old guy that got the world's first hand transplant about a year ago. Remember the story? The guy got a hand transplant. Now he wants doctors to amputate it, because he says the hand has rejected him. This is true. No, I'm not making this up. He said it's not his hand, and he has no control over what it does. And he wants the hand taken off. Isn't this amazing? In fact he said on Tuesday, he wanted to vote for Gore, but the hand went for Buchanan!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, it's hard to believe, just four years ago, Russia was the country with the failing stock market, the illegal elections and the drunken president, huh? Gosh, hard to believe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe how long this thing is going on? Now they're talking about this big legal court battle thing. Do you realize before this is over, Gore and Bush, they could be retired and living in Florida?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you, I haven't seen such voting irregularities since Kathie Lee Gifford won the People's Choice award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And those folks in Florida, whew, they're hopping mad. I haven't seen people in Florida this mad since Metamucil switched to the childproof cap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's just getting so stupid. In fact, now Bob Dole wants a recount. Now he's mad. Yeah, he got screwed in Idaho in '96.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ralph Nader, he's got a movie coming out. Did you see his movie? Show Ralph Nader's movie. There it is. 'How the Grinch Stole the Election,' right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And historians on TV are having a field day with this. This has never happened before. They keep saying, 'What an unusual election. People will be talking about that election 100 years from now.' Talking about it? They'll still be counting ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess in Palm Beach, Florida, now, 19,000 or 20,000 ballots were disqualified because they were punched twice. People picked two presidential candidates. They picked two. I can't find one guy I'd like to vote for. Two? 'Oh, they're both so good, I'm going to pick them both.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess you know by now, a lot of these Palm Beach voters are complaining that they accidentally voted for Buchanan. That's what they said. People are saying, how do you do that? Did you look over the ballot carefully? Didn't you take time to read it? Take time? This is Florida, folks.  When you're on a bran diet, you want to get in, vote and get the hell out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's an odd coincidence when you think about it. I mean, George W. Bush is the Governor of Texas, where the kids can't read, and Jeb Bush is the Governor of Florida, where the adults can't read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You got Gore, who won the popular vote, and George Bush won in the Electoral College. Who would have believed that? Gore is the popular one, and Bush is the one doing well in college, huh. Folks, it's official -- hell has frozen over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now they're talking about another election. Actually, I guess they're working it out, because Gore says he'll do best two out of three. And Bush wants to settle it with a chugging contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you something, I bet you Al Gore's pretty sorry he ever invented the Electoral College now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Bush today on the news with the band-aid on his cheek? There it is right there. There he is. See it right there, band-aid. Nothing serious. I guess he accidentally burned himself with his crack pipe apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, as it stands right now, it doesn't look like we know when the next guy is going to move into the White House, which is good news for Clinton. It will give him a couple extra days to clean up the place. Maybe he'll get his security deposit back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Speaking of the Clintons, it's already started, folks. This is unbelievable. People are already talking about a Hillary Clinton for President campaign. Isn't that unbelievable? Hey, she's got a lot of advantages. She knows the issues. She's a hard campaigner, and she can't be linked sexually to the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the White House, Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford attended a ceremony at the White House. Did you see them on TV together? Boy, it looked like the K-Mart version of Mt. Rushmore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The NBC's Bible miniseries starts this Sunday. Well, they were talking to candidates, and I guess all the candidates have seen it and liked it. They all liked our Bible miniseries. George Bush likes it, because Jesus turned water into wine. Al Gore liked it, because one guy gets credit -- you know, God -- for inventing everything. And of course, Pat Buchanan liked it because the Egyptians punished the Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it's called 'In the Beginning.' It's about Adam and Eve. It's about the Ten Commandments. Today Clinton said, 'Ten Commandments?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Of course, you all know, elderly citizens in Palm Beach, Florida, have been busy writing thousands and thousands of letters to their election board complaining that the ballot was too confusing. That's what the elderly are saying. That's right. Unfortunately, none of the letters have been received because the Palm Beach residents mailed them to their cat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;While the election is being decided, George W. Bush has apparently been very busy assembling his cabinet. That's what he's doing. And meanwhile, Al Gore has been busy resembling a cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This afternoon -- this is true -- Vice President Al Gore played touch football with his wife, Tipper, and other members of his family. That's what they did, isn't that nice? Gore scored more points than anyone else, but somehow, he still lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;If anybody was watching the news today, George W. Bush's spokesperson says that Governor Bush is now wearing a huge band-aid on the side of his face. . Apparently, it's there to cover up a minor infection, described by the spokesperson as some sort of boil. That's true, true story. Not only that, Bush says he has a boil on his ass he calls Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many people think there should be a reelection? How many people are against a reelection? How many people are for another election but with two new candidates?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This election has proved one thing -- your vote counts. And it counts over and over. And then they count it again. And then they give it to a guy to counted by hand. And then another guy counts it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now voters in Florida -- did you hear the latest thing? They're complaining they couldn't figure out how to get into the polling places because some doors were marked 'pull,' and they were pushing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big problem is nobody knows who the next president will be. We really don't know at this point. You know what we should do? Let the Teamsters run the next election, okay? Because they know who the president's going to be even before the voting starts, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush said today he is willing to wait until all the overseas ballots come in from all those countries, you know, that he's never heard of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Both guys are acting so presidential, you know? They both act like they won. They're making appointments. Like, Bush said today, his first move would be to appoint Colin Powell Secretary of State. And Gore said today his first move would be to name Ralph Nader ambassador to outer Siberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the polls, Al Gore still has the popular vote -- or at least had it until he started bringing lawyers into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore being criticized for taking this issue to court. And I've got to agree. I mean, who wants to clog up our legal system with frivolous lawsuits about who's president, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The people of Florida are making the best of this situation. Like, today, hookers in Florida announced an election special. For 20 bucks, they will give you a hand count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They counted the ballots once by machine, now they want to count them by hand. And this morning, Bush asked the federal court to stop the hand count. He says machines are much more accurate than people. Isn't this the guy who just spent last year telling us, 'I trust the people'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you've seen the news the last couple of days, you noticed that Governor Bush appeared on TV wearing a band-aid on the side of his face. I guess what happened there was, he wanted to see for himself just how hard it was to vote using one of those punch card ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest count, George W. Bush ahead of Al Gore by 388. Well, that's just in executions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republicans are accusing Gore supporters of giving homeless people cartons of cigarettes in exchange for votes for Al Gore. They were giving homeless people cigarettes to get them to vote for Gore. Actually, the Republicans tried this themselves until they realized, 'Hey, wait a minute, there are no homeless Republicans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gore is trying to look very cool. You know, he's trying to look like -- I guess on Saturday night, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman -- they took their wives out to the movies. They went to see 'Men of Honor,' and as they were walking in, they bumped into President Clinton, who was coming out of 'Charlie's Angels.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Bush was at the theater, too. He went to see 'Legend of the Drunken Master.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Later this week, President Clinton is going to Vietnam. Some Vietnamese officials are hoping that he will apologize for the Vietnam War. Apologize? Wasn't even there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;If I seem a little confused tonight, please bear with me. It's the first time we're using the new butterfly cue cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, last night the voters of Palm Beach County accidentally voted me their favorite talk show host.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's what I'm concerned about. If they keep demanding these recounts, if they don't put an end to this recounting, if the recounting doesn't stop, here's my fear: sooner or later there's going to be a winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This recount thing is fascinating. A lot of surprises. Earlier today, they found 14 missing ballots under George Bush's band-aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Doesn't he look like a wreck, that guy? I don't mean anything by this, but Bush looks like he could use a drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Because President Clinton is leaving office, every night here on the 'Late Show' we're going to be doing a classic President Clinton joke. . Tonight's classic Clinton joke comes to us from August 22, 1998. . President Clinton has gained a lot weight. He's so fat, in fact, right now he can't see who he's having sex with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Dumb Guy Ways to Solve Presidential Election Confusion: 10. Find some guy named George W. Gore. Make him President 9. Each can be president of the people who voted for them 8. Thaw out Walt Disney, let him cast the deciding vote 7. I don't care how things get solved; just don't run any special reports during 'Becker' 6. Do what they do in other important contests in Florida: swimsuit competition 5. Form Conga line with everyone in Palm Beach (won't solve a thing, but boy are they fun) 4. Whichever news anchor can stay awake the longest gets to pick 3. New rule: You punch 2 holes, voting booth explodes 2. Let my brother Jeb decide 1. Solve it? Are you nuts? This is great!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;With more recounts on the way, it seems we could find ourselves with no president at all. A phenomenon historians call Jimmy Carter. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The presidential election recount continues with no stone being left unturned. When the votes are counted and certified, one thing is certain: You and I will have been dead for centuries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;On the upside, this election is a wonderful civics lesson about how our electoral system works. The bad news is we learned it after the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Meanwhile George w. Bush suffered a slight picture to his face when an overly eager voter accidentally hole-punched him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, welcome to day seven: 'America losing interest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sorry, we're temporarily interrupting our coverage of nonstop coverage of old people in Florida yelling at each other to bring you 'The Tonight Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see those new signs they put up in Florida right at the border? Show those new signs. It says, 'By machine -- 15 million people, by hand count -- 16 million.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe how slow this recount is going? Did you see it on the news? It's like a kid at McDonald's trying to count your change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now a lot of senior citizens -- remember those ones who thought they voted for Buchanan? They thought they were voting for James Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see how some of those counties down there, they hold the (ballots) up to the light. That's what they do. I'm not making this up. They hold it to see if the light goes through it. Kind of like it's Bush's head. Look through the ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, the big problem with the hand count in Florida, all the ballots smell like Bengay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And what's the story on Warren Christopher? You see Warren Christopher? You see that guy? Man, if only he were alive to see what was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, Gore should share his makeup tips with him. He looks like the guy from 'Tales from the Crypt.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I've been watching all day. The real battle is not Gore and Bush.  The real battle is Jesse Jackson versus Alan Dershowitz for camera time. If you're in the news business, don't get between those two and a camera, you'll be crushed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I was thinking about George W. Bush on Thanksgiving. If he does become President -- you know how they always have that ceremony every year, where they bring out the Thanksgiving turkey and then they pardon it? How does that make guys on death row in Texas feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Although President Clinton is on his way to Vietnam, he'll be back for his last Thanksgiving dinner at the White House next week. That's got to be kind of bittersweet for him, don't you think? Seeing that big butterball with its legs up in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in a bombshell that has rocked the publishing industry, the New York Daily News reporting Bill Clinton already has written his memoirs. They're all done. How could that be? The guy couldn't remember Paula Jones. Said he never met her. Don't remember having sex with Monica. 'I don't recall' -- what memoirs? He doesn't remember anything. What is this, two pages long?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nobody even knows what the book is going to be yet. I just hope it's not one of these oral histories of the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I don't know if you've noticed this too, but all of the news channels covering the election controversy in Florida have been giving their coverage different names. Everyone gives it a different name to try and be cooler than the other guy. This is true. For example, MSNBC calls it &quot; Battle for the White House.' CNN is calling it 'Florida Recount.' And Fox is calling it 'When Bikini Voters Attack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A Florida judge ruled that state officials can cut off the vote recount in the Presidential election at 5:00 PM. That's the latest. That's true. Yeah, apparently -- apparently, the ballots had to be in by 5:00 so the vote counters wouldn't miss the early bird special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton is in Brunei right now on his way to Vietnam. Isn't that exciting? Gonna go to Vietnam. Big move, yeah. Which is really great because now is the perfect time to convince those countries that democracy is the way to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to brand new polls that just came out a few hours ago, most Americans say they're sick -- sick of hearing about the election problems on the news. They've had enough. That's what they're saying. Yeah, so after hearing this, President Clinton offered, for the sake of the country, to have oral sex with Monica Lewinsky again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I had to go to the doctor today. You know why? I have a hanging chad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This recount thing has gone crazy. Earlier today they found two dozen more ballots in Gloria Estefan's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They think the entire mess down in Florida may come down to the absentee ballot of Elian Gonzalez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore had a press conference yesterday. Why is he wearing a band- aid now, too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The candidates have worked out a compromise. . Here's how it's going to work: George W. Bush will be president of the red states. Al W. Gore will be president of the blue states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Because President Clinton, he's only got a couple of months left in office, right here on the 'Late Show' we're doing a Clinton classic joke. . Now, tonight's Clinton classic, I told on January 30, 1998: 'President Clinton over the weekend went to see the motion picture &quot;Titanic.&quot; You know Clinton and the Titanic have a great deal in common. Yeah. 1,200 people also went down on him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;If he does make it past the Florida recount, George W. Bush will tackle his next obstacle: saying the word inaugural.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore has brought in Warren Christopher to fight for his side. That's too bad. Gore gets an advocate and I lose a garden gnome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Record cold last night in LA, 25 degrees -- 25 degrees in parts of LA Well, that's the hand count. By the machine, 27 degrees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;God, do we have a President yet? Do you believe this? Why is it taking so long? This election -- and what is it, this much? This thing is closer than a Brazilian bikini wax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;People keep saying, 'Why is it taking so long? Why can't they move forward?' Do the math, okay? You got politicians who have hired lawyers who get paid by the hour to investigate government appointees who are talking to retired people living in Florida. Okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, this is unbelievable. You put this group in a room, you actually go back in time is what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There are two possible ways this thing could go. One is the whole thing could wind up being decided by a judge. And today, George W. Bush says he doesn't want it to be decided by a judge. You can understand that. I think he's afraid he'll get that same judge that sentenced him in the drunk driving case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Then the other one is the election could be determined by absentee ballots sent in by former Florida residents living overseas. Oh, great, people who don't think enough of our country to stay here -- they'll decide who the next president is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Al Gore playing touch football with his family? Did he ever play touch football in his life? All of a sudden, he's out on the lawn like a Kennedy playing touch football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, they showed George W. Bush playing a game of fetch with his dog. A game of fetch. You know the sad part? The dog won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I love how smug the foreign countries are about this. Did you see the Germans and the English, 'Well, the Americans -' Like, today, I was watching British and German reporters on the news. This is what they said - 'The US election has descended into confusion, and it is a pitiful country. ' That's what they call it -- a pitiful country. These people can't have a soccer game without starting a civil war. Suddenly we're a pitiful country. Shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Big anniversary today. The American Federation for Labor. The American Federation for Labor union was founded on this day in 1881. Actually, it would have been founded sooner, but everybody was on break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, did you see that picture in the paper the other day of President Clinton walking to his helicopter to begin his trip to Vietnam? Did you see who's with him? His mother-in-law. She's going with him. That's when you know you screwed up, okay? When your wife sends you to 'Nam with your mother-in-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;They're still counting in New Mexico. And at the moment, Al Gore is leading by only 375 votes. That's the latest. Meanwhile, George W. Bush says he didn't even campaign in New Mexico because he doesn't like to travel overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The recount in New Mexico is close -- this sounds like a lie, but it's true. If it ends up tied, their state law says that the winner is decided by drawing straws or playing a hand of poker. This is according to New Mexico's Attorney General, Pete Rose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Fox Network, which was the first channel to say that George W. Bush had won the presidency on election night, so they were the first ones to get it wrong -- they have just unveiled a new slogan which is 'the number one network for political coverage.' That's right, yeah. Fox's second choice for a slogan was, 'We get it wrong first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Florida voters in Israel are very angry because they say they punched the wrong hole and accidentally voted for Yasser Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I don't understand the process by which people place their absentee ballots. It takes forever to count these things. It's a very, very slow process. Earlier today seven absentee ballots came in for Dukakis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But as this goes on, as long as this continues, the eyes of the world are on Florida and the recount. The eyes of the world now keenly trained on Florida. You know what that means? It means right now Clinton is getting laid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think I've been watching the television coverage a little too long. I've developed a crush on that Bush spokeswoman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush is very confident. . Today he named three more appointees to his imaginary cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Every night here on the 'Late Show' we're doing a classic Clinton joke. . We first did tonight's classic Clinton joke on June 2, 1998: Hillary is in Egypt today and took a ride on a camel, which is a coincidence because her husband, Bill Clinton, is also between humps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Florida's Secretary of State has halted all ballot counting until after some of the legal wranglings have been figured out. The bad news is that could take forever. The good news, some of the lawyers will be dead by then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton was in Brunei today were he addressed a gathering of third world leaders at the Asian Pacific economic council. He said the election crisis may help both parties to work together, which leads many to conclude he finally inhaled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you folks are confused Floridians who walked in here by mistake?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;All week long, because of this election screw-up down there in Palm Beach, the citizens of Palm Beach County have been asking themselves the same question over and over and over again, 'What would Matlock do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think, if we have learned one thing collectively as a nation, as a great nation, as a republic, if we have learned one thing, I believe it would be this. Please, ladies and gentlemen, next time, let's get back to a low voter turnout, all right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last night, Al W. Gore's on television and he offers George Bush a compromise position, and George Bush was so stunned, he called an emergency meeting of his imaginary cabinet.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, very busy, though. Very busy. Today he announced that his weird-looking attorney general would be Karen Hughes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's quite a practical joker, this George W. Bush. To break the tension...he goes down to death row there, and he's getting ready to administer a lethal injection. Instead, he gives the guy a flu shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore is starting to see the handwriting on the wall. All day long, he's been practicing his Nixon helicopter wave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Every night here, until President Clinton leaves office, we're doing a classic Clinton joke. This Clinton classic joke, we originally told this on June 2, 1998: Earlier today, President Clinton banged his head on a door in the White House, and I believe it's the first thing that he's banged there that didn't hire a powerful attorney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;It is day 10 trillion in the Florida election debacle. I say we give it one more week then we give ourselves back to England.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's cold here. In fact, not just LA, it's so cold in Texas today, George W. Bush kicked a guy out of the electric chair just for the heat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On a serious note, with the holidays coming up, the Postal Service has asked me to remind people, please mail your absentee ballots early if you want them counted in Florida before Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This Florida election is tighter than Katherine Harris' face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you, it's so funny. A lot of the comments in the newspaper and they're talking about her makeup. Very catty. She doesn't know how to put on makeup. She doesn't know how to apply eye shadow. She doesn't know how to apply blush. And you know who's saying this? Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I feel sorry some of those folks in Florida. You move down there for the arthritis and then they make you count ballots by hand. No wonder it's so slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some good news though, they are making it easier in the future. In the next election, people will be able to vote by the clapper. Clap on, Gore. Clap off, Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And what happened today? More breaking news. The news is just broken now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's something sure to make him popular: the Al Gore campaign has put out an emergency call to the American Bar Association. They want 500 lawyers, 500 additional lawyers to fly down to Florida to help conduct this recount. 500. Usually when you see that many lawyers in one place, you're in Hell, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're saying the whole election could be decided by absentee ballots sent in from people living overseas. See, I don't think that's fair. If you vote for a guy, you should have to move back here and suffer the rest of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All the communist nations, like China and Cuba, they're acting so smug. They're all acting so superior. Like Castro said today that the voter confusion was our own fault for putting more than one name on the ballot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Pregnant chad -- you know what that is? When you vote, you stick the pin through. If the pin doesn't go all the way through the paper and it just pokes out, that's called a chad. If it's poked out, that's called a pregnant chad. How do you make a dent in the ballot and not make the hole through. Were people dying when they were voting? Were they nodding off? How physically unfit are we in this country that we can't go all the way through on a piece of paper?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I just like saying the word 'Floridian.' Because I never said that, I always said people from Florida. Floridian makes it sound like a bad episode of 'Star Trek.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What did I read? Now North Dakota, North Dakota recounting their votes. No reason. There's just nothing else to do there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton is in Vietnam today. I feel sorry for the guy picking him up at the airport. He's been waiting 30 years for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, the Clippers beat the Knicks last night. How about that? The Clippers. What is that? 78-74. These are people that should be asking for a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After just three weeks after its debut, Kathie Lee's CD dropped completely off the charts. In fact, it seems the only people that bought the CD were some confused Palm Beach voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Senator Trent Lott said that Thomas Jefferson was elected after facing a situation very similar to the one now. And he turned out to be a great President. Nice thought. I thought so. Yeah. Yeah, and when he heard this, George W. Bush said, 'Wait a minute, I thought Thomas Jefferson was a high school.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This was in the news today. If there is going to be a statewide recount in Florida, if we do have one, former President Jimmy Carter has offered to oversee it. That's right. Yeah, and apparently, Al Gore told Carter, 'No, thanks, I can lose this one on my own. I'm fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This kind of signals the end of an era. In the state of Arkansas, they have begun taking down the 80 signs within its boarders that say 'Home of President Clinton.' That's right. The 80 signs have been purchased and will be displayed in Hooters restaurants all across the country. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What's going on in Florida? Or as they call it, 'God's Counting Room,' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All the cable channels offering 24 hours of breaking news. They have breaking news on the screen. Whenever you watch, it's always breaking news. Now this is true, okay. A couple of times I'm watching their breaking news, they break into the breaking news with other breaking news. Is that breaking breaking news?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Secretary of the State of Florida, Katherine Harris, cannot certify the votes tomorrow. It was going to be over tomorrow. So she can't do it. Thank God. I was afraid it would end prematurely. You hate to see a rush to judgment on this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, (Secretary of State Katherine Harris) says she's 43 years old. I would like a recount on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I keep hearing this phrase 'pregnant chad.' Have you heard that phrase the last couple of days? That thing on the ballot, it's a pregnant chad. Boy, that sounds like Sigfried and Roy's worst nightmare, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you watched TV the other night, both Gore and Bush appeared on TV making proposals to each other. Did you see that? Why did it have to go on my TV? Don't they have each other's phone numbers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, Al Gore says he just wants to meet with George Bush face- to- face, one-on-one. He figures if he can slip Bush the tongue like he did with Tipper that time, maybe he'll win him over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore supporters keep saying this election will be decided by the will of the people. The will of the people. The same people who made Charlie's Angels the number one movie. This is who is deciding your President, ladies and gentlemen, the will of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Every time you turn on the TV you see Gore and his family playing touch football. They're trying to be Kennedy-esque. Playing touch football. Actually, they're pretty good. This past weekend, they beat the San Diego Chargers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the US Supreme Court ordered a stay of execution for a Texas man who is considered to be mentally retarded. They were gonna, I guess, execute this guy. They said he was mentally retarded. Lawyers describe him having an IQ of 50 to 60, the reasoning capacity of a 7- year-old child -- oh, that's Governor Bush. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see George Bush playing fetch with his dog, yesterday? They're playing fetch because the dog beat him two out of three times at Scrabble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And tomorrow in Tallahassee, the University of Florida playing Florida State. Big college football showdown. The bad news, the Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, already declared Florida the winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton is in Vietnam now. While he was there, he says he will not apologize to the Vietnamese for the war. Well, duh, he never apologized to Hillary. Why apologize to people you don't know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newt Gingrich had his official portrait unveiled in the capital this week. It's very accurate. Very accurate portrait. It shows him voting to impeach Bill Clinton while throttling his secretary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Medical news, here you go, this unbelievable. This woman in Texas had her heart taken out, literally taken out, repaired and put back in. The heart was repaired using parts from a cow heart. How bad is her HMO, using cow hearts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More trouble in Florida. A Denny's restaurant today in Spring, Florida, ran into trouble when a transsexual and a female impersonator were both caught using the woman's restroom. And here is a situation where you really don't want to do a hand count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A spokesperson for George W. Bush said for the past few days -- this is true -- George W. has kept his TV completely turned off. Isn't watching any of this. Yeah, and the problem is -- the problem is he's been annoying everybody around him by constantly asking, 'What are the Teletubbies up to?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore says if he ends up winning the election -- if he wins, he'd be more than happy to travel to George W. Bush's home so they can meet and discuss national unity. That's what he said. Yeah, then, apparently - - apparently George W. has a different proposal. He offered to meet Gore in hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In college football, Florida State outscored Florida 30-7. But attorneys for Florida, however -- this is interesting -- they challenged the outcome saying they had intended to score but were unable due to confusion -- what's that word? Ambiguity in the rules, so they want a recount. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you realize when this whole recount thing started, Warren Christopher was only 24 years old?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see any of the Florida Supreme Court hearings today? Did you watch any of that? I taped it, so don't tell me what happens, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they said today if we can't pick a President by January, we'll have no foreign policy, no domestic policy and no electoral mandate, so it will be -- like right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other week, Bush and Gore -- their camps asked for more lawyers to volunteer down there in Florida. They want more lawyers to come down. There's over 500 lawyers down there right now. They want more. Well, they're losing them, though. Every time an ambulance goes by, 20 or 30 go chasing after it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But some good news today. Barbara Bush said if George W. Bush does win the election by Thanksgiving, he will be able to sit at the big table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see Gore on TV the other night? They trying to make him more like a regular guy. He's just a regular fellow. Yesiree, Bob. Like, he gives his speech from the living room at the vice presidential mansion. Did you see this? And he's standing in front of the fireplace. He's got the mantle behind him, and on the mantle, family photos of him and the children. They're hugging, all very homey looking. And then they pull back, and you see the podium and go, 'Who has a podium in their living room?' Only Al Gore would have a podium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In his speech the other night, Al Gore called for 'improving the dialogue in America.' Hey, forget America, how about improving the dialogue in that Charlie's Angels movie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So cold in Florida. Do you know that Secretary of State Katherine Harris wore a third layer of makeup today?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, where did she get that face lift? Big garage sale at Joan Collins' house? One of those Beverly Hills wind tunnel ones. Like a dog with its head out the window of a Porsche going 180.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Federal agents in New Orleans raided the home of former KKK leader David Duke on suspicion that Duke might be using funds he raised for his white supremacist association -- he might be using money for his own use. Well, all it takes is one bad apple. This kind of thing could ruin the Klan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please hold your applause until the overseas ballots come in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Republicans are upset. They're saying now that the ballots are being over-handled. That's what they're saying, the ballots are being overhandled. It's the same complaint they had about the White House interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'll tell you one thing, though, everybody has got election fever. Even President Clinton has a little dose of election fever. Earlier today, he called for a hand count in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But the Democrats have this strategy, though. You know, the Secretary of State down there in Florida, Katherine Harris, here's what they're going to do. The Democrats are sending Clinton down to Florida to hit on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm getting to like Katherine Harris. I like watching her whenever she's on. I keep thinking she's going to say, 'Would you care for a hot towel before landing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Don't kid yourself. We're making fun of her. She's a very strong woman. As a matter of fact, her hair was the only thing left standing after Hurricane Andrew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton classic was first told here on the show July . Do you know what you were doing July 22, 1999? Huh, do you remember? Okay, well here's the Clinton Classic first told right here July 22 of '99. President Clinton said that he's all excited and ready to become Joe Citizen after he leaves office, and I thought, well, that's odd because until now, he's been Joe Blow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Everybody's into those holiday films. There's the new updated version of Miracle on 34th Street that's coming out. On TV, they just had Santa Who? In fact, there's a new one coming out next weekend called 'Miracle in Palm Beach.' It's a fascinating story. It's about a Florida voter who's actually able to figure out his ballot and votes for the candidate of his choice without a single hitch. It was a miracle!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Latest is George W. Bush seems to have won the overseas votes, which just goes to prove the further you live away from the US, the better he looks, apparently.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, all day yesterday, the networks had nothing but those court proceedings from Florida, did you see that? Like, all afternoon, just, 'I motion this, motion that.' It was so boring. Don't you hate that court stuff? I'm glad today they finally got back to the regular daytime shows, you know, like, Judge Judy, People's Court, Judge Mills Lane, Judge Joe Brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And things don't look too good for Al Gore. He's not getting as many votes in this recount thing as he thought he was going to get. In fact, today, the Chinese said they want some of their money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Governor Bush, continuing to execute people down there. I tell you, death goes on no matter what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But you know, he's very philosophical about it. Think of the Bush philosophy this way: Give a man a fish, you just feed him for a day. Kill him, you don't have to worry about feeding ever again, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton just back from Vietnam. Yeah, Bill's home from 'Nam, everybody, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Think he'll be sitting down with John McCain swapping war stories?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;While he was there, he told Vietnamese people, 'We met here as adversaries, now we work as partners,' which is kind of funny, because with Hillary, it's the exact opposite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But President Clinton says he came home from 'Nam a little bit early because he wanted to be here for Thanksgiving. And you know Clinton, he loves Thanksgiving. That's his favorite holiday. Well, sure, the one day of the year he can unbuckle his pants after dinner and not get sued over it, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Massachusetts, a trial has just begun where a nurse is accused of killing four patients at a veterans hospital just for the thrill. That's what they said, she did it just for the thrill of it. Well, looks like Bush may have found his new Surgeon General, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Some Republican congressmen now are actually threatening to boycott the inauguration and the parade to the White House if Al Gore becomes President. They're gonna boycott it. It's amazing. Not only that, George W. Bush is threatening to boycott the Macy's Thanksgiving parade if they don't have a Scooby-Doo balloon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton says that this Thanksgiving, we should share the spirit of fellowship and reinforce the ties of our community. Isn't that nice? Yeah, meanwhile, George W. Bush says that this Thanksgiving, Democrats should screw off and let him be President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's very cold here in New York. It's so cold that up in Chappaqua, the Clintons actually got in the same bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;A word of advice to tourists: If you are stabbed and the blade does not go all the way through, that is dimpled and does not count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you following the recount down in Florida? Today they found 800 more ballots in Katherine Harris' hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There are now a thousand lawyers down in Florida. It's like Spring break for shysters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They say this whole thing down in Florida could come down the absentee ballot of Darrell Strawberry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here is tonight's classic Clinton joke. This was originally told on October 7. 1999: Hillary Clinton is traveling in Italy. That's right, Hillary is in Florence and Bill is in Rhonda.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Before we begin, let's just take a moment. Take a moment to bow our heads. Let's all give thanks to the fact that we don't live in Florida, yeah!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy Thanksgiving. Boy, we had a good lunch, ooh, what a dinner we had, man. I feel like a pregnant chad. Oh, man, I ate too much.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I realized something today. We're actually celebrating Thanksgiving this year a lot like the early Pilgrims. You know, they didn't have a president, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I read a sad story today about a lot of folks going hungry in South Florida. . Lot of folks going hungry down there. I guess they weren't able to break through the skin of the turkey to carve it. They could poke at the turkey and make a dimple, but they weren't -- physically able to cut through. Sad, sad story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, today everybody's thinking about what they're thankful for. In fact, President Clinton was on TV earlier today, and he thanked the American people for letting him live out his dream. And then he thanked Hillary for just letting him live, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, you know, President Clinton has a family connection with the early pilgrims. Did you know this? . Yes, yes. To this day, when he checks into a hotel, he still uses the name John Smith. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see him on the news last night? President Clinton pardoning the White House turkey. He does that every year where they pardon the turkey, which proves, man, he is a sucker for anything with a tiny brain and big breasts, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, man, I had a terrible nightmare last night. I tell you this, terrible nightmare. . Oh, my God. I dreamed Dick Cheney was in Buffalo shoveling snow after eating a big turkey dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Dick Cheney suffered a mild heart attack. I guess doctors became concerned when they noticed that Cheney was as white as Warren Christopher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But the doctors say he's gonna be fine. They said he should be able to resume his usual activities in a few days. I thought having a heart attack pretty much was Dick Cheney's usual activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Cheney checked himself into a hospital after he noticed he was having minor chest pains. He checked himself in. See, he knew it wasn't serious, because since he's a Republican, you see, the heart is not a vital organ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, I thought this was nice. His rival, Joe Lieberman -- you know, Gore's running mate -- Joe Lieberman actually called Dick Cheney in the hospital. You know what he said? 'Boo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, a lot of Democrats are actually suspicious of the timing of this heart attack. They think Cheney might be pulling a Fred Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I understand we have Army, we have Marines from Ft. Irwin and Ft.  Winemi, right? Ft. Winemi, where are they? . There we go. A lot of people don't know this -- Winemi is an old Indian word meaning 'your votes don't count.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you guys are lucky you got in, the military personnel, you know. Al Gore's lawyers tried to get your tickets thrown out. They were outside the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the latest ruling in the Florida Supreme Court, is they said, 'the will of the people prevails.' That's what they said. Except in the Florida Keys, where the will of the village people prevails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Every Thanksgiving, and this is true -- Senator Joe Lieberman has to avoid anything that isn't kosher. That's right. So as a result, he's staying away from the recount in Florida completely.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard, it looks like it's going to be President Smirk -- I mean, Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Florida votes were certified by Secretary of State Katherine Harris -- or as Gore calls her during the holidays, 'The Nutcracker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It actually looks like the election will take longer than the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is what I like, when they ask the Gore spokesman when it'll be over. This is what the Gore spokesman said today in the news. He said, 'It's going to the courts, and that will bring it to an end.' See, only in politics you go to court to speed things up.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You've got Bush and Gore headed to the Supreme Court. So you got George W. Bush's intelligence to be pitted against Al Gore's honesty. This is more like a case of small claims court, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore said today, despite the setbacks, he is keeping hope alive. And Bush said, despite the setbacks, he is keeping Dick Cheney alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dick Cheney recovering well from the heart attack. He had a little press conference today. He left the hospital over the weekend, which is good news for Warren Christopher. Now there's a bed available, so now he'll be able to check in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dick Cheney's cardiologist said today, although his heart function is not normal -- his heart is not normal, his health is excellent. What does that mean? . See, for Republicans, the heart is considered a secondary organ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Joe Lieberman -- he came out swinging today. . he had some harsh words for the Republicans. He said it is important that every vote be counted for every American that voted. Unless, of course, you're in the military. The Democrats threw those away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Republicans -- they're fighting back, too. Did you see what they did over -- oh, boy. Over the weekend, they gave Viagra to Bob Dole and used him to demonstrate how to poke a hole in a ballot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The guys on death row in Texas, they were high-fiving each other when they heard Bush won because that means, hey, new governor!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Governor Bush now beginning to outline some of his programs. Today, he called for putting an additional 10,000 police officers on the street, and that's just to arrest Robert Downey, Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I hate talking about people when they're not here, but Friday night's audience.Whoa! Rough, rough, ugly crowd. When they left the show, right after the show, they went to the Broward County canvassing board and caused all kind of trouble, just tore the place up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you saw George W. Bush last night on television after they certified? George was unveiling his new presidential deer-in-the- headlights look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George said that the outcome is clear. Yeah, it's about as clear as a Robert Downey, Jr. urine test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then George W. said that he's putting vice presidential hopeful Dick Cheney -- he's going to put Dick Cheney in charge of the transition. Oh, yeah, let's put this guy under a little more pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And today, George W. began his transition from beer to scotch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last night was a big night for Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris. Did you see her? She even wore her lucky Dalmatian coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Katherine Harris is in the middle of her 15 minutes of fame. . Here's stage one of the 15 minutes of fame. Public ridicule, that's stage one. Number two is the beauty makeover. That's stage two. Stage three: Posing naked in 'Playboy.' That's stage three. Stage four: Becoming Mrs. Larry King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton classic was originally told on this show September 15, 1998, over two years ago. President Clinton has hired two spiritual advisors to meet and pray with him during his impeachment trial. Oh, great, that's just what Clinton needs, more people kneeling in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night the Florida votes were certified in favor of George W. Bush. And it appears we finally have a president which can only mean one thing: we still don't have a president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This woman in New Jersey accidentally glued one of her eyes shut, when instead of using eye drops -- this is true -- picked up Krazy Glue, put Krazy Glue in her eye and sealed her eye shut. Now, the woman says it was not an accident. She was just sick of watching election coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, Vice President Al Gore addressed the nation. A lot of folks in Palm Beach, Florida, missed watching it because they couldn't put the right channel on their remote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Al Gore was on every channel last night. 8:55, you click around, it was Al Gore on every channel. It was like that movie The Day The Earth Stood Still. 'People of earth, do not be alarmed. I come in peace to save you from your newly elected President. . I am Gore.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know if you noticed, when Gore first spoke to the nation two weeks ago, he had one flag behind him. Then Bush spoke the other night, he had two flags. . Then last night, Gore -- three flags. Did you see that? Three flags. The nation isn't running out of patience, we're running out of flags.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't Bush the worst speaker? You know, when Bush speaks, he looks like a dog that heard a new noise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know what's causing more problems for Gore, the state of Florida or the state of denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, it's not looking good. According to the latest polls, 60% of Americans want Al Gore to concede the election, the other 40% are those lawyers working for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But yesterday, he got some support. The AFL-CIO gave its support to Al Gore, they told Al Gore to fight on. When Bush heard about it, he said, 'AFL-CIO' -- he said, 'How do you spell that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And then Gore spoke again today. Like we're just waiting to hear more. You know, Gore kind of reminds you of that kid -- remember when you were a kid and you were playing 'Monopoly,' after three hours, everyone would want to quit except for one kid? 'Hey, I still have Baltic. Come on, you can land on my hotel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush is very excited about becoming President. In fact, earlier today, he called his dad to get the address of the White House. 'Thinking of driving by, checking it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And each day that goes by, Bush gets a little more confident. He was at the White House today, one of the White House gift shops, and bought a little mug that said 'President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush has pled unity. He says he wants Republicans and Democrats to work together. Republicans and Democrats working together. Have you heard Bush talk? His brain and his mouth can't work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I tell you, it's getting nasty. Like, today, President Clinton said he will not let Bush have any money to pay for the transition. You know, normally, you get money for the new guy. Not getting any money. In fact, to add insult to injury, instead of Secret Service protection, today Bush was given a can of mace and told, 'Hey, you're on your own.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't think Clinton cares anymore. He's having fun in office. He's just doing whatever he wants. See what he did today? This didn't get much publicity. He signed an executive order today outlawing panties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said he'd like to work in the Internet because it will give him a chance to work with young people and get his juices flowing. That's what he said. You know, that's what he said. My hand to God. I mean, after all that's gone down, is that the best choice of words, 'to get his juices flowing?' Hello? If his juices are flowing any faster, he's going to look like old faithful, for goodness sakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton was on the Today show this morning selling her new book. It's called 'An invitation to the White House.' And the book is $35. And Hillary says it's the exact tour of the White House. It takes you to every room except the Lincoln Bedroom. That's, I think, like, $10, 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Canada held its elections today. Now Al Gore claims he won that one, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The people in Ontario couldn't figure out the ballot, part of it was in French or something, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a last ditch effort to get Robert Downey Jr. off drugs. They're going to try one of these intervention things. What they're going to do is have George Bush Sr. adopt him and then tell him he has to straighten himself out by the time he turns 40.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senator Joe Lieberman called the voting recount in Florida incomplete. That's what he said. That's right, yeah, and in response, George W. Bush said, 'What's wrong with incomplete? That was my best grade in college.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that if Al Gore doesn't become president this time, he will not run again in 2004 because his wife Tipper does not want him to. Yeah. Oh. And also, because America does not want him to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Dick Cheney says that George W. Bush plans on emphasizing diversity in his administration. That's what he says. That's right. It's true, apparently, they're gonna hire white guys from all different parts of Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A spokesperson for George W. Bush says if Bush ends up being president, there's a good possibility he will appoint some Democrats to his cabinet. That's what he says he's gonna do. For instance, George W. Bush is planning on appointing Al Gore as his 'Secretary of Kiss My Ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;These Florida ballot counters have been counting the ballots over and over and over and over again, and you know how they do it? They hold them up to the sun. Well, what's happened now. All of them, have been.disabled because their faces are covered with hundreds of these burned- chad markings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody is starting to lose patience with this election.  As a matter of fact, Yankee great Yogi Berra earlier today called Al Gore and said, 'It's over!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I thought this showed some progress. Today, the two candidates -- George W. Bush and Al W. Gore...agreed to a fourth and decisive debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore, bless his heart, is desperately trying to keep people interested in this, and tomorrow, I believe, he's going to seal himself in a six ton block of ice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has hired a new legal team. Well, that'll speed things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They had Cheney call Bill Clinton to see about the transition, and the transition people said, 'We're not giving Bush the keys to the transition room at the White House.' And I was thinking, you know, it's probably not the first time somebody has refused to give Bush the keys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is a Clinton classic joke. I originally told this joke February, 1999: The Republicans want Monica Lewinsky to testify in front of the Senate so they will have the opportunity to look her right in the eye. And was thinking to myself, well, hell, even Clinton hasn't done that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We still don't have a president. How many are mad that Ponce de Leon even discovered Florida in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, man, I think he's going too far with these hand counts. He demanded a hand count to make sure there are really two scoops of raisins in every box of Raisin Bran!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you heard the latest? Al Gore declared himself the winner of the eight-state Powerball lottery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is where we are: George W. Bush is in Texas and won't say anything. Al Gore is in Washington and won't shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The White House announced that they are going to start giving George W. Bush daily briefings on national security matters, and Bush is very upset about it. He said, 'Do I have to? I'm not even president yet and I'm getting homework?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a brief submitted to the Supreme Court, Al Gore's lawyers have said that George W. Bush's arguments on the presidential election are insubstantial. That's what he said. That's right, yeah. And George W. denied this. And he said, 'My arguments aren't in substantial. They're in English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;If George W. Bush becomes president and names Colin Powell as his secretary of state, Powell will be the highest-ranked black cabinet member in US history. Isn't that something? That's very cool. Highest- ranked black cabinet member in history. After hearing this, George W. Bush said, 'Wait a minute, he's black?' That's what he said. He said, 'I hope Dad knows what he's doing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton said that someday, she will publish her memoirs and they will address her husband's infidelity. Yeah. And Hillary said she's already halfway through because she's finished the first 27 volumes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I had a fun day today. You know what I did? I went to see that brand new movie, a little matinee. I slipped away and went to see it, 'Rugrats in Broward County.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Coming back from the movie, I went through Central Park, and I saw one of those scenes you only see in New York City. I'm coming through the park, and I saw a squirrel hand-counting his nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight on the Larry King show Dick Cheney was the guest. And of course, Larry King has had multiple heart attacks, and Dick Cheney has had four heart attacks, so you had two guys on the Larry King show talking for an hour about clogged arteries, and they still got a younger audience than we get here at CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has a new team of lawyers. They're pretty good. They're the team, I believe, that handled his last drunk driving arrest, so they're first rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The good news is the White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings. Some of these jokes actually write themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I feel bad for George W. because he's talking like he wants to be the president, but when you see him, you can tell he really doesn't want to be the president. And as a result, George W. is getting no respect whatsoever. Earlier today, and all day today, he was waiting outside the White House gates for the cable guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And now, President Clinton has said what he would like to do when his term of office is finished in a couple of years. . He would like to be the mayor of New York City. That's great. That means we get back the strip joints and the hookers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's our Clinton classic joke of the night, and tonight's joke was originally told February 10, 1999. . The impeachment trial continues in the Senate. Each senator gets 15 minutes on the floor. It's the same deal President Clinton has with the interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In an interview this morning Al Gore said he has a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency. George W. Bush said his odds were better at 70-70.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Al Gore said on the today show yesterday he believes his chances of winning the presidency are 50-50. Really? I think he's been drinking Mad Dog 20-20.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Gore &quot;has been on TV more than Regis. He was on again today. . I think I figured out Al's strategy. I think at this point, he's just trying to annoy us into giving him the presidency.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I have a solution for this whole mess, okay? Let's just make Al Gore President of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush -- this guy is no day at the beach, either. You see him on TV? Not the most convincing speaker. Doesn't he always look like he's waiting for the guy at the DMV to take his picture?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Dick Cheney -- he's on TV everywhere, too. Every time you turn around, he's on. He's doing press conferences, he's setting up the transition team back in Washington. He was on Larry King the other night. Today, he flew down to Texas. What's Bush doing? Bush is relaxing on the ranch. Which guy had the heart attack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think Bush is trying to kill Cheney at this point. 'Hey, Dick, when you get a minute, will you move my barbells into the garage? I appreciate it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And OJ Simpson on the news today. He had his two cents. Did you hear about this? He said he voted. OJ said he voted in Miami. Finally a voter down there we know can stab through a piece of paper, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How long is this going to go on? Do you realize Robert Downey Jr.  could be straightened out before the election is? Isn't that unbelievable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton told USA Today she is thinking about writing a personal account of her years at the White House. How about that? Which I think would be refreshing. Finally, a personal story about the Clinton years by a woman who didn't have sex with the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Officials in Little Rock, Arkansas, have announced they're going to rename a downtown street after President Clinton. How awkward is that for people giving directions? 'All right, make a left turn on Main. And then you go down on Bill Clinton, all right? Go down on Bill Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The new President of Mexico, Vicente Fox came out with force. He wants more.open borders with the US. More open borders? Hello? What has got, a moving walkway, like at Disneyland?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new study, by the year 2230, 100% of Americans are expected to be overweight. How big are Clinton's girlfriends going to be then?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The country still has no president-elect, and now, Al Gore actually -- he's been on every show in the world. He's gonna do the Hollywood Squares tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In an interview, Al Gore said that his chances of winning the election are 50-50. That's what he says now. That's right meanwhile, George W. Bush says his chances of winning the election are 70-50.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Political experts say that people should not worry about George W. Bush being inexperienced because if he does become president, he'll be surrounded by highly regarded people like Dick Cheney and Colin Powell. They're saying we shouldn't worry. In fact, George W.'s only responsibility at the White House will be killing spiders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Thousands of ballots were driven from Palm Beach county all the way up to the state capitol in Tallahassee. Put them in a truck and drove them all the way. Yeah, and folks, you can tell it was a Florida driver because for the entire 450 miles, the truck had its right blinker on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This is getting weird. Until the election crisis is formally over, the White House is refusing -- they're refusing to let George W. Bush's team use the transition office. Things are getting nasty. However, President Clinton did agree to let Bush's team hold meetings in his regular booth at hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I had a Christmas dream -- actually, I had a Christmas nightmare. It wasn't a dream. It was a nightmare. I dreamed I was visited by the ghost of Christmas future and we still didn't have a president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I'm a little worried about this election. This is getting scary now. Like, I'm driving to work today and a guy in a Ryder truck pulls up, and he says, 'Hey, how do you get to Tallahassee?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, if you've been watching TV, you've seen truck loads of disputed ballots. They're headed north, they're headed north to Tallahassee. On the other lane heading south is the stock market, ladies and gentlemen. Heading south passing each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yes, big Ryder truck on TV going on the highway. Big 'Rent Me' sign on the front of the truck with the ballots in it. In the whole state of Florida, isn't there one state-owned truck?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Does the fate of our country really depend on whether Ryder had something available this weekend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And you think constitutional law is tough to figure out. Wait until they try to figure out the fine print on at Ryder truck rental agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, the Supreme Court is deliberating and they asked George W. Bush today for comment. I don't think he quite understands it. . I don't think he gets it. Like he didn't think the justices were even ready today because when he saw them, he said they were still in their robes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now from the kind of questions the Supreme Court asked today, a lot of experts are predicting maybe they'll rule in favor of Al Gore. Bush is upset about this, too. He said, 'Hey, my daddy gave a lot of those guys their jobs!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And they released the audiotape then. An audiotape came out today and a CD. And they're selling them. You can buy.these things. Yeah, so I guess Kathie Lee moves down another notch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush said today, he did not listen to the proceedings because he doesn't have cable. That's what he said. On his ranch, he doesn't have cable. See, that's why Cheney is doing all of the transition work in Washington. Bush is back at the ranch waiting for the cable guy apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't that amazing, there's no cable at his ranch. You know what that means? He has to go all the way to the state capital if he wants to watch wrestling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I was watching that magician, David Blaine, you know the guy who has the ABC special. You know the guy, he was frozen in a block of ice for what, 61 hours. There's your solution right there. I mean the election is going to take years to figure out at this point. Why not take Bush and Gore, freeze them both in a block of ice and then thaw out the winner and leave the other guy, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore not giving up. Al Gore says he is fighting for principles. I wish he tried a little more of that during the Clinton Administration, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And people keep criticizing George W. Bush. They say, every time he speaks he gets that 'deer in the headlight' look. As opposed to President Clinton, who's always got that 'dog humping your leg' look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's great, though? You watch these proceedings in Florida. I keep wondering where are all of these hot sexy looking lawyers? (On) the Practice, you got Dylan McDermott, you got Ally McBeal. You got Lucy Liu. All I see are a bunch of fat middle-aged guys with bad comb-overs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, this ballot count now affecting all aspects of life in Florida. You know, the space launch today. Well, here take a look. See what happened there. 'Ignition in ten, nine, eight, -- six. Oh, damn. Better do a recountdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest rumor is when President Clinton leaves office, he's going to run for mayor of New York City. How about that, huh? Wow, that would be cool. Instead of the city that never sleeps, it will be the city that never sleeps alone, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton said yesterday, this is an actual quote, he said, he may not have been the greatest president, but he's had the most fun for the last eight years. Well, that will get you on Mt. Rushmore, won't it? Yeah! Yeah, I think I speak for all of the comedians when I say, you were the greatest! That was the golden egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Hillary Clinton appeared at a borders book store in Washington this week to sign copies of her new book. It's this book here, it's called 'An Invitation to the White House.' And President Clinton's written a book also. It's called 'We Don't Need to go to the White House, Let's do it Right Here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, President Clinton gave his opinion. President Clinton said that the Florida votes should be recounted, or -- this is a quote - 'America will be embarrassed in front of the world.' That's what he said. That's what he said. Wait. That's the serious part. . The President went on to say, 'Remember, embarrassing America in front of the world is my job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hundreds of people camped out overnight outside the Supreme Court hoping to be one of the few allowed inside to watch. Hundreds. Hundreds outside, just waiting. Yeah, yeah. Apparently, the crowd was made up of Democrats, Republicans and people who thought they were gonna see a Phish concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Supreme Court heard arguments from lawyers from Al Gore and lawyers for George W. Bush. That's what's happening. Unfortunately, some of the older Supreme Court justices got confused and accidentally ruled in favor of Pat Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that President Clinton has almost finished his memoirs. That's true. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. When asked about it, the President said, 'I'm almost done. I just need to find a few more synonyms for 'boinked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey: &quot;Yesterday afternoon, in a surprising decision, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Al Gore, calling for an immediate hand recount. This victory for Gore is regarded as the most shocking and ludicrous comeback since Bobby Ewing walked out of the shower on 'Dallas.'&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey: &quot;And today at 8:00 this morning, the hand recount started up again. Then the circuit court rejected Bush's appeal. The prime minister of Israel resigns. No one notices. Then this afternoon, the US Supreme Court got all up in it and stopped the recount. In light of these recent events, America is canceled. Citizens are asked to choose between Canada and Mexico by 4:00 PM tomorrow.&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: &quot;Earlier today, in a last-ditch effort to put an end to the election stalemate, Al Gore ate George W. Bush.&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey: &quot;On 'Meet the Press' last Sunday, Dick Cheney warned we may be on the edge of a recession. Governor Bush has since asked his running mate, 'If it's warm enough, can we have recession outside?'&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon: &quot;During an interview on '60 Minutes,' Al Gore denied he was angry about the election and said, what would the point of being angry be? Adding, 'Seriously, tell me, I am fascinated by your human emotions.'&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey: &quot;Following Cheney's mild heart attack last month, Beltway gossip suggested Cheney might be replaced on the Republican ticket. Insiders were concerned if Cheney were to die in office, then George W. Bush would be president.&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Fey: &quot;President Clinton granted a reprieve to Federal inmate Juan Raoul Garza, thereby postponing Garza's execution until next year, when it will be given to George W. Bush as a housewarming gift.&quot; (Saturday Night Live)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, let's see what's going on down there in south Florida, or as Al Gore calls it these days, 'Miami Vice!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see, the recent Supreme Court decision. Man, this is the worst news for Al Gore since -- the day before yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, things are going so well for George W. Bush today, he almost spoke for himself. Can you believe it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, George W. Bush has been privately telling friends that he's the President-elect. Of course, that could just be the whiskey talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said in the paper today that if Bush does win this thing, that Al Gore could still make a fortune in the private sector going around and giving motivational speeches at business conventions. Really? What kind of speeches would you give? 'How to almost be a winner.' Yeah. 'How to come this close.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let me ask you, is it me? Doesn't it feel like we're all in that movie 'Groundhog Day?' You know? You know, we are off for a week. We come back, it's the exact -- nothing has changed!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems we wake up, it's exactly the same as the day before. First, one court orders the recount to continue, then the other court calls off the recount. You know, that Ryder truck in Florida has circled the same area so much now, the driver was ticketed today under the anti-cruising law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember when you were a kid and you used to read about people in the old days? You used to think, 'Boy, people were really stupid back then. ' We're those people. . 'Back in the year 2000, people were really stupid. They didn't know how to punch a hole in a card.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And you know what's cool? These Supreme Court justices -- they're taking their time. They've got jobs for life. What do they care? Jobs for life -- kind of like Al Gore's legal team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The US Supreme Court today heard oral arguments from both sides. Although Clinton spoke out about it. He said, 'An oral argument isn't really an argument.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton now saying that if the Florida votes aren't recounted, America will be embarrassed in front of the world. Ho-ho, and you know how Clinton would hate to embarrass America in front of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I think I figured out where the whole voting thing went wrong in Florida. It was back in 1845 when we voted to let them into the union, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And former President George Bush Sr. just underwent hip replacement surgery at the Mayo Clinic. See, he's pretty smart. He wanted to get that done before his kid's health care plan went into effect and he could no longer afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The good news is, former President Bush is doing fine and recovering very well. I guess he injured his hip when he and his other son, Jeb Bush, were carrying heavy boxes of uncounted ballots into the woods in Florida to bury them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And while we were off last week, Senator Strom Thurmond celebrated his 98th birthday. Woo! What a party that was, huh? I understand they had a registered nurse jump out of a giant bran muffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But big storm in the Midwest. Did you see this in the news today? 22 inches of snow in Chicago. 22 inches, although it is not official. Apparently not all the flakes have been counted yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And no news yet on the Supreme Court. Take your time. Don't worry, fellas, what's the hurry? Nice thing about having a job for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's my question about the whole Supreme Court thing -- what if one of these Supreme Court justices -- and they're quite elderly, some of them -- what if one of them intended to vote for Gore and accidentally voted for Bush? Does it start all over again? Do we then go to the Federation of Planets? Is that how it works? Spock's father will come in?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you haven't picked out a Christmas present yet for Al Gore, you can't go wrong with some moving boxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Not looking good for Gore. Lost two more cases today. This afternoon, he called the judge in Florida asking if he can borrow the Ryder rental truck to move back to Tennessee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, one of the issues the Supreme Court's considering -- this is interesting -- is there were no standards when coming to counting votes. Apparently there were no standards. All of a sudden, we're concerned about standards. If we had any standards, these two guys wouldn't have been the candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that one Bush lawyer, Joseph Klock, I think his name was? He was so nervous, he kept getting the names of the justices wrong. He kept getting their names wrong. Couldn't remember their names. He's not only representing Bush, he's becoming Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of George Bush's chief campaign aides said there's a quiet serenity about him. Bush has a reassuring calmness. Calmness, really? I mean, Bush admits he doesn't read the paper every day and his ranch doesn't have a TV set. He doesn't have a TV or a newspaper. That's not serenity, that's not calmness. I don't think he has any idea what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, I can understand why Bush might be calm. This is the first time he's been in court where there's no breathalyzer involved. Thank God for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess today down there in Texas, they started moving some of Governor Bush's stuff out of the governor's mansion to get ready for the, you know, transition to Washington. . They moved some of his personal effects today. There it is there.&quot; (A clip of a forklift moving a pallet of Budweiser was shown.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Meanwhile, where is President Clinton? President Clinton now in Northern Ireland. Clinton spoke for the need to unite Ireland. Unite Ireland? Hey, we can't even unite Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And more problems for Clinton today when he was over in Ireland. He not only kissed the Blarney Stone, he slipped it the tongue. ... Now the stone's suing him for sexual harassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the White House announced today that the President and Hillary Clinton will visit the royal family at Buckingham Palace in England. That should make President Clinton feel at home for Arkansas, don't you think? Three generations of a family living in the same house with bad teeth. That's got to bring back memories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some of Clinton's old buddies like Susan McDougal and that junk bond king Michael Milken calling on Clinton to pardon them. They want pardons before Clinton leaves office. How about pardoning Bush and Cheney? They've got five arrests between them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Officials in the toy industry -- this is the first Christmas in modern history there's no hot toy, no Elmo, no Beanie Baby, no Teletubby, not one toy all the kids agree on. See what we've done in this country? We've now created an entire fashion of little undecided voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's 5:30 right now. We don't know what's going on. So I'll do the best I can. In fact, if they do announce who's president tonight, I'll probably get bumped off the air by Tom Brokaw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Republican leaders say if things go their way -- if things go their way, they're hoping Al Gore will make a concession speech tonight. That's what they're saying. Yeah, which is really historic. . Think about it, folks. That is historic. It marks the first time anyone's ever wanted Al Gore to make a speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A lot of Americans, apparently, according to polls, are concerned that no matter who is declared the winner of the election, half the country will not accept the new president. That's what they're saying. Yeah, and when asked about it, George W. Bush said, 'I am confident the country will see me as legitable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a famous astrologer in Washington, DC, the next president of the US will be Al Gore. That's what the astrologer said. Yeah, originally, the astrologer said George W. Bush, but Gore demanded she recount her tarot cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton and the prime minister of Ireland stopped in a pub for a couple of beers. That's true, they did that. Apparently, President Clinton had a few too many because he was overheard telling him, 'You know, buddy, you're starting to look good to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm glad you folks are here because, quite honestly, last night the audience -- really a rough crowd. Three of my jokes were reversed. And then they went to go scream outside the Supreme Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, God bless him, he ain't paying attention to this at all. Yesterday, he goes to the gym. He's less interested in this than I am.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney is very busy. He's taking things very seriously. As a matter of fact, until this is resolved Dick Cheney has rescheduled all of his heart attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Has anybody seen Al Gore lately? I mean the guy has turned into a balloon. Honest to God, he's getting huge. Like a month ago he was fine, it was, 'There's Al Gore.' And now it's, 'Who are those guys? Oh, I see, it's the Vice President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore got on the scales this morning and demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton classic joke we originally told on the show December 20, 1999. . President Clinton sprained his back today, but don't worry about him. Right now he's in the West Wing of the White House packed in hot interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Supreme Court held the country hostage for an entire day while they deliberated over who will be president. . A court spokesman said the delay is normal when you have the added distraction of two hotties like Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Ladies, turn off that sexy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Meanwhile, George W. Bush has become so frustrated with the delay he's threatened to hold his breath until he is proclaimed the winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton and his family arrived in Ireland today to partake in continued peace talks and the 'Fake Marriage Olympics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary later said she was pleased to be in Ireland instead of England where she keeps getting mistaken for Stonehenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Wake up, America. It's finally over! The big story, Gilligan beat the Professor!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell ya, I haven see George W. Bush this happy since his daddy got him into the National Guard, woo! Missed that Vietnam thing by that much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, I guess Governor Bush no longer called Governor. Can't call him Governor anymore. Now you call him the luckiest man in the world!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, did you hear the latest? The latest is he might not become President. Not over. No, no. Apparently, it seems everyone who works at the White House has to take a drug test first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But George W. Bush has announced that given the circumstances and all that went on, it will be a dignified inauguration. He said a simple swearing-in ceremony at noon on January 20th followed by a toga party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The first day was a busy day for George W. Bush today. He spent the whole morning at the mall Christmas shopping for five of the Supreme Court justices!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Judge Clarence Thomas did not ask a single question. Not one question. I guess he's too busy watching his Coke can to make sure nobody put anything on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know it shows how old I am, boy. I can remember the good old days when the president picked the Supreme Court justices instead of the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You think late last night Al Gore was sitting up going, 'I got a good idea, it's not too late to impeach Clinton. I'll become president that way. Let's get a recount. Yeah, that's it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Al Gore also gave his speech tonight. A lot of people say he should have bowed out sooner. That's where he and President Clinton differ. See, Clinton knows when he's been licked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, a lot of people felt that Al Gore's biggest mistake was looking unnatural in the debates. They thought he looked unnatural. And telling those exaggerated stories. So basically: too much makeup and trying to make up too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The good news, Al Gore's been offered a new job. Bad news, president of Oldsmobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But Gore said today he will return to the private sector. He will spend the next four years teaching people in Florida how to poke holes in pieces of paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, Florida got a black eye in this thing, didn't they? . Boy, they're paying the -- did you hear the latest thing in Florida now? They're not going to be allowed to vote in next month's People's Choice awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, I want to congratulate our own NBC News network. Boy, they announced five weeks ago Bush was the winner. We were ahead of our time. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I was watching the coverage of the Supreme Court hearings last night on MSNBC. That's one of our sister things. So I didn't watch CNN, I wasn't watching ABC. I'm a loyal NBC guy. I'm on NBC, they pay my check, I'm gonna watch MSNBC. Anyway, I'm watching Pat Cadell on MSNBC. Take a look. Here he is. There he is talking. Look, see what people (in the background of the MSNBC studio) are watching? They're watching the Drew Carey show, 'Whose Line is it Anyway?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Meanwhile, President Clinton in Ireland now trying to bring the Protestants and the Catholics together. His wife Hillary accompanying on the trip there. I guess Clinton wanted to show the Irish if he and Hillary can live together, anybody can do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There was one kind of embarrassing moment yesterday. I guess President Clinton visited a brewery and had a little too much Guinness. In fact, he had so much, he accidentally hit on Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You can tell the Christmas season is here. In fact, today in Texas, they just started executing elves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore will address the nation at 9:00 to concede the election. And at 10:00, George W. Bush will address the nation to accept the presidency. Yeah. Then -- there's more. There's more. Then at 11:00, Al Gore will address the nation again, withdraw his concession and file ten more lawsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore apparently went to bed last night without telling his aides -- without telling his aides whether he would concede, and reportedly, he thought about the decision all night long. That's what they're saying in the papers today. In fact, they say the only way Gore could finally fall asleep was by recounting sheep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush says that now that he's President-elect, his first job will be to unify the country. That's what he said, which I thought that was very nice. Yeah, then Bush said his second job will be to figure out how they build those model ships inside those tiny bottles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In an appearance today on C-Span.Clarence Thomas told several high school students that politics had zero influence on any Supreme Court decision. That's what Clarence Thomas said. Yeah, and the high school kids pretended to believe Thomas because he promised to buy them beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton has been offered $8 million to write her memoirs. $8 million. Yeah, not only that, President Clinton has offered her $10 million not to write them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I want to take a second here to thank the members of the Supreme Court. You folks really cleared up that mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;By the way, Florida, do us a favor. Stay out of the next election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;For the last month there have been like 10,000 attorneys down there in Florida. And what a nightmare today for American Airlines. All those lawyers trying to book seats in 'Shyster Class.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But life goes on. By noon today, James Baker was back on the first tee of his restricted country club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Thank God this thing is over. You know Tim Russert, over there at NBC with the pad and the grease pencil? He's running out of things to do with the grease pencil, and last night, it was about 11:00, he drew kind of an amusing caricature of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush is very excited. He's already working on his first foreign policy blunder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's been very busy writing his inauguration speech. . And I understand it's lengthy. . Insiders say it's about 12 cocktail napkins long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton Classic joke was originally told August 7, 2000. . Al Gore has selected Senator Joe Lieberman to be his running mate. Lieberman would be the first Jewish person to serve directly under a president since, well...since Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What a crowd, boy. What a crowd. Man. You sound like death- row inmates in Texas when you heard Bush was leaving the state, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Old habits die hard. It's funny with Bush. Now whenever the Secret Service knocks on the door, he keeps flushing stuff down the toilet.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what was weird about Al Gore? When his campaign was alive, his makeup made him look dead. Now that his campaign is dead, the man looked alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Gore referred to Bush as the President-elect, and Gore said that he would be 'my President, too.' You get the feeling when Gore refers to Bush as 'my President,' it's the same feeling when Hillary refers to Bill as 'my husband?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think Bush is still in shock that he won. He looks like a guy who has to keep checking his lotto numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, the 'Quayle in the headlight' look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you think Al Gore's bitter? Yeah, I think he's a little -- I think he's kind of bitter. Like, today, they caught him swiping office supplies at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I'll bet Al Gore's family is secretly glad this thing is over. They can finally stop playing touch football on the lawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Bush people have already begun working on the big inaugural party. I don't know who they'll get to entertain. I think we can rule out Barbara Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's hard finding entertainers for Bush, because all the big entertainers were for Gore, you saw how effective that was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, they got Bon Jovi -- who else does Gore have? Springsteen, everybody. So far, the only person who is a Republican to sing for them is Roger Clinton. That's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, President-elect Bush also gave a speech last night. He said he'll use the military experience he learned in the National Guard to help him as President. So I guess he'll be commander-in-chief one weekend a month and then two weeks during the summer, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I saw Al Gore here today. Did you see Al Gore here today? He was on the lot here at NBC, yeah. He was reading for a part on 'West Wing.' Bad thing was, he didn't get it. Not convincing enough. Too stiff, too wooden, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, I don't know what Al Gore's going to do next. I think we can rule out taking a vacation in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And now Republicans are saying we should fix the voting machines in Florida. Oh, sure, now they say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They say we should fix them to make sure that in the future every vote is counted. Seems like a lot of trouble, doesn't it? I figure as long as the Supreme Court is fixed, you don't need to fix the voting machines. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton admitted to Rolling Stone -- he's in Rolling Stone. He had an interview. He said if it wasn't for the 22nd Amendment, he would run for president again. He said he would run for president again, but he can't because of the 22nd Amendment. So I guess to Clinton amendments are more important than commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like another scandal brewing with President Clinton. Did you hear about this? Remember, on Tuesday I mentioned how when President Clinton was in Ireland, he kissed the Blarney Stone. Turns out it now has herpes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The bidding for Hillary Clinton's memoirs now up to $7 million. In the book, she promises to talk candidly about Bill. . In fact, we have an advance copy of the book here. . This is the actual book. It's called, 'When you're done with her, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Police in Kennedy, Texas, are now searching for seven inmates who escaped from prison. See, actually, they don't escape. This is how Texans conserve electricity. You let a few go free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In his speech last night, everyone's talking about it, Al Gore said that he has no idea what he's gonna do now. That's what he said. Yeah, and not surprisingly, during his speech, George W. Bush said the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Secret Service announced that President-elect George W. Bush's new code name is 'Tumbler.' That's his code name. And not only that, they announced that Dick Cheney's new code name is 'Quick, call 911.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today, George W. Bush said that he's looking forward to working with Senator Hillary Clinton. Said he's looking forward to working with her. Yeah, fortunately, Hillary's used to being lied to by the President. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In his speech last night, Al Gore made a little joke. Al Gore said that he called George W. Bush to concede, and this time Gore didn't call back. That's what he said. Yeah. Gore admitted he did, however, drive by Bush's house and throw a brick through the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I want to apologize for being a little late tonight. Man, I was in line for three hours today at Kinkos. I got stuck behind Al Gore running off copies of his resume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But good news today for Al Gore -- they say he might be in a position to become president of a major university. Bad news, it's Devry Institute.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in his acceptance speech the other night, President barely- elect, George W. Bush -- he asked all Americans to pray for him, which seems a little greedy to me. Huh? I mean, the other guy got more votes. He still won the election. Hey, you already got a miracle, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess the transition work is starting in Washington. Most of the focus right now on White House appointments. Colin Powell's getting one. He's going to be secretary of state. Andrew Card, Dick Cheney, maybe Christie Todd Whitman from New Jersey. Even some Democrats -- listen to this - - will get assignments in the White House. The only person 100% assured not of having any responsibility is George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But they said today, the inauguration will be a modest party. Some of the celebrities going to attend with George W. Bush, they released today -- Mickey Rooney, Charlton Heston, Brooke Shields. Sounds more like an old Bob Hope Christmas show, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, aren't you glad this election is finally over? Now you can get back to Christmas again. You know, now we can go back to the simpler times -- when a dimple was something on your face. Remember that? When recount was something you did to your change at McDonald's. When dangling chad was just another friend of Richard Simmons'. Those were the simple days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the USA Today yesterday, they printed a little biography on our new First Lady, Laura Bush. Do you know she's a librarian by profession? Does anybody know that? That's what she does. Yeah, she's a professional librarian. Now I don't know where she and George Bush first met, but I think we can pretty much rule out the library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said on the news tonight that Bush could have the first presidential library with all books on tape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And all the political pundits now, they keep speculating on how hard it's going to be for Al Gore to leave Washington, how tough it's going to be Let me tell you something, Al Gore is going to be fine. You know what's going to be tough? Clinton. Dragging him out of there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton will be rigging the White House like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton will use squatters' rights to stay in there. You're not going to get him out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton now offered almost $8 million -- it was $7 million yesterday -- now up to $8 million for a book of her memoirs, but only if she discusses her husband's affairs. If she discusses her husband's affairs in the book, they'll give her $8 million. And here's something I thought was nice. Today President Clinton said he'd offer to cheat again just to try and get the price up a little bit for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in interview in Rolling Stone magazine, President Clinton said he's looking forward to flying commercial again. He wants to fly commercial instead of using Air Force One. You know why? Two words -- flight attendants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And earlier today, the final steps were taken in the $111 billion AOL- Time Warner merger. Isn't that amazing? They say it's the largest corporate merger in history not counting the Bush-Cheney ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Secret Service announced yesterday -- this is true -- that George W. Bush's new code name is Tumbler. That's his name, Tumbler. That's right, yeah, the Secret Service said they had to use Tumbler for George W. because Bumbler had already been taken by Dan Quayle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At a church service attended by George W. Bush, the minister speaking compared George W. to Moses. That's what he said. That's a true story. Yeah, yeah, not because George W. has been chosen the leader of his people, but because like Moses, he was lost for 40 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;After his concession speech this week, Al Gore threw a wild party -- this is true. And he hung out until 3:00 in the morning with guests like Tom Petty and Jon Bon Jovi. That's what the press said. Yeah, apparently Gore had Petty and Bon Jovi there because he likes to party like it's 1989.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This week, reporters asked President Clinton what his plans are for after he leaves office. And Clinton said, 'I want' -- this is a quote - 'I want to do something dear to my heart that I'm passionate about.' Yeah. In other words, he wants to do Alyssa Milano.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The number two movie is the new film 'Dude, Where's My Car?' It's all about George W. Bush's college years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did some Christmas shopping on E-bay. Yeah, I bought Al Gore's lockbox, 15 bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, it's tough losing, isn't it? You got to feel sorry for Al Gore, no matter which side you're on. You notice now, even the Democrats are starting to distance themselves from him. Like, today, Gore called up Joe Lieberman and said, 'Hey, let's have lunch.' Lieberman said, 'I got to pick up a Christmas tree for the kids. I got to run.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Got to give Bush credit, though. You see his appointees? Did pretty good. So far Bush has named two African-Americans, a white guy and a Hispanic. A lot of diversity. So we know he's at least not the President of a TV network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot; Give Bush credit. Bush has now named more black people in his Administration than voted for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush said today he wanted to show he didn't have to be able to pronounce diverse to apply it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Secret Service finally given a code name to George W. Bush. It's Tumbler. That's the real code name. Why do they tell people the code name anyway?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, you know the first name they considered? This is true - - Einstein. No, no, I think that's a much smarter choice. Think about that. If they're talking on the phone and people are trying to figure out who Einstein is, (Bush is) the last person you're going to think of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton met with incoming First Lady Laura Bush at the White House. They had tea. That must have been lovely. Actually, Laura Bush has something in common with Hillary Clinton. She also has no idea what her husband is doing in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the Drudge Report, which I guess had it first, NBC is in discussions with President Clinton about developing his own talk show for the network. This is true. . Isn't this unbelievable? The show will be something like Tim Russert. You know 'Meet the Press?' Except with Clinton, it will be called 'Press the Meat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton is back from his trip to Ireland and England. While over there, he visited Buckingham Palace. While he was looking at Prince Charles, he kept saying to himself, 'Man, what I wouldn't give for an intern with a pair of ears like that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, our president, is Time magazine's 'Man of the Year.' Al Gore, when he heard about this, demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You buy Time magazine, and you see George W. Bush on the cover with his 'Man of the Year' caught-in-the-headlights look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, though -- all kidding aside -- he had a pretty busy day. He met with congressional leaders. He stopped by the White House, took a look around there. He went to see, 'Dude, where's my car?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You got to give him credit. He's selecting cabinet members now, and he's really reaching out. His new attorney general is Della Reese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So far in the cabinet, George W. Bush has selected two women. Two important positions -- he's selected two women for those positions.  But to be fair, nobody has put women in more positions, I think, than President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you ready for tonight's Clinton Classic? Originally told December 28, 1999. . President Clinton gave Al Gore a 'Big Mouth Billy Bass' for Christmas. Coincidentally, that's what Bill's been using since Monica left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President-elect George W. Bush has begun putting together his cabinet. He named Colin Powell as secretary of state, and Condoleezza Rice as another person to stop Bush from looking like a jack-ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;He wants all the appointments made by January so he can begin the serious work of memorizing their names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Then he met with Alan Greenspan to discuss economics. Greenspan uttered the phrase, 'Use your spoon, stupid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Greenspan then gave Bush a lesson in economics by taking $500 from him in a game of three-card monte.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Russian President Putin arrived in Canada yesterday with his wife. Putin is in Canada to share information about drunken hockey players living in a miserable climate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nick Cage has got this new movie called Family Man, it's about a guy who's living and enjoying the single life. He's got the girls. He's got the cars. He's got the money. Then he wakes up one day, boom, and he has this family. Today, President Clinton called it the scariest movie of the year!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the big story is -- I guess you heard about this -- Hillary Clinton getting $8 million. That's like one of the highest ever -- $8 million to write about her life in the White House, including all of Bill's affairs. Well, actually, she can't write about all of his affairs, or else it would turn into one of those Time Life series books. You know, where you get one a month for 88 months, you know how that works.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But apparently, she will also discuss Bill's affair with Monica Lewinsky. And I understand the chapter on Monica - little catty. Yeah. In fact, that chapter's called, 'A Double Wide is not Just a Trailer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems when incoming First Lady Laura Bush arrived at the White House yesterday, she couldn't get out of the limo, because the door was frozen shut. Couldn't get out. Frozen shut. Apparently, Hillary Clinton had been staring at her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush in the New York Times holding hands?. Look, there they are. There they are holding hands. And this is an old habit of Hillary's. See, every time a new woman visits the White House, Hillary grabs her hand to make sure they can't escape and go into the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, I guess there was one embarrassing moment with the two First Ladies. I guess Laura Bush was trying to find things they have in common, you know. And I guess she said to Hillary, 'Oh, it must be so exciting to suddenly wake up in bed next to the President of the US.' And then she realized, 'Oh, Hillary's probably never done that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, the two First Ladies wound up having tea together. And later in the day, George Bush visited President Clinton in the Oval Office, where they had some t and a. So apparently they had a nice time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I love that look on Gore's face (when he met George W. Bush). See that look, that smile? He looks like the guy in the constipation commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush can't win. They keep picking on him. Now, he's appointed so far two African Americans and two Hispanics to his cabinet, and now the Democrats are accusing him of racial profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what Bush's Secret Service code name is? I don't know why the Secret Service gives out the code name. But his code name is Tumbler. That's his actual code name. You know what Dick Cheney's Secret Service code name is? 'Clear!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There was an article in USA Today about George Bush's body language. And they said when he's annoyed, he narrows his eyes, and when he's tired, his face sags a little bit. And then they said when he's happy, he kind of lifts his shoulders -- you see that thing where he lifts his shoulders and tilts his head a little bit? They didn't say what he does when he's in deep thought, because apparently that hasn't happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There were reports that after he leaves office and moves to New York, President Clinton wants to do a weekly TV show. They already have Sex and the City, isn't that on now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier today, in all the news, George W. Bush met with President Clinton at the White House and they had lunch together. Isn't that nice? They got together and had lunch. Yes. Yeah, Bush said that he'd eaten at the White House when his dad was president, but this was the first time he got to sit at the grown-ups' table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This week, important announcement. George W. Bush announced that his nominee for national security adviser is Condoleezza Rice. That's right, yeah. And when George W. made the announcement, he said the 'Rice' part, and Dick Cheney said the 'Condoleezza' part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Sam Donaldson says that it's correct to address George W. Bush as 'Governor,' and it's not correct to address him as 'President-elect.' That's according to Sam Donaldson. Yeah, and in a related story, Bush says it's correct to address Donaldson as 'Mr. Yak-hair.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a new poll that just came out, a majority of Americans think that Al Gore will win if he faces off against George W. Bush in the 2004 election. That's what they say. Of course, they don't think Gore will become president, they just think he'll win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: (Tuesday's taping was broadcast to US service members in Tuzla, Bosnia.) &quot;Here's the makeup of the folks in Tuzla: 85% male, 15% female. That's also how they described Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We had a great election, and I don't know if you folks in Bosnia, I don't know if you heard about the election. We have a new president, and it went very smoothly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, it must be very confidence-building to know that the new president not only could not find this place, but cannot pronounce it, as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush was down in Washington earlier today meeting with President Clinton. It was very, very touching, very moving. Clinton turned over the keys to the interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody here is all caught up in the holiday festivities, even President Clinton. He was decorating the office. Earlier today, he was hanging the mistletoe under his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Santa Claus stopped by the White House today, met with President Clinton. See that in the news? See, Santa does that every year, to pick up a list of all the girls who have been naughty. Apparently Clinton's list is much more accurate and up-to-date. He always has a few names on there that Santa may have missed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And New York Senator Hillary Clinton's $8 million book deal, drawing a lot of criticism. Yeah. See, that's one good thing about George W. Bush, we know he won't be writing any books.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, Bush, now that the election's over, of course, turns to focusing on holiday season. Notice he dropped his normal 'deer in the headlight' look, now he's going with the more festive 'reindeer in the headlight look.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Diversity, still the key to the Bush cabinet. Got to give them credit there, got to give them credit. To give you an idea of how diverse he's getting -- you see who appointed surgeon general today? See who he made surgeon general? Dr. Dre. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, so far, Bush has appointed two African Americans and two Hispanics to his Cabinet. See, that makes sense. Bush grew up in a wealthy family, and I guess he's used to having minorities do all the actual work around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know Jesse's going, 'Good one, Jay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President-elect Bush met privately with Vice President Gore yesterday, for 15 minutes, inside the Vice President's home. You know, finally, Bush just told Gore outright, he said, 'Look, you know, I'm really not interested in any Amway products, but thanks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman gave George W. Bush an early Christmas present today, gave him an 11-week-old Scottish Terrier. Nice little dog. You realize this puppy will probably leave fewer stains on the carpet than Clinton did?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, George W. Bush met with Clinton at the White House. You see that fake smile on Clinton's face? He's sitting there talking. You know that fake smile Clinton gives? Usually only see that when Hillary's talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the Drudge Report, they say -- and again, this has not been denied, and I heard it here on NBC, because that's who he's been talking to -- there's reports that after he leaves office, President Clinton might get his own TV talk show. See, the format will be a little different than this one. Like, on his talk show, the guests will be under the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think it's going to be called 'Touched by a President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to today's 'Washington Post,' Bill and Hillary Clinton house- hunting again. They're selling the house in New York. That's what they said. They just bought that. You don't think they did that just to get elected?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a search committee has nominated Al Gore to be the new president of Harvard University. How about that? Don't hold your breath. There's an election involved. You know how Al does in those things. Even when he wins, he seems to get screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, President Clinton ruled out becoming a mayor or a governor when he leaves office, but this is the interesting part. He did not rule out becoming a judge. True story. In fact, the President expressed interest in becoming a judge in both the Miss America and the Miss Universe pageant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day, this is pretty serious. A man was arrested outside George W. Bush's Texas ranch because police found several guns in his car. Yeah. And the surprising part is, the man was Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the market -- oh, man, it's been not a good week for the stock market. Man, I tell you, it dropped faster than that phony smile on Al Gore's face after George Bush left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't want to panic people about the economy, but today Alan Greenspan took a second job just in case.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier this afternoon, George W. Bush resigned as the Governor of Texas. Yeah. And you know, this is historic. It's historic, the first time he's ever left a job without going bankrupt first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The state of Texas was terrific to him. In fact, I understand while he's President, they're still going to let him come by every once in a while and execute somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Bush named his Treasury Secretary, businessman Paul O'Neill, the Chairman of Alcoa, you know, the aluminum can company. They make all the aluminum cans. Bush said he got the idea to hire the Alcoa guy driving around listening to all the empties rattling around in his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it was bound to happen. I told you this would happen. I knew it. I didn't think it would be so soon, I thought it would be closer to tomorrow or Monday. But it's official. Earlier today George W. Bush ran out of black Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like there's a new first dog coming to the White House, too. Not a bad intern joke. An actual dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush has accepted a little 11-week-old Scottish Terrier puppy, a present from New Jersey Governor Christy Todd Whitman. That's kind of an Oval Office tradition, there's always someone on all fours at any given time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, earlier this week, Bush met with Al Gore -- I mentioned that earlier, at the Vice Presidential mansion. They only talked for 16 minutes. He drives over there. They talk 16 minutes. Even bill and Hillary talk longer than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest rumor is once President Clinton leaves office, he may host a weekly news show. I think it's going to be called, 'Whose Wife is it Anyway?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton should do a show like 'Crossfire.' You know, one of those shows where you have the liberal and the conservative debating, because as often as Clinton changes position, he could play both parts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today NASA announced they plan to send a robot -- a robot to explore the planet Pluto. See, I knew something would open up for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush formally resigned as Governor of Texas. He resigned. Yeah. Yeah, the people of Texas thanked Bush for his service and as a going away present, they let him execute 15 people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush will probably -- probably select New Jersey Governor Christy Todd Whitman to head the Environmental Protection Agency. . And Governor Whitman said, if she gets the job to protect the environment, the first thing she'll do is close down New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is the shortest day of the year. . Today is so short, today down in Washington, DC President Clinton only had time to squeeze in six interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We are now in the final month of the Clinton Administration. I haven't felt this way since Giuliani closed down all the sex shops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton Classic joke (was) originally told on this program Sept. 23, 1998. . Here is tonight's Clinton Classic joke: Democrats are accusing Republicans of putting words into Monica Lewinsky's mouth. Well, so what? Everything else has been in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Most of the East Coast will be hit by ice and snow this weekend. Several teams of paramedics standing by in Washington in case Dick Cheney tries to shovel his driveway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Terrible weather all across the country. See that in Arkansas this week? I guess electricity was knocked out because of the storm. 300,000 houses without electricity. In fact, in Little Rock, Arkansas, so dark last night someone actually hit on Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like the Clintons have bought a new home in Washington, DC -- $3.5 million home. Looks like they're going to be selling their home in Chappaqua, New York. How sad. So many memories. You know, they spent over three nights in that home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More Cabinet appointments. George W. Bush has chosen Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson. I think he can be Thomas now, okay? Tommy Thompson. well, he's going to be the new Health Secretary. That's a good idea, putting a guy from the cheese state in charge of (Health).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see. First, Bush put someone from New Jersey in charge of cleaning up the environment. Then you got someone from the cheese state in charge of health. Who's going to be the new drug czar? Hey, how about a guy from Colombia?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A woman from Zimbabwe arrested smuggling drugs. She was smuggling drugs. She was arrested at the airport after someone noticed -- a customs official actually -- noticed a suspiciously large butt. Turns out she had 14 pounds of marijuana stuffed in her underwear. . This proves what Nancy Reagan was saying 20 years ago. Marijuana leads to crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to this month's issue of Men's Health magazine, after four drinks the average man is unable to perform sexually. You think that's true? You think four drinks can kill your sex drive, huh? Why are there so many people named Kennedy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President-elect George W. Bush -- this is interesting -- he made four more appointments to his Cabinet today, but he still has a few more to go. He's got quite a few still more to go. And unfortunately, George W. has run out of people to appoint because the rest of his dad's friends have passed away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;We're supposed to get up to 15 inches of snow. 15 inches. Amazing. True. Yeah, it's interesting. Senator Hillary Clinton says she's never seen it snow that much in all the years she's lived in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I feel good about the New Year. I'm optimistic. We have a new President, new jokes that will be good. No, but it's got to be hard for other people, or people in other countries rather, to follow our system of government. You know, the people voted for Gore to do it, and then the courts said, 'No, no Bush should do it,' then Bush said, 'No, no Cheney you do it. I'm not doing it.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today President Clinton met with Yasser Arafat at the White House. Arafat flew over here on PLO airlines. Really. What kind of security do they have? Like, do they stop you if you don't have a gun? 'I'm sorry, sir, you must have at least one bomb in the overhead compartment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Clinton wants to achieve peace in the Middle East before he leaves office. Oh yeah, we only had war there for 10,000 years. I'm sure the long weekend, we should wrap this up pretty quick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The new list is out for the most admired man in America, and it's a tie between Bill Clinton and the Pope. Did you see this today? I'm not lying, right? The Pope ties Bill Clinton as the most admired man. How do you think this makes the Pope feel? He's sitting in the Vatican going, 'What do I got to do to beat this guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I guess they've both been celibate for the last year. So that's not too bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton or the Pope, what do you think? See, whichever one you favor decides on whether you want to forgive sin or commit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, according to a CNN poll today, Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America. How about that? . Women admire her because she's strong and successful and men admire her because she lets her husband cheat and get away with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Clintons have bought another home. They got like, I guess, a kind of a 'his and her' thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This one is in Washington, DC. They paid something like $3 million, six bedroom home, very upscale neighborhood. I guess they looked at a lot of houses. And the realtor said on TV today, the toughest part was finding a house in Washington where Clinton had not already seen the bedroom. 'Been there. Seen that. Been there, seen that. Been there, done that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is this week's issue of Newsweek. . This is a full-page ad for Viagra. Do you see what it says? Look at the ad. Get up in the corner. It says.in the rare event of an erection lasting more than four hours.did you hear of Lou Gehrig's disease? Apparently, this is Bill Clinton disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Yasser Arafat called President Clinton to set up an urgent meeting. Fascinating. An urgent meeting. This is big. Yeah, the President was overheard telling Arafat, 'Urgent, oh, my God, don't tell me you're pregnant.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a new study in the Medical Journal -- this is true -- cocaine use is linked to heart attack. That's what they say. That's right. Yeah, and after hearing this, George W. Bush said, 'So Cheney has been dipping into my stash.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A recent study from the University of Buffalo says if couples want to get along better they should get a dog or a cat. Do you think that works? Think that helps you get along better? Think it does? Yeah, yeah, yeah? The Clintons have a dog and a cat, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And all the new senators were sworn in today, including Hillary Clinton. A very historic day. There was one awkward moment when Hillary was asked which state she represented and she had to look at her driver's license. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the USA Today/CNN poll, Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II have tied for the most admired man in America. I love this story. You think Al Gore wanted a recount, how about the Pope?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, basically, there are two camps, women admire the Pope for his religious conviction. And men who admired Clinton for his interpretation of the Pope's religious conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard by now the Clintons bought a new home in Washington. That's a big story this week. Already controversy over that. The real estate agent said it has six bedrooms and Clinton said, no, it has only five bedrooms. Apparently, there's a hideaway bedroom off the office. He doesn't want Hillary to know about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President-almost-elect Bush has finally finished putting his Cabinet together. I got to give him credit, he's really trying to prove that his cabinet is culturally diverse. That's his big thing, diversity. In fact, he doesn't even call it his Cabinet, he calls it his posse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to Egyptian intelligence, like their CIA people, they say Saddam Hussein may have had a stroke and may even be dead. Nobody knows yet. This is unbelievable. And if President Hussein is dead, his successor would be his son. How what kind of political system do they have? Just because the father is president, the son gets to be president, too? Have you ever heard of something so stupid? Thank God our system does not work that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what his son's name is? George W. Hussein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, he and George W. Bush had a lot to talk about. 'My dad beat your dad in the war.' 'Nuh-uh. My dad was President for 20 years. Your dad was only President for four years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today, just after she was sworn in as a Senator, Hillary Clinton received a hug and a kiss from 98-year-old Senator Strom Thurmond. Isn't that sweet? Very nice. The weird thing is, not only did Thurmond hug and kiss Hillary, he also whispered in her ear, 'I love you, Betsy Ross.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Fox Network has a new show premiering next week called 'Temptation Island.' Have you heard about this stupid thing? Well, the concept is, they take four seriously committed couples and they throw them together with 26 young, attractive singles to see if they'll cheat. It's more like 'Bill Clinton, the Home Game.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Clintons have purchased a $2.8 million mansion in Washington. They don't have any furniture for it yet. But you know those two lovebirds, all they need is a bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;When you think about it, after eight years in the White House and the Governor's mansion in Arkansas, the Clintons don't really own any furniture. In fact, Bill said the only thing he's going to bring with him from the White House is his lucky desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Hillary Clinton was sworn in as Senator from New York.  This is pretty historic. And today, on the Senate floor, she introduced her first bill, it calls for a mandatory death penalty for anyone who commits adultery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After Hillary was sworn in, 98-year-old Strom Thurmond gave her a big bear hug and gave her a kiss on the cheek. And here's the scary part, that's the most action either of them has gotten in eight years, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;CBS has announced the contestants for 'Survivor 2.' It's in Australia. It's called 'Survivor: Down Under.' Sounds more like 'The Monica Lewinsky Show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the competitors on the next Survivor show include an Army intelligence officer and two bartenders, which make it sound more like Bush's new security council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President barely-elect Bush has finished putting together his Cabinet. Have you seen his Cabinet, he's got this Norm Mineta guy who is 69. He has got Donald Rumsfeld who is 68. He has got Paul O'Neill who is 65. When Bush promised to improve the financial well-being of the elderly, I didn't realize he was going to do it by giving them all jobs on his Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the US Drug Czar, Barry McCaffrey, stepped down. Why not? He did a wonderful job. Thank God that drug thing has cleared up. Hey, don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Secret Service says that they have already taken precautions for George W. Bush's inaugural parade. Do you believe that? They've already taken a lot of precautions. Yeah, and apparently, the biggest precaution they're taking is attaching George W.'s mittens to his coat sleeves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A very big celebration for Senator Hillary Clinton's swearing-in is gonna be held in New York late Sunday afternoon. And some people are upset because it's happening at the same time as the Giants playoff game. Yeah, some people are bummed about it. Yeah, when asked about it, Hillary said, 'So what? Who cares about the San Francisco Giants?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Lovely here in California. But back East, man -- whoo. See that snow in DC? The President's helicopter couldn't even land. In fact, it's so cold in Washington, Dick Cheney had to use his heart defibrillator to jump- start his car.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In just two weeks, Bill Clinton will no longer be President of the US. Hey -- hard to believe, yeah. Well, think of that, I mean -- he'll just be another chubby, middle-aged guy annoying the waitresses at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of all the foreign leaders that the Pope has met with, the only one who wasn't paying attention, didn't listen to the Pope, was Bill Clinton. Duh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But the White House today denied it. They said, no, he paid attention to at least nine of the Ten Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Pope didn't like Clinton. And when you think about that -- I mean, it's the Pope. He even sat down with the guy who shot him, come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, more bad news for Al Gore. Harvard's presidential search committee -- remember they said Al Gore might become President of Harvard? Now they said, no, they're not gonna name him president. Here's the sad part. Gore got more votes than anybody else, and they still gave it to someone else. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But Al Gore said yesterday, in two weeks when he leaves Washington, he will leave full of love, full of appreciation, and full of hope. How many people think he's full of it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now the Clinton Administration is leaving town, and Janet Reno looking for a new job. She said today she's gonna start her own Website, but the Amazon.com already taken, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Carnie Wilson on the cover of People magazine? Look at this -- look how pretty she looks. It's amazing, she lost 150 pounds. Dropped 20 dress sizes. To give an idea how much weight she's lost, today, President Clinton took her name and number out of his Rolodex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Yasser Arafat said that he's hoping to reach a peace deal with Israel before President Clinton leaves office. Isn't that good news? Wants to try to do it before President Clinton leaves office. I thought that was neat. Yeah. Yasser Arafat wants to reach a deal with Clinton because George W. Bush thinks the Palestinian state is somewhere in the Midwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;98-year-old Senator Strom Thurmond has recommended that his son, Strom Thurmond Jr., be appointed the US Attorney for South Carolina. That's his latest recommendation. Yeah, and in his recommendation, Senator Thurmond wrote that his son is very bright, very hard-working, and shows a lot of maturity for an 82-year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, what a crowd. Boy. Good crowd. You know, you sound like the Californians that haven't gotten their electric bill yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I saw George W. Bush on the news saying the economy is still in good shape. Actually, I didn't see him on the news. I heard him on the radio of my new Oldsmobile as I was driving to Montgomery Ward to buy a copy of George magazine.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And George W. Bush has announced that under his economic plan he will create 2 million new entry-level jobs for unskilled workers, and that's just at Linda Chavez' house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, this is going to be good. It looks like we have the first big controversy of the George W. Bush cabinet. It turns out that Labor Secretary nominee Linda Chavez, apparently, has let an illegal immigrant from Guatemala live at her home and do odd jobs around the house. But Chavez says it's okay because she was never actually paid. She never actually paid the woman for any of the work she did. I think that's called 'slavery.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Her new title is 'Secretary of Cheap Labor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Chavez is defending this arrangement. She said today that she helped the woman find a job. That she did. She did help the woman find a job. The bad news, the job -- making clothes for Kathie Lee Gifford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest, Chavez said just a few minutes ago on the news, she didn't know this Guatemalan woman was illegal. She didn't know the woman was here illegally. She just assumed all Guatemalans got in the dryer when the doorbell rang.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President-Barely Elect Bush also very angry -- very angry over some last-minute actions taken by President Clinton during his final days as President. Yeah. Apparently, Clinton has rented a bunch of movies from Blockbuster that Bush is going to get stuck having to return.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On Saturday, President Clinton visited the panda house exhibit at the Washington zoo. Probably saw that on the news. Actually, he was asked by the zoo officials to visit the panda house. Apparently, they're having trouble getting the panda to mate. And they figured if Clinton hung out -&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview in an Italian newspaper, the Pope said that President Clinton was the only world leader he couldn't have a proper conversation with. I think Hillary said the same thing, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Chuck Norris -- he just turned 60, Chuck Norris. He's planning to do what all 60-year-old Texans do, apply for a job in George W. Bush's Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Both houses of Congress have proclaimed George W. Bush the President-elect of the United States. I want to tell you, the longer this thing goes on, it looks more and more like he just could win this thing, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's kind of too bad. I was being considered to be the new secretary of labor, but my nomination has hit a snag. Apparently the press found out about my Filipino pool boy, Chi Chi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So George W. Bush is bringing a lot of new faces into the cabinet. His choice for secretary of Navy is Sir Francis Drake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Otherwise, George W. Bush, right now he's on his ranch in Texas, resting up from his vacation in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's official now. Hillary Clinton is the junior senator from the great state of New York. Hillary Clinton is now our junior senator. When they swore her in, she used the Clinton family bible -- you know, the one with only seven commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And President Clinton.it's like a week and change, and the guy's done. He's out after eight years. So it's going to be hard. You know, we make a lot of fun at President Clinton's expense, but...this transition is going to be tough for this guy because, think about it. It will be like 25 years since this guy has gotten laid in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton Classic Joke was originally told on this program September 29, 1999. . President Clinton had his annual physical earlier today. He's overweight and has a sore throat. Well, hell, he could be his own intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Democrats are investigating whether George W. Bush's choice for secretary of labor, Linda Chavez, paid an illegal Guatemalan to do her house cleaning. Democrats stuck up for her saying the only American who will do politicians' dirty laundry is Ken Starr.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Linda Chavez has withdrawn -- you know this whole story? Well, you know the whole story on her, right? She got in a little bit of trouble. Yeah, yeah. Her plans now, she says, she's going to live with a family in Guatemala until she gets back on her feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So much for bipartisan cooperation. That didn't last long. Man, it's a tough business. Today, Bush said he had no comment on the case. Actually, he said he had a comment, he just didn't want to try and pronounce 'Guatemala.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you all know this story, that Linda Chavez, she's up for this job. Apparently, she had this illegal immigrant living in her house. . But Linda Chavez claims she was just helping out a young woman in need. Even Clinton's going, 'Shut up! Get out of here! Hey, I tried that one!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Chavez says the woman never told her she was an illegal alien. Gee, I wonder why. Maybe because she couldn't speak English, possibly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, they communicated through a very sophisticated system of brooms and mops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today the problem with Chavez.didn't come out when they interviewed her because, he says, they don't ask nominees about acts of compassion. Well, of course, with Republicans, it's usually a complete waste of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I give President-barely elect Bush some credit. He was very, very supportive of Linda Chavez. He told reporters today, he said, 'Hey, this whole illegal immigrant thing is nothing compared to my drunk-driving arrest, and I'm gonna be President, hah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Chavez lives in this -- she's got a big house with a pool. Big house with a pool. On the news tonight, they interviewed her new cabana boy, Elian Gonzalez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, who says minorities have no power in this country? They can stop presidential nominees just by working for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But as I said, in Linda's defense, she says she was only trying to help this woman. That's what it was. And she was trying to help the woman. See, this is what I love about politics. Bush executes 145 people, nobody asks one question. You help a woman from Guatemala, 'Get the hell out of here. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;People are saying the real reason Chavez got in trouble was -- it wasn't really for hiring this illegal alien and having her in the house. The real reason she got in trouble was for giving misleading answers to the FBI. And today, Clinton said, 'That's illegal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Presidential Inaugural Committee announced today it's going to start selling Republican presidential souvenirs, including George W. Bush commemorative shot glasses, car travel mugs, key chains and license plates. Shot glasses -- everything you need to drive drunk, just like the President did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over this past weekend, George W. Bush had Republican officials down at his ranch in Texas for a big meal. They had ribs, chicken, sausage, coleslaw, potato salad, beans, vanilla ice cream and peach cobbler, or as they call it in DC, Dick Cheney's last meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As the Bushes get ready to move into the White House, it looks like George Bush's black cat, his little black, will be making the trip from Texas. Also coming along are his two dogs. But their orange cat, a little tabby cat named Ernie, will not be making the trip. That cat's gotta stay in Texas. See, that's not a good sign, when you can't even get all of your pets confirmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And some sad news. Maybe you heard about this. Socks, you know, the White House cat, and Buddy, the dog, splitting up. . President Clinton is taking Buddy the dog, and his secretary, Betty Currie, is taking Socks the cat. And I guess, you know, she's used to taking females in heat away from Clinton, so this is not unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, they now say that Buddy the dog and Socks the cat never really got along. Even their pets live a lie. It's amazing, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush's pick for the Secretary of Labor, Linda Chavez, has withdrawn her nomination because she was accused of hiring an illegal alien. So she withdrew. That's the latest news. Yeah, however, George W.'s new Labor nominee may have even more trouble getting confirmed. Apparently, it's Kathie Lee Gifford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;China sent a message to George W. Bush saying that his US missile defense proposal will have 'a formidable adverse global impact, and poison the trend towards multipolarity.' That's right. In response, George W. Bush said, 'What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Boy, is my face red. Earlier today I found out that for the last two years I have had an illegal Guatemalan woman living in my house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then, to make things even worse, this morning I hired another illegal alien. I took a cab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, Linda Chavez, she was going to be the Secretary of Labor, and then it turned out she had a platoon of illegal citizens living with her, and she wasn't really paying them. They would do chores for her, and then periodically she would give them money. . So now she's withdrawn, and she decided to withdraw her supposed nomination after- - early this morning-- a pre-dawn raid by Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Bush people are having a lot of problems with this. They're having an awful lot of problems. And these reporters -- you know, nothing gets by a reporter -- they found out that Katherine Harris actually smuggled three illegal Guatemalan aliens in her hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney was on alert. As a matter of fact, he's taking this matter so seriously that tomorrow at 4:00 pm, he has scheduled a heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I don't want to give the wrong impression. I want to have a balanced view of this. It turns out also that President Clinton, while he was in office, at one point nailed a Guatemalan intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton's got, like, ten days left in the White House after a two- term, eight-year administration.and he's getting to be a little melancholy, and he's leaving behind in the White House a lot of memories, or, as we call it, evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This Clinton Classic Joke originally told right here on the 'Late Show,' August 7, 1998. . President Clinton's approval rating is still very high. Here's how it breaks down. 63% of Americans approve of the job Clinton is doing. 64% of the Americans approve of the job Clinton is getting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, yesterday was moving day for George W. Bush. And they executed another guy in Texas. Yeah. In fact, Bush had everything loaded up in the U-Haul and he pulled up to the prison and told his wife, Laura, 'Keep the engine running. I'm just in for a minute. I gotta execute a guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, George Bush moved out of the Texas governor mansion.  Yesterday he flew to Washington, DC, but can't move into the White House yet.  Luckily, Linda Chavez has a spare room. . In fact, if he does the dishes, she'll throw in a couple of bucks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you all heard about that story with Linda 'the nation's innkeeper' Chavez. Forced to step down as the nominee for Secretary of Labor after it was revealed that she had an illegal immigrant living at her house doing odd jobs. In fact, yesterday, she had a big press conference. She was late, like an hour late. Well, sure, she couldn't find any clean clothes to wear now that she's doing her own laundry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you something, to give you an idea how serious this Linda Chavez has become. At some point, Dick Cheney was actually going to tell George W. Bush about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The moral of this story is, if you want to sweep an incident under the rug, don't hire an illegal immigrant to do it for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And George W. Bush's other controversial appointment is this guy, Senator John Ashcroft. They want him to be Attorney General. . Did you read about this guy? He's a fundamentalist. He doesn't believe in drinking. He doesn't believe in smoking. He doesn't believe in partying. The question is, how the hell did he meet George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they're going after this Ashcroft guy. They're saying he's anti-gay. Now they're saying he's anti-women. Yeah, they got him as Attorney General, he should be opening for Eminem, shouldn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It said in the paper today that Bush will attend eight different balls on the night of the inauguration. Eight parties in one night. He said, 'Wow, it is like I'm back at Yale again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;At a moving ceremony today at the FDR Memorial in Washington, President Clinton dedicated a statue of FDR in his wheelchair. Clinton called it a testament to the power of all Americans that even though FDR was in a wheelchair, he was still able to cheat on his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, once President Clinton leaves office, Attorney General Janet Reno out looking for a new job. The speculation, the talk, she may become the new lumberjack on the Brawny paper towel thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Even the President's pets are moving out. Socks the cat going to be living with Clinton's press secretary, Betty Currie. Buddy the dog, gonna move in with Bill and Hillary. The Clintons said today they're still looking for a good home for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;NASA said today it will try to land a spacecraft, a spacecraft on the asteroid Eros next month. This is the first such attempt. Landing on an actual asteroid that's moving. Scientists say chance of success less than 1%. Actually, he said there's a better chance of Bill landing on Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported in the Washington Post that George W. Bush's wife Laura has finally decided what to wear to next weekend's inaugural ball. It's true, and they showed a picture and everything. Yeah, apparently, it's a big white gown that says, 'I'm with stupid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The US Army unveiled a new slogan yesterday, replacing 'Be All That You Can Be' with their new phrase, 'An Army of One.' That's the new one. That's the actual new slogan, yeah. Apparently, this narrowly beat out the runner-up slogan, 'Keep it to Yourself if You're Queer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, you're here on a magic night. The entire balcony is filled with undocumented nannies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I just want to say one thing, Pepi was not my gardener. Do you understand? Pepi was just a house guest and occasionally he would do yard work for spare change, but he was not...he didn't work for me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Linda Chavez, ladies and gentlemen, will not be our secretary of labor, no. She has withdrawn the nomination. . Here's the reason -- she said that suddenly she found herself bogged down with an incredible amount of housework.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George Bush and his buddies are putting together the inaugural coming up in, oh gosh, I guess a couple of weeks. And you know who's going to be the headliner at the Bush inauguration? Ricky Martin. What a coincidence, he was a houseguest of Linda Chavez for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's going to be an all-Latin bill for the inauguration. You're going to have Ricky Martin. You're going to have Gloria Estefan. You're going to have Elian Gonzalez. What a night, what a night!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight's Clinton Classic originally told February 9, 1998. . Here's tonight's Clinton Classic Joke. Yesterday in Brentwood, California, Monica Lewinsky had a car accident. Now, when word got back to President Clinton that she had been rear-ended, he issued a denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;'West Wing' beat 'Temptation Island,' which.just goes to show if you want trashy sex, it's hard to top the Oval office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush made another Cabinet appointment today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named Elaine Chao to his Cabinet. She would be the first Asian Secretary of Labor. Very impressive. It turns out she also has an illegal alien problem. . Well, she just helped them with their math. But other than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That Guatemalan woman, you know, the one who lives in former Labor Secretary nominee Linda Chavez's house. Today, she defended her, defended Linda Chavez on television. She said whenever they traveled, Linda would always remember to poke holes in the trunk of the car so she could breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't think Bush gets it. Today Bush called the Guatemalan woman and said, 'Hey, how much do you charge to do the White House?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday in Washington, the FDR Memorial was unveiled that shows FDR in his wheelchair, something very few people saw when he was alive. Back then, the press had an unwritten rule they would only photograph FDR from the waist up -- a practice they brought back under President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you know President Clinton has embarked on a series of farewell tours around the country. He's not calling it a farewell tour. He's calling it 'Last Chance to Sleep with the President Tour,' pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, this is it, girls. After this, he's just another old guy at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they said in the Times today that Clinton is looking for office space in midtown Manhattan. So his wife will be in the Senate in DC. And he'll have an office in Manhattan. Talk about 'Temptation Island.' There is 'Temptation Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day everybody. Or as they call it at Bob Jones University -- Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President-elect George W. Bush spoke about what a great man Martin Luther King was and how much he accomplished. And then his Attorney General nominee, John Ashcroft, gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Problems continue for Ashcroft. Democrats are accusing him of being pro-gun, anti-women, anti-gay, anti-minority and anti-affirmative action. So at least he's a moderate Republican. Thank God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ashcroft tried to answer charges that he is insensitive to minorities by having an African American hold a press conference and speak for him. Did you see that today? He had an African American guy come up and speak for him. And what better way to prove you're not insensitive to minorities than making the black guy work on Martin Luther King's birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, this Ashcroft guy, a very religious man. Very religious man, Ashcroft. He considers Sunday -- as I said, he considers Sunday to be a day of rest -- so do the Minnesota Vikings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And as part of his final official acts -- or one of his last official acts, rather -- President Clinton has pardoned 62 criminals from jail. Which is good news. I guess, the new XFL league will finally have enough players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's hard to believe there's just one week left in the Clinton presidency. You know, I just hope he doesn't do anything in these final days that will mar his record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Whether you like the guy or not, they won't leave him alone. See what the Republicans got going now? Clinton's disbarment -- they're trying to get him kicked out -- trying to take away his law practice, so he's unable to practice law. His disbarment case is scheduled for January 22nd, two days after he leaves office. Isn't that amazing? I mean, one day you're the leader of the free world, and two days later you're an out-of-work saxophone player hauled in on a morals charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More and more facts coming out about the big Bush inaugural ball this weekend. Performing that night, you know who's performing that night? That country group, Asleep at the Wheel -- which I believe will also be the new Bush presidential slogan, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After that will be a tribute to Dick Cheney by Jack Mack and the Heart Attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said on the news today that security for this weekend will be the tightest of any presidential inauguration in history. And I'm thinking, what are they worried about? Why would anyone attempt something on George W. Bush's life? I mean, either way, Dick Cheney's going to be president, right?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, now, I understand Bush is trying to win over the African American voters. In fact, today he started using his rap name, 'Notorious DUI. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Senate confirmation hearings for Attorney General nominee John Ashcroft began today. . He's a pretty straight guy, this Ashcroft. Doesn't drink, doesn't gamble, doesn't swear, doesn't even dance. See, that's why he was the senator for only one term. He didn't fit in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess tomorrow they'll ask Ashcroft to explain his honorary degree from Bob Jones University. Forget that. How about Bush explaining how he got degrees from Harvard and Yale. That's what I want to know. How the hell did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Ashcroft has been.against gun control, he's been against affirmative action, been against the civil rights law, been against the voting rights laws, but he says as Attorney General he will enforce those laws. If you feel that way, why do you want that job? You know what I'm saying? That's like Bill Clinton volunteering to enforce the anti-sodomy laws. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it looks like there's trouble with another Bush nominee. This Interior Secretary Gale Norton, it seems she has attacked the Americans with Disabilities Act by saying that wheelchair ramps are ugly additions to government buildings. So much for that compassionate conservative thing, huh? What did that last, about an hour and a half?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big story out of the White House is that the small lesion removed from Bill Clinton's back they said was a minor form of skin cancer. That actually turned out to be just a hickey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, they say the President will be fine, but Clinton has asked about having a 24-hour nurse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton received two honors this week. Yesterday, he was given a key to the city of Washington by the mayor. And he was also named customer of the month at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On Friday night on 20/20, Linda Tripp talked about her recent plastic surgery. In the paper today, Monica Lewinsky said she is thinking about having plastic surgery also. She said she wants to get her forehead done. Apparently, she's thinking about having a cup holder put in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems the Giants quarterback -- they said Kerry Collins once had a drinking problem, in the paper today. One reporter said that shouldn't prevent him from being an NFL quarterback. And I agree. You know, hey, if a drinking problem doesn't prevent you from being President of the US, it shouldn't stop you from being quarterback.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This past weekend, in Washington, there was a dress rehearsal for the upcoming Presidential inauguration. They had a dress rehearsal. Yeah, and apparently George W. Bush misunderstood, because he showed up wearing a dress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The White House announced yesterday that President Clinton will make a farewell speech to the American people this week. Isn't that exciting? He's gonna give his farewell speech, talk to everybody. That's right. Yeah, this will be Clinton's first farewell speech that wasn't written on a Post-It note and left on a pillow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Can you believe just two days left in the Clinton Presidency? I'll tell you -- time flies when you're having sex, doesn't it? Look at your watch, eight years, boom. Time flies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, of course, he's got two exciting careers ahead of him - ex- President and, of course, ex-husband.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's really depressing? Clinton's disbarment trial was scheduled for January 22nd. He's not out of office for two days and they're putting him on trial. They want to take away his law license. You know, let him keep the law license. Let's take away his marriage license. That's the one. That's the one he's abusing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier this week, doctors removed a small skin from President Clinton's back that was cancerous. It's going to be okay. At first, they didn't even realize it was a skin lesion. They just thought it was another ingrown Lee press-on nail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Asleep at the Wheel, they're performing at Bush's inauguration on Saturday. Is that the best band to be associated, Asleep at the Wheel? What, was White Zombie unavailable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know these Cabinet nominee hearing things. Today, Senator Ashcroft and Ted Kennedy, boy, they got into an argument. They really went at it. Ashcroft doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke. He doesn't even fool around. He's against everything Kennedy stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And there's still plenty of tough questions ahead for this Ashcroft guy. I'll tell you, and he is conservative. Whoo! Like today, he said he thinks Bob Jones University is nothing but a party school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they're attacking Ashcroft because he doesn't drink. He doesn't gamble. He doesn't dance. Hey, Clinton doesn't do any of those things, and he still managed to have plenty of fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, it's against John Ashcroft's religion to dance? He's not even allowed to dance in his religion. Is that a big deal? When is the last time you saw Janet Reno dancing, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Persian Gulf War. And to this day, Saddam Hussein claims he defeated President Bush. So Al Gore, you're not alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Janet Reno is buying a truck. She bought a truck. She said today she's going to take this truck, drive through Canada, after she leaves office, and drive all around Alaska. How about Janet Reno backpacking? You know, I bet that's how the legend of Big Foot got started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier today, true story, George W. Bush visited his boyhood home of Midland, Texas. Very inspirational trip. Yeah, George W. said it was an extremely emotional trip going back to the first place he flunked math.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hearings are under way for President-elect Bush's cabinet. Secretary of Interior nominee Gail Norton met with senators this week to convince them that she will work very hard to protect endangered species. That's what she said, which I thought was nice. Apparently, everything was going really well until lunch when Norton ordered the deep-fried panda cutlets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many watched 'Temptation Island' last night? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They had a new guest star, this guy.&quot; (A clip of Jesse Jackson was shown).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah. Old Jesse -- or Jesse 'Action' Jackson, as they're calling him now. Oh, man. Jesse 'Who's Your Daddy' Jackson.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Jesse Jackson has admitted he fathered a child after an affair he had with a staff member. Talk about 'Operation Push.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, the child is 20 months old already, and all this was going on while Jesse Jackson was counseling President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. Huh? Sounds to me like Clinton was counseling him, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: 'He was his spiritual adviser. You can't -- you know, Clinton's 'the Exorcist.' You can't go in with one guy. Jesse was overpowered!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, they said today Jesse is in seclusion with his spiritual adviser, Frank Gifford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said today he spent the entire day trying to find a word that rhymes with 'condom.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they said today reportedly Jackson paid the woman $40, 000 cash to move to LA, where she's living in a $365,000 home, and he's paying her $10,000 a month. So apparently, this woman's found the pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow Coalition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is not good. You know, him and Clinton are looking for a place together, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, remember the old days when 'Run, Jesse, Run' didn't mean, 'Your wife is coming?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, thank God we have this story, or we'd be dead tonight. Just when Clinton's leaving, you think, 'That's it. There's nothing new.' Yes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was on this day, in 1706, Benjamin Franklin was born. . You know, he was able to get electricity holding a key tied to a kite, which is how most Californians are gonna be getting their electricity pretty soon, too. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, hard to believe, just one more day till we close the zipper on the Clinton Presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the Daily News, they said between the book deals and speeches, the Clintons are expected to make over $15 million next year. Isn't that unbelievable? . $15 million? They say it's because of the Clinton sex scandals. Because of the sex scandals, that makes them marketable. People want to know about this stuff. I mean, it's amazing. Last year, he was broke, remember? Clinton was dead-broke. This year, he'll be rich. I mean, this is a real Fellatio Alger story. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it's literally a rags-to-riches kind of deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the new Presidential limousine was delivered this week. And President Clinton has the use of it until Saturday morning. Then he's gotta turn it over to Bush. But Bush told him, he said, 'Hey, you stain it, you bought it, okay, pal? That's it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President-barely elect Bush spent this afternoon getting ready for his inaugura-a-al-al-l, as he calls it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And he said today, in order to try and prevent traffic jams on the inaugural weekend, nonessential government employees are being given the day off. Only essential people have to report in, which is kind of embarrassing. I mean, Bush gets the whole weekend off, and Cheney's got to work. How fair is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This afternoon, General Colin Powell told George W. Bush he went to see the new movie 'Thirteen Days' -- terrific movie -- which is about the Cuban missile crisis and how President Kennedy was able to avoid nuclear destruction. And Bush was furious. He said, 'Oh, thanks for ruining the ending.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Close call last night for Attorney General nominee John Ashcroft.  Apparently, he was watching Temptation Island and turned it off just seconds before his head exploded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Wall Street Journal reporting that the Republican Party is considering coming out with its own credit card -- Republican Party credit card. It's pretty good. The way it works is, you run up a huge bill, then you let the next guy pay it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, hypocrite of the month. This is my favorite one. Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone.this guy is a Democrat. He's one of the loudest voices about congressional term limits. This guy said, when he ran, he would only serve two terms and then get out. Serve two terms, get out. Citizen government. Well, he announced yesterday he's running for a third term. Apparently, two terms is not enough to break all the campaign promises he made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier tonight, President Clinton said goodbye to the American people in a nationally televised speech. . I thought he came off a bit insincere because he ended the speech by saying, 'You guys were really special. I'll call you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that Jesse Jackson recently fathered a child out of wedlock. It's true. Yeah, and after the story was reported, Jesse was quoted as saying, 'What rhymes with uh-oh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, they had the big opening ceremony for this weekend's presidential inauguration. Did you see that? Big stars, big music acts. The whole thing ended about quarter to 6:00 last night. Quarter to 6:00.  Man, those Republicans know how to party, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Closing the show last night, he was the big headliner, Ricky Martin, which -- is that what the Republicans need right now? Another Latino having to work for no pay? It looks bad.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;At the end of the evening, they had a huge fireworks display. In fact, they said it was the largest fireworks display in Washington since Jesse Jackson told his wife about the baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Guess you all heard that story by now. Jesse Johnson, I mean Jackson, Jesse Jackson, has admitted to fathering a 20-month-old child with a woman he worked with. The woman he worked with in the Rainbow Coalition. Maybe he should try some 'Rainbow Contraception,' perhaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It gives a new meaning to affirmative action. You see, she said, 'You want some action?' He said, 'Affirmative.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And here's the worst part about this whole thing. You know, during the impeachment trial, Jesse Jackson was Bill Clinton's spiritual adviser. He was the spiritual adviser. That's where Bill and Monica got that cigar, Jesse was passing them out. 'Hey, here you go, it's a girl! It's a girl.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now they're saying Jesse could lose his job as spokesman for the Rainbow Coalition. But the good news is, today he accepted a new job, chaplain on 'Temptation Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Several members of the Rainbow Coalition came to Jesse's defense today. They said the one thing they cannot do is keep Jesse Jackson on the sidelines. Well, sure, the cheerleaders are there. Gotta move him back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton made a deal today. Did you hear about this? He made a deal so he wouldn't be prosecuted. He said he admitted that he gave false testimony and false statements. The independent counsel Robert Ray said, well, they agreed not to prosecute President Clinton. Not only that, all the sex charges -- remember the sex charges against him? Those have been bargained down now to practicing gynecology without a license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Thank God that whole sex scandal is all over now. It's all over, and that's good. Now Monica can finally take that dress to the dry cleaners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton suffered a strained muscle -- shoulder muscle, from patting himself on the back all night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you watch Clinton's farewell address last night? Did you watch it? It was pretty good. You know what's interesting? I turn on the TV, NBC, 8:00. I see Clinton. I thought, oh, my God he joined the cast of Friends.  Oh, he's the naked guy in apartment 3B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;His farewell speech to the nation was only nine minutes long. That's the shortest he's ever gone. Nine minutes. Boy, his speeches go by fast when he's not explaining sex scandals, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He did sound a little bitter. I mean, at one point he sounded like Nixon -- the part where he said, 'Well, you won't have Bill Clinton to lick around anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today was moving today for President Clinton. In fact, I saw Janet Reno on the news carrying a couch out on her back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton spent all day packing his things. He said when he gets through with the boxes, he's going to give them to Jesse so he can get his stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's something pretty amazing. Physicists say for the first time in history they have been able to stop light. Stop light? In California, Edison's been doing that now for three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Just happened a few hours ago, in order to avoid being prosecuted for perjury after he leaves office -- which I guess they were thinking of doing -- President Clinton, today, acknowledged he didn't always tell the truth under oath. He finally acknowledged it -- yeah. Yeah, Clinton said that the first time he misled anyone under oath was when he said 'I do' at his wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today on the last full day of the Clinton Administration, Linda Tripp was fired. They fired her today. Yeah. True story. Yeah, and afterwards, Tripp was furious and said, 'How can they fire me? I've got three kids and two plastic surgeons to feed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A group of sixth graders from New York have been invited to Washington to attend George W. Bush's inauguration. Isn't that sweet? A bunch of sixth graders are gonna go. Yeah, it's really cool, the sixth graders were invited because they wrote George W.'s speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, folks, we have a new President. And before people start making fun of him, doing jokes, let's give the man a chance. . Okay, that's long enough. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We make fun of George Bush, but I'll tell you something. This morning he was at work bright and early. Okay, he was early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what I love? Protocol required that both Clinton and Gore be there for Bush's swearing in. You know, the handing over of the baton and all of that. Did you see Gore smiling at Bush? He was smiling. The only thing more phony was when Hillary was smiling at Bill, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Saturday night, President Bush and his wife Laura danced at eight different inaugural balls. They danced eight different times, or as Attorney General John Ashcroft calls it, 'Moving around in a lewd and suggestive manner which will ensure eternal damnation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So President Clinton is officially out of the White House. Boy, those eight years just blew by, didn't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Saturday morning was President Clinton's last day in office. And before he left, he spent the whole morning trying to turn over all of the cushions, you know, make sure the stains were down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton also made a deal with that independent counsel, Robert Ray. Ray agreed not to prosecute Clinton. In exchange, Clinton agreed not to hit on his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton announced that starting today, he will be sleeping late every morning and spending his time doing absolutely nothing. Or as Bush calls that, the first 100 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Clinton pardoned a lot of people. Pardoned that Susan McDougal, which was a shock. He also pardoned his singer brother. You know Roger Clinton, the singer? Yeah, they pardoned him. Roger Clinton no longer has a police record. And he was upset, because that was the closer to getting a record that he was ever going to get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He pardoned his brother Roger from a drug charge from years ago. Like 20 years ago he was arrested for selling cocaine. And ironically, he was selling it to George W. Bush. What are the odds?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said because of all the blackouts, we could have a baby boom here in California in the next nine months, yeah. Especially if Jesse Jackson comes to visit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember Jesse said he was retiring Thursday? Thursday, Jesse said he was retiring from public life to spend more time with his family, and yesterday he announced he's ready to return to public life. Well, what was that, 72 hours? Whoo! Well, you can't mope around forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Jesse was in Washington today lobbying the Bush Administration for an increase in the child tax credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Speaking of scandals, 66-year-old San Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown.admits he had a baby -- or is having a baby with a young woman on his staff. So apparently, Jesse is franchising now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This week, President George W. Bush has instituted a new dress policy for the White House. Very strict. No blue jeans allowed in the West Wing. It is very different from the Clinton policy, of course, no pants in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see the uniformed Marines discreetly move from Bill Clinton's side to George Bush's side as he was being sworn in as President? This is true. Those two Marines that stand there. As soon as Bush was officially sworn in, they moved over because the one guy, that's the Marine who carries the suitcase that has the nuclear launch codes, and he went from Clinton over to Bush. And the other Marine with the igloo cooler, he was carrying the donor heart for Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Chief Justice Rehnquist, he gave Bush the oath of office. You know, this is the second time he's given him the presidency. Remember the first time down there in Florida?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Jesse Jackson had plans to attend the inauguration, but didn't go. Jesse didn't go. You know why? Couldn't find a babysitter. Last minute. You know how hard that is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse said this week he's returning to public life. Apparently realized can't meet that many chicks in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see President Bush dancing at those inaugural balls? Boy, you see him dance? Did you ever think you'd miss the rhythm of Al Gore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you watch the footage, at one point, (Bush) tried to twirl one of his daughters around and the top of her dress -- did you see that? -- got caught in his tuxedo and the top of her dress almost fell down. In fact, Clinton started yelling, 'Hey, that's my trick. Hey, I invented that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You can really tell Bill Clinton hates being out of the spotlight, can't you? You know, like, he spent two hours today waving behind the glass window at the Today Show. Two hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, they followed Clinton around because it was like Monday -- although Sunday was the first official day -- Monday was the first work day. So the first day as, like, a real private citizen and the highlight of his trip -- this is what they're showing on the news, MSNBC. Taking the limo to the deli and getting a tongue sandwich. . He got a tongue sandwich. And that was just in the back of the limo. That had nothing to do with the deli.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a study by a University of Minnesota professor, the most intelligent president we ever had -- who do you think it was? No, Thomas Jefferson. . Going by IQ, just going by IQ, Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton could be the smartest by IQ. I got to go with Thomas Jefferson, because figure it took Thomas Jefferson 200 years to get caught fooling around. He's obviously a lot smarter. You see, Clinton got caught, like, that afternoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, before we go any further, I owe an apology to the state of Florida, okay. Sure, they screwed up the election, but at least they didn't run out of electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Fox Network, boy, they're red hot. Negotiating now, you hear this? They're negotiating with Bill Clinton, Frank Gifford and Jesse Jackson in a new show call called 'Temptation Island, Seniors Tour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

Very strict, no blue jeans, and no t-shirts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hates t- shirts, especially those ones that say, 'I'm with stupid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new study by a professor at the University of Minnesota, Bill Clinton is considered one of the most intelligent presidents we've ever had, IQ-wise. And that's even more impressive.when you consider what he was thinking with most of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I knew Clinton couldn't stay out of the limelight. Time magazine's reporting today that Clinton was offered $2 million to be in a Super Bowl commercial. Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, they wanted to team him up with that woman who catches the Doritos in her mouth. Might be a kind of good tie-in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the reason they asked Clinton is because, you know, I think he's the President most identified with football. . Yeah. I mean, think about it. Charged with illegal holding. Always making passes at a wide receiver. And master of the two minute drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: 'I want to clear something up for people. People get this confused. It's Jesse 'The Body' Ventura, and it's Jesse 'The Booty' Jackson. Don't get those -- people get them confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Jesse's very repentant over what happened. He gave a sermon in a church in Chicago this past Sunday. And as always, very eloquent, probably the greatest speaker we have in America. He got up and he said, 'If you are about to let infatuation turn into fornication, then practice procrastination so your wife doesn't give you a laceration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton -- you know President Clinton is still referred to as President. Even though he no longer has the office. You keep the title for life. You're always President. You know, it's kind of like how we still refer to him as being married. I mean, he's not really.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President George W. Bush has introduced a new dress code at the White House. A little more strict as opposed to the Clinton White House, where staff members just needed a new dress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, though, President Bush starting to get some bipartisan support. Moderate Democratic Senator Zell Miller. He's the guy from Georgia. He's one of the new guys, ol' Zell. He's speaking out in favor of Bush's new tax cut. I'm looking at Bush's allies. You got this new guy Zell, you got Strom, you got Orrin, you got Colin and you got Newt. Sounds like characters from 'The Hobbit,' doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is smart. I don't think Bush will ever be impeached. Because unlike Clinton, Reagan or even his father, George Bush -- George W. is immune from scandal. I mean, think about it. If George W. Bush testifies that he had no idea what was going on, wouldn't you believe him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;An intruder who broke through security at Bill Clinton's inauguration -- I mean, the guy got right to where they're being sworn-in. A guy four years ago broke into Clinton's inauguration, got up and shook Clinton's hand -- he was harmless -- was able to do it again this year and shake Bush's hand. Same guy. And Bush said he wasn't worried about the intruder breaking through security. He was more worried that the guy touched Clinton's hand and then touched his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Our long national nightmare is over. Al Gore finally found a job.  Yeah, Al Gore got a job today. Yeah, he's taken a job as professor of journalism at Columbia University. Boy, you thought kids slept in class before. Oh, man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He's going to be what they call a visiting professor, which means he'll work about three weeks a year. So it's the same schedule he had as Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In political news, the were reports on the news last night -- this is a big story -- that when Bush moved into the White House, they found extensive vandalism done to the White House offices. So now, I guess, thanks to Clinton, the White House is like a fixer-upper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said they also found pornographic material on the White House fax machine. But it turns out it was just Clinton sending off some resumes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore has found a new job. He's going to teach journalism at Columbia University, which is ironic, isn't it? I mean, the guy who did all the coke winds up going to the White House, and the guy who didn't do coke winds up going to Columbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you like the commercials? Those were pretty good. They showed that one ad, you see, for 'The Mummy?' See that ad for 'The Mummy?' I thought it was 'The Mummy,' turned out, it was just Bob Dole doing a Pepsi commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This has been a tough week for former President Clinton. It's got to be tough. Last week he was President of the US, this week he's got nobody to do, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Linda Tripp, why won't this woman go away? She is now suing the US government for firing her from her job at the Pentagon.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Investigators in Texas have found what they believe to be the remains of famed atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. They found her remains. Well, thank God for that. Now she can have a proper Christian burial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This atheist woman, she's been missing for years. But her followers, the people that followed her atheistic beliefs, they refused to belief she was dead. They said, 'Just because someone can't be found, doesn't mean they're not with us. Just because you can't see her, or hear her, or touch her, doesn't mean she doesn't exist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, you know, I was analyzing the&quot; Super Bowl &quot; today. . You know, I think the Giants made a big mistake. I think it was having Al Gore give the inspirational pre-game locker room talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You all saw those commercials, right? When did Bob Dole become a member of the Pepsi generation?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who I feel sorry for? Elizabeth Dole. It's bad enough when he's on Viagra. Now he's wired on caffeine, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush announced his new faith-based funding for Americans in need. This is what they call it. It's an interesting thing. The way faith-based funding works is if you're poor and you need help, then you pray the Republicans don't cut the program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton spent the evening at the opera the other night in New York City. Is that a good idea, having Clinton around near the fat lady singing with her mouth open?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All of the New York papers are gossiping, gossiping, gossiping. That's the big thing now. They all say now that Hillary Clinton is a senator, maybe you know that she stopped wearing makeup and nail polish. She stopped having her hair done. She's also wearing less fashionable clothes. Isn't she worried maybe her husband might lose interest? Gee, I hope this doesn't give Bill a wandering eye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Andrew Cuomo, the son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, announced today he's going to run for governor. You know, where do the Democrats get off? They think just because your father had a job, you think you can have the same job? Isn't that unbelievable, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you see that scary add for the movie 'Hannibal?' The Silence of the Lambs sequel. The ad says, 'He's on the loose again.' So, apparently, it's one of those last minute pardons by Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many watching this new Survivor show? Do you liking this thing? I guess the new Survivor contestants include a chef, a personal trainer, a military intelligence officer and two bartenders. Sounds more like George Bush's White House staff, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, President George W. Bush admitted that he was troubled by President Clinton's last minute pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich. That's what he said. Yeah, later, President Bush admitted that he didn't find it as troubling as pronouncing the word 'financier.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush has promised to bring bipartisanship to his Administration. And, you know, it looks like it's working. In a surprise appearance yesterday, he appeared with Senator Ted Kennedy at a Washington elementary school to talk about education. And according to the White House, Bush and Kennedy are going to make a number of appearances together. Bush and Kennedy together, huh? Who is the designated driver in that one, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, the Fed cut interest rates by 0.5 point today. And that means either Alan Greenspan is worried about a recession, or he's shopping for a new car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's an odd story. The Governor of Ohio just signed a law calling for government inspection of edible panties sold in adult bookstores. . Since edible panties are considered food, they have to be inspected. You know something? I think we may finally have found the perfect job for President Clinton, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Republicans are attacking Bill Clinton now because the rent for this new office he got in New York is going to cost the taxpayers $700,000 a year. More than all the other Presidents put together. $700,000. Actually, it's $50,000 for the rent, it's $650,000 for the sexual harassment insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I mean, is this necessary? We've seen what he uses his office for, right? He can accomplish the same thing at the hourly rate at Motel 6, couldn't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the New York Observer -- apparently true -- former Vice President Al Gore has accepted a job at the Columbia School of Journalism. That's true. Yeah, apparently, the journalism school has hired Gore as a podium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How do you think President Bush is doing so far? Well, don't worry, they're still counting votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush is giving everybody nicknames. He's one of those guys. . For example John Ashcroft. The nickname for him according to George Bush: 'Nipsey'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton is here in New York City. . He's got an office.on the 56th floor of this office building right here in midtown Manhattan. He took the entire floor. The great thing is, he can furnish it with stuff he stole from the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He brought his own doorman: Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I like President Clinton because he fits right in. On Monday he went to a college basketball game at Madison Square Garden. And I'm thinking, 'Well, that makes a lot of sense because.President Clinton has always had a lot of cheerleader in him.' Wait a minute. I think it's the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;With a recession looming every nearer, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan prepared to cut interest rates to stimulate the flagging economy. I bet that's the only thing he can stimulate, if you know what I mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;As stocks go up, traders will praise Greenspan as a financial god, until stocks plummet and they go back to calling him a four- eyed, monkey hunchback.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Washington, President Bush attended his first Cabinet meeting yesterday. Actually the first one they told him about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, Bush was in charge. I understand Dick Cheney even let him touch the thermostat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is now trying to raise his popularity among African- Americans. Did you hear about this? . This week he visited a predominantly black elementary school in Washington. He and his wife went to a black church for services on Sunday. But you know, I think he's trying too hard. . You know, like when Christine Todd Whitman -- remember when she was confirmed as head of EPA? Bush yelled at her, 'You go, girl!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier today, the US Senate confirmed John Ashcroft as Attorney General. Let me tell you something. Ashcroft was so happy, he was almost dancing in the aisle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, that is now punishable by death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore -- God bless him -- Al Gore, still at it. Did you see him today on the news? Counting ballots? You see him? He's still looking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday was Al Gore's first day as a professor. He's teaching school now. And, boy, you got to feel sorry for his Secret Service agent, you know? I mean, one day you're taking a bullet for the President, the next day, you're dodging spitballs for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a strange story. Police here in Huntington Beach, California, searching for a naked man who broke into two homes. A guy broke into two homes yesterday morning. Last seen running down the street completely naked. Let me tell you something. It is not easy going from being the President of the US to an ordinary citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a huge controversy over this new office that Clinton has gotten himself in New York City. Apparently it's on the top floor of a 57- story building. He's got the top floor. I guess Clinton wanted the top floor, not because of the Central Park views, obviously. He figured by the time Hillary got up the elevator, you know, he could be fully dressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A consortium of scientists say it will be possible to create a cloned human being in 12 to 24 months. Within two years, we could have a cloned human being. Hah! Today Jesse Jackson said, &quot;That's nothing. I could do it in nine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier tonight, President George W. Bush invited members of the Kennedy family over to watch the movie Thirteen Days, which is all about the Cuban missile crisis. That's true. Yeah, they all got together and watched that movie about the Cuban missile crisis. Yeah, and apparently there was one awkward moment when halfway through the movie, George W. leaned over and said, 'Gee, I wonder how it ends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;One year ago today, one year ago from this day, Al Gore was declared the winner of the New Hampshire primary. That was one year ago today that that happened. And in a related story, earlier today, Al Gore was declared the winner of a game of Nintendo football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that teen horror film director Wes Craven.was actually asked to shoot a film that documented Bill Clinton's last day in office. That's a true story, yeah. Yeah, apparently Craven wanted to call the film, 'I know who you did last summer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton has got an office like a couple of blocks from where we are. . It's a great location. It's right between a Wendy's and a Hooter's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I walked by the building and I went in the lobby and there's a sign in the lobby.that says 'All wives must be announced.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's a brand new building right there on 57th Street. Have you seen it? Hump Tower?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton's office is on the 56th floor of this office building. . What a view! He can see the East River. He can see Central Park. He can see the Hudson River. He can see Hillary coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, John Ashcroft started off his first day of Attorney General by taking a drug test. You have to take a drug test. Everybody does. And unfortunately, he leaned so far to the right, he kept missing the cup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's an odd story. It seems in New Mexico, a petition is being circulated asking that legendary outlaw Billy the Kid be given a full pardon for his life of crime. I didn't even know he gave money to the Clintons, did you?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems a three-ton elephant was smuggled into Mexico right past customs agents. Imagine that, not seeing someone smuggle in an elephant. Today Hillary Clinton said, 'I know how they feel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, of course, the big gossip in Washington is that Senator Hillary Clinton stopped wearing makeup. She stopped wearing makeup. Not wearing nail polish. Not even getting her hair done anymore. Which is unusual, I think, for women, don't you think? I mean, even Janet Reno still puts that black stuff under her eyes before a big game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Republicans now attacking Bill Clinton because of the rent in his new office in New York is going to cost taxpayers $700,000 a year for this little love shack he's got going down there. That's more than all the Presidents put together. You know, I was thinking about that. We had Jimmy Carter here on Monday night. Jimmy Carter, great man. We should get Jimmy to build one those Habitat for Humanity houses for Clinton. 5 grand, 6 grand. You move right in, two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Recent medical research says that rather than traditional advice of bed rest, cancer patients can improve their chances of recovery by walking for an hour, three to four times a week. Doesn't this sound suspiciously like the new Republican health care plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The California prune board was in the news this week. . This is what they did. They finally got approval to call prunes dried plums. Apparently, they thought prunes sounds and looks too much like Bob Dole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Did you &quot;see little Kimmi&quot; on Survivor? &quot;She beat Tina in a speed worm- eating contest. See her eat the worm? . She ate the worm like that. In fact, today she got a congratulations call from President Clinton. President Clinton -- very impressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: The New Mexico Legislature has formally asked their governor, the governor of New Mexico, to pardon the Old West outlaw Billy the Kid. They've asked him to pardon -- that's a true story. Yeah, apparently Billy the Kid's ex-wife was a big contributor to Hillary Clinton's campaign, so - they got him off the hook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Down in Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney saw his shadow. It startled him, and he had a mild heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How do you think George W. Bush is doing as our President? What do you think about George W.? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay, all right. All right, they're still counting ballots, so this thing's not over. By no stretch of the imagination is this a done deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's a gunner, ain't he, that George W.? He had his first National Prayer Breakfast this morning. And it was interesting, he was there, and George W. Bush was actually, well, he was praying for more bacon, that's what he was praying for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. said he doesn't watch television. Of course, well, the reason for that is the Clintons stole the White House satellite dish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, so far, the theme of this Bush guy, he's reaching across the aisle to ask the Democrats for help. You know? He's reaching out to the Democrats. Like Tuesday, for example, he asked Senator Lieberman to help him with his taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Then earlier today, he asked Ted Kennedy if he'd like to join him in happy hour. And I thought, 'Well, at least it's something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;That's what George W. Bush is doing, symbolically reaching across the aisle, you know. ... And I was thinking about this, I think the only time Clinton ever really reached across the aisle&quot; is &quot;one time when he groped a flight attendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On Friday, President Bush spoke at a Washington prayer breakfast.  Everyone prayed that Dick Cheney lives the whole four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton gave his first speech today. $100,000 a speech. Isn't that amazing? It's really ironic. Now he's making money just by opening his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're saying now Hillary Clinton has completely changed her look. She stopped getting her hair done. You see? Did you see the picture in the paper? She's not wearing makeup. She's not wearing nail polish. She's wearing completely different clothes. You know what I think? I think she's pretty smart. I think she's trying to disguise herself after stealing all that stuff from the White House. People are gonna be looking for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you been following the adventures of Ferdinand and Imelda Clinton this week, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the Clintons didn't really want to leave Washington, so they took it with them. You know, whatever they could carry -- it's like the Beverly Hillbillies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, now, the Clintons say they will give it back. Oh, this is all a huge misunderstanding. The Clintons said today they will give back any gift items if it turns out those items weren't meant personally for them. You know, like the antique silver tray that says, 'Good Luck, President Jefferson. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Bush White House has started giving drug tests to all employees. Mandatory to work in the White House, you have to take a drug test.  And the first person to take the test? President Bush passed it with flying colors. How about that? Yeah. Nice to see a President unzipping his pants for good instead of evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And fashion experts say that President Bush is helping bring back cowboy boots and cowboy hats. See? So it's not just for male strippers anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here in Los Angeles, you know what we're doing? We're now getting our electric power from Mexico. We're buying electric power from Mexico. And it's pretty good, too. The only drawback is you have to boil it first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that, earlier today, Ariel Sharon was elected the prime minister of Israel by a landslide. Won by a landslide. That's what they're saying. Yeah, and apparently the Palestinians celebrated by picking up pieces of the landslide and throwing it at the Israelis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President George W. Bush unveiled his education reform plan.  He has a big education plan. Yeah, the President was quoted as saying, 'I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How about that George W. Bush? Now, I don't care whether you voted for the guy, whether you didn't vote for the guy. I don't even care if you're from Florida who you voted for, but you got to feel bad for the guy.  This is the first President in history that's had to go buying furniture from Pier One Imports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They got nothing...all gone. It turns out now that President Clinton and his wife Hillary looted the White House, and they took a bunch of 19th century antiques, including Strom Thurmond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's a list of the historic stuff that the Clintons swiped out of the White House. Woodrow Wilson bug zapper, gone, gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Don't kid yourself, I mean, we're laughing about it, but the Clintons took a lot of stuff when they left Washington. I drove by their house today out in Chappaqua, out in the front yard, the Lincoln Memorial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's crazy. The thing Clinton left in Washington was Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton, former President Clinton is now making his living as an after dinner speaker. You know, he goes around and he has a little speech that he prepares, and he's down in Florida right now. He went down there, and they're paying him like $100,000 for an after dinner speech. And it's for...it has something to do with junk bonds. And, you see, it's a mix up. He thought it was all about junk blondes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's pretty smooth, this Clinton, with these after dinner speeches. He was very successful. Last night he was hilarious, Clinton was hilarious. You know, it was unbelievable. He closed up the evening, he finished his remarks, his little speech, with that hilarious routine he does, you know. You know the one I'm talking about? 'I did not have sex with that woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story tonight, Senator Hillary, the Rod, Clinton defended herself against charges she wrongfully took things from the White House.&quot; Hillary Clinton was shown saying, &quot;They were considered gifts to us. That is what the permanent records of the White House showed.&quot; Kilborn: &quot;Whoa, whoa, easy there, Medusa. You may want to think about the gift of makeup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Clintons say taking the gifts is all part of their plan to change the President's legacy from a philanderer to a kleptomaniac.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lone gunman started firing shots until the Secret Service arrested him. And the really scary part was the minute it happened, the Bushes wanted to barricade themselves behind some furniture but the Clintons had taken it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Firing shots at the White House. Let me tell you. This time Puff Daddy has gone too far.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After the gunman was shot in the kneecap, he was hopping around, and then John Ashcroft came in, had him arrested for dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said that everyone in the White House was startled by the gunfire. Here's my question. How can you tell when George Bush is startled? Doesn't he always look that way?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But the Secret Service said that luckily, Preside Bush was never in any danger. In fact, when Bush heard the gunshots, he said, 'I don't remember setting up a meeting with the NRA today. Did we have a NRA meeting?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;McDonald's today introduced four...what they call sandwich items including a bacon ranch crispy chicken sandwich. Chicken parts, three strips of bacon, ranch dressing and a slice of tomato. You know, forget gunmen outside the White House, the Secret Service better keep this away from Dick Cheney, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, did you see Time magazine this week? They interviewed Cheney's personal cardiologist and personal butcher. The guy's had five heart attacks, you know? Let me tell you something. If you get rid of the butcher, you don't need the cardiologist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But in this interview, Dick Cheney's butcher said that the Vice President's eating much healthier now. Let me tell you something. If you have your own personal butcher, how healthy are you eating, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush held a news conference yesterday to explain how his tax plan will benefit small businesses. And believe you me, he is an expert on small businesses. In fact, every single big business he ran ended up being a small business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This was in the Washington Post today. They're reporting that after Al Gore's concession speech, he had a huge fight with Bill Clinton, actually screaming at each other. Yeah, that's what they said. He blamed Clinton for causing him to lose because of the sex scandal, and Clinton blamed Gore for running a horrible campaign. And for the first time, they're both right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore was so mad, he refused to help Clinton carry the dining room table out to his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And as you know, President Clinton is on a speaking tour all across the US, or as he calls it, 'Temptation Continent.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Monday night in Boca Raton, Florida, Clinton began his speaking tour. He was paid $100,000 to give a speech. Isn't this amazing? $100,000 to speak to an investment firm. Is this the right guy to be speaking about investments? Isn't he broke? Huh? The only investment he ever made was Whitewater. Look what the hell happened to that thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hiring Clinton to speak at an investment firm is kind of like hiring Jesse Jackson to talk to Planned Parenthood, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But apparently, from all accounts, the speech was very well received. It went over very well. Actually, one minor problem with the speech.  I guess Clinton tried to take the podium home with him. He thought it was a gift.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Clinton is also under fire now for renting this office in midtown Manhattan. Do you know about this? I didn't know you could rent those by the hour. Apparently, you can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, you can see why Bush wants to beef up the Defense Department. According to a new government report, the military is running out of bullets. We're running out of ammunition. Oh, good. Let's tell our enemies.  That's a good thing to tell them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's what I love about our country. You can't tell your sexual preference in the Navy, but you can tell our enemies you're running out of ammunition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Britney Spears is joining Bob Dole as a spokesperson for Pepsi. What is that? What kind of ad campaign is that? Britney Spears and Bob Dole, huh? 19-year-old half-naked virgin, 80-year-old guy on Viagra? What the hell is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton are apparently involved in a brand new controversy over a couch they took from the White House that critics say doesn't belong to them. That's the latest. Yeah, took a couch. Yeah, when asked about it, the former President said, 'Hey, I need that couch. Otherwise, I'll have to sleep on the floor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Conservative candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli election. Defeated him. So Barak lost. Yeah, and afterwards, a really depressed Barak was quoted as saying, 'You know, I never should have picked a Jewish running mate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many folks watched the coverage of the Israeli elections? I was up all night waiting for the Gaza Strip to turn blue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak and Barak's lawyers are now demanding a recount in Miami-Dade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Many of the Israeli voters said that they, by mistake, voted for Pat Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today Sharon got a congratulatory phone call from President Bush and Ehud Barak got a phone call from former President Bill Clinton, who said, 'Take the furniture.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;At the inauguration, everybody was saying.that President Clinton looked like he had really put on a lot of weight. . Well, it turned out he had the White House coffee maker under his coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Drama at the White House this afternoon. They had a guy, kind of a sneaky looking guy hanging around outside the White House so the Secret Service guys get on him. And the next thing you know the guy's got a gun and there's some horse play and some pushing and shoving and the gun goes off. The guy shoots himself in the foot. So the Secret Service guys put him in a headlock and drag him off to jail. I'm telling you, it's been a tough week for Jimmy Buffett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former Vice President Al Gore presided over his first day of classes at Columbia University today. . Unfortunately the class was short several students who accidentally signed up for a Pat Buchanan lecture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;If you thought Al Gore was a dynamic and exciting politician, just wait until he gets in front of that blackboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I guess the big story continues to be the shooting in the front of the White House. They said today, on the news, that, at the time of the shooting, President Bush was not in his office. He was exercising, although Dick Cheney -- he was in his office working. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I mean, Cheney has had five heart attacks. Shouldn't he be the one exercising?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush is the President. Shouldn't he be in the office working?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The gunman was a tax accountant from Evansville, Indiana. A tax accountant. And, you know, come tax time, you know this guy -- he's going to deduct the mileage from Indiana, the appreciation on the gun. The cost of the bullets. You know he'll be able to write the whole thing off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Fortunately, the police did not kill him. But they shot him in the knee. Yeah, shot him in the knee. And after -- let me tell you -- after he was shot in the knee, he was hopping mad, that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it seems the only time he's been in trouble was a traffic ticket in '93. That's the only time. Isn't that amazing? So, basically, this is the first time in history the President has the worst criminal record than the guy who was shooting at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the Secret Service says, at no time was President Bush ever in danger. In fact, they said, Bush didn't even hear the gunfire, because he was sitting in his office popping bubble wrap all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see how Fox is covering the story? Fox sent a group of available singles to the gunman's hospital room to try and get him to cheat on his mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They added extra security today outside the White House -- outside. Not because of the shooter, just in case Clinton comes back and tries to steal the patio furniture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, the Clintons being criticized for taking furnishings from the White House, including sofas and tables. They took a whole bunch of stuff. I don't know how much stuff they took. But I understand that their home in Chappaqua, you can still sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess that's two Commandments Clinton seems to have trouble following, now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton spoke to an investment firm, in Florida the other night, got $100,000. People are criticizing. That's a lot of money -- one speech, $100,000. But, you know, hey, he gets twice that much for a pardon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A new medical study says that heart bypass surgery -- if you've had heart bypass surgery, could lead to mental decline, years later. That means Dick Cheney could turn into Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody watch Dawson's Creek last night? Joey lost her virginity.  Boy, that Jesse Jackson gets around, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, the Secret Service caught a former IRS employee outside the White House after he fired three shots from a gun. This is big. This is a big story. That's right. Yeah, the man was immediately arrested and given a job at the Post Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A man carrying a gun was arrested just outside the White House. This is very strange, but everything's under control. Yeah, the Secret Service says the last weirdo who came that close to the White House before being stopped was Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President George W. Bush called Yassir Arafat. He called him up on the phone, yeah. Yeah, things actually got off to an awkward start 'cause Bush picked up the phone and said, 'Hey, aren't you the guy with that thing on your head?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, the show Baywatch announced it's going off the air. After hearing this, President Clinton said, 'This never would have happened if I were still President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In the blind leading the young news, President Bush visited a group of youngsters in Washington DC today in an attempt to promote his new education plan. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems a student from the University of Washington has sold his soul on ebay for $400. . Even Hillary Clinton said, 'Hey, at least I got some furniture and a Senate seat for mine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Clinton, he's kind of a romantic guy. Did you see the Valentine's gift he got for Hillary? Beautiful, beautiful necklace. It's inscribed, 'To Mary Todd from your loving husband Abe.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's talk on Capitol Hill of impeaching Clinton again. How do you do this -- he's not even president. There's some kind of rule where you can impeach a president after he leaves office. The first time he got impeached for staining the furniture, now they get him for stealing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Clintons are embroiled in this situation involving all this furniture they took from the White House. And Senator Hillary Clinton said today, or a spokesman for Hillary said, that Mrs. Clinton is eager to put this matter behind them and get on with the looting of New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The last couple of weeks Clinton has taken a lot of heat over this $700,000 a year midtown office deal he was going to rent at the taxpayers' expense. So, he's not doing that. Now he's moving to Harlem. Clinton is.even going by his rap name, E-Z Lay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Man alive, what a cold weekend. It was so cold this weekend, up in Chappaqua, the Clintons were burning furniture faster than they could steal it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Because of President Clinton's behavior just before he left the Oval Office, where he stole everything in the White House, and he started pardoning criminals, dangerous, awful, mean, nasty, ugly, unpleasant criminals, it looks like now the Republicans are yakking, they're shooting their mouths off like now maybe they can impeach Clinton again. But now this time, it could be serious, because this time, you know, in the Senate they got Hillary's vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;If Clinton gets impeached again, boy, jeez, I just pray to God it doesn't hurt the Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, today is Lincoln's birthday, and as always in his honor, President Clinton went to a theater and took a shot at woman in a balcony. We tell that joke every year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'be careful what you wish for' news, Hillary Rodham Clinton spent Sunday meeting with some of her constituents in a Queens church.  . It was a profitable experience for Senator Clinton as she made off with over $30,000 in pews, cash and jewelry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a related story, Bill Clinton when to confession and he's still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton is opening his office now in Harlem. That's where it's going to be. He finally found a place where he won't have to worry about all those Republicans bothering him. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Is it me or is Clinton in the paper more now than when he was President? Doesn't it seem like it? This whole thing with Clinton, it's like a big messy divorce, isn't it? We're arguing over who gets the furniture, which one's gonna take the cat, how much is the rent on the new place. I mean, Clinton is like our national ex-wife. He keeps calling. He won't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Martin Sheen, who plays the president on 'The West Wing,' said in a recent interview that he thinks President Bush is a moron. . Yeah, and after hearing this, President Bush got really upset and said, 'Hey! That is classified information.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In Thailand -- it's actually in downtown Bangkok -- a building has been named Clinton Plaza. . And get this -- it contains six stories of discos, gogo bars and strip clubs. That's true. Apparently, President Clinton is furious because they stole the idea from his presidential library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And President Clinton, you know, he was featured in a foreign documentary, and that was nominated for an Academy Award. Are you aware of this? I believe it's called 'Crouching Intern, Stolen Sofa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;From the world of 'Who Wants to be a Pardoned Millionaire.' Speculation is running wild that ordinary citizen Bill Clinton's New York office space may be inside this building on 125th street in Harlem. Going for some of that uptown booty, Bubba. All right!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Commenting on Clinton's potential move, local African- American leaders said, 'There goes the neighborhood.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Bill 'Puff, Who's Your Daddy' Clinton -- the man they call the 'first black President'.moving his offices, renting offices up in Harlem. Well, that makes sense. Because I think white people, we owe black people one. Ever since Michael Jackson's moved over to our side, you know, we got to give one back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former President Clinton checked out possible office space in Harlem. And he was checking out this office space in Harlem, and hundreds of people suddenly gathered in the streets to welcome him. Pretty exciting, cool thing to see.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that modern, accurate voting machines will not, I repeat, will not be available in time for the 2004 presidential election. . Yeah, and after hearing this, President Bush said, 'Thank God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Former President Clinton had a big Valentine's Day. He had flowers, chocolates, a romantic candle lit dinner for two, and then afterwards he drove home and picked up Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Democrats saying that Bush's tax plan -- under Bush's tax plan, rather, the rich would get richer, as opposed to the Clinton plan where the rich just get pardoned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, former President Clinton says he's moving his office to 125th street up there in Harlem. He says he wants to do it so he can help the citizens of Harlem. Well, he can do a lot for them, you know, they can't do for themselves. You know, like hail a cab and actually get it to stop.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, there's all this controversy over Clinton's office space. But here's my question -- why does he even need an office? He doesn't have a job. Shouldn't you get a job first and then worry about an office?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I mean, an office with no job, it's like he's Vice President now. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush finishing up the last of his political appointments. In fact, today he asked Roger Clinton to stay on as the embarrassing Presidential relative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, I guess Bush realized, 'Oh, it'd be me if we didn't get Roger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Officials in Florida said today it will take at least ten years - - at least ten years to fix the old voting machines. Huh? You know what that means? Bush could get reelected again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I mean, that's really ironic, isn't it? I mean, fixing machines is actually harder than just fixing the election. What the hell? Just fix the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you, today was a busy day. . I was busier than Jesse Jackson trying to fill out Valentine's Day cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, boy, the National Enquirer and the New York Post reporting today that Jesse Jackson had yet another extramarital affair.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So, they got two women now who found a pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow Coalition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Tomorrow, President Bush makes his first trip outside the country as President when he travels to Mexico. Isn't that exciting?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton is still looking for high-rise office space with a clear view of Manhattan. That's what he says.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy Presidents' Day. . Actually, I guess this was started to honor our first President, of course, George Washington. And to mark the occasion -- I thought this was very nice -- today, at his home, President Clinton used only furniture that had once belonged to George Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, because of the sales, because of all the sales, Clinton said today, 'All pardons, 50% off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Grover Cleveland, President Grover Cleveland.did you know he could write in Latin with one hand while writing in Greek with the other hand? Isn't that amazing? And actually, Clinton could fondle a Greek with one hand while groping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush was down in Mexico on Friday. He didn't mean to be down there, I guess he just got really loaded and woke up there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;While in Mexico, he met with the new President there, Vicente Fox, and when Fox brought up Napster, Bush said he hadn't tried it yet, but he's interested in downloading some ZZ Top songs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Then when Fox mentioned to Bush the bilateral agenda, Bush said, 'Hey, that's the last guy. I'm married, okay, I'm not into that stuff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, President Bush ordered an investigation into whether it is appropriate to have civilians with no experience running a Navy sub. Hey, how about investigations into whether it's appropriate to have a civilian with no experience running the country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, on Friday, President Bush ordered the bombing of Iraq. You know, bombing Iraq has become kind of a tradition in the Bush household.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Bush said today, he looked forward to one day when his children would also be able to bomb Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Baghdad has been bombed so many times in the last ten years, today, Hussein said, 'That's it,' he's moving his office to Harlem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Who do you think got bombed more this weekend -- Saddam Hussein or Roger Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you probably heard the President's brother Roger 'Dude, Where's my Car?' Clinton was arrested over the weekend in Hermosa Beach, California, for drunk driving. I had the same reaction most people did. Roger Clinton has a car? How did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, the cops said he was weaving more than his brother trying to explain that pardon to the fugitive billionaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Roger was caught drunk driving. How about that? I'm glad to see he doesn't have that drug problem anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Didn't his brother just give him a pardon like three weeks ago? Does he think it's a 'get out of jail free' card?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think there's a sibling rivalry apparently, Bill and Roger are determined to see who can disgrace the family name more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, the Rainbow Coalition has a new song - 'Jesse's Girl.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard about this today -- the US launched air strikes against Iraq. That's the big story. And while the attack was going on, President Bush was in Mexico. He's in Mexico. Bush leaves Cheney in power alone for one day, one day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, they're saying the bombing was accidental. Apparently, the Navy was letting civilians fly the fighter planes at the time, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like more problems for former President Clinton. The government lawyer in charge of pardons at the Justice Department said yesterday that the regular procedure was not followed in the pardon of Marc Rich. Today, Clinton said, 'What are you talking about? The guy gave me money, I gave him a pardon. That is the regular procedure.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems the population of Russia is dying off, and they need a dramatic increase in their birth rate immediately. Now, here's a diplomatic mission that is perfect for Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush said his meeting with the President of Mexico shows other countries that -- this is a quote - 'If you are our friend, we'll be your friend.' That was his quote. Yeah. Yeah, then President Bush set up a play-date with Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senator Hillary Clinton moved into her new house in Washington, DC. She moved in. She's got a new house, yeah. .Yeah, apparently, Hillary decided to meet some of her new neighbors by going over to their house to borrow a cup of furniture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that he is seriously considering proposing a monument to African Americans. That's what Trent Lott said. . Yeah, not only that -- the Republican leader said, someday, he's hoping to meet an African American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;An art museum in New York has sparked a huge controversy with a new exhibit that depicts Jesus as an attractive, naked woman. So everyone's - - yeah, people are outraged. Yeah, and after seeing the exhibit, President Clinton announced he's born again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So, here's what happened to George Bush. And by the way, you know, he's just not as fun as the last guy, is he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He took his first ride on Air Force One. He flew all the way to Mexico. The poor guy, you've got to feel bad for him. He had to stand on Air Force One all the way to Mexico. Long flight. He had to stand -- Clinton stole the seats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But he was down there meeting with Mexican President Vicente Fox. You know, like, two brand-new Presidents from two different countries, and they're nothing alike. I'll tell you, they just absolutely have nothing in common. For example, Vicente Fox happens to speak fluent English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think President's Day is a good time to recall past Presidents. And how I like to do it is&quot; mention &quot;what they said. For example, George Washington was famous for saying: 'I cannot tell a lie.' Very famous for that. Abe Lincoln, for example: 'All men are created equal.' President Clinton: 'Oral sex is not adultery.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today is Presidents' Day. Or, as Al Gore calls it: Monday. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We're up against it with this Saddam Hussein guy. There is going to be trouble and it is not going away. And I'll tell you why it ain't going away. This Saddam Hussein.a couple of weeks ago he was pardoned by Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend, President Clinton's bother Roger was arrested for driving under the influence. And what's interesting about that is he is still not the most embarrassing member of his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;A lot of people have been getting up Clinton's nose about these pardons. . So Clinton.writes an editorial in the op-ed page of the New York Times explaining his position. He is very proud of the piece. He wrote it himself on a computer he stole from the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Bush abroad news, President George W. Bush, first foreign trip today with a welcome from his counterpart in Mexico, Vicente Fox.  Neither of them can speak English. That's so weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush met with the President of Mexico to discuss drugs, trade and, most importantly, getting someone cheap to clean the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Political analysts say the meeting went well but could have gone better if Bush didn't couldn't are constantly interrupt Fox by asking him how did he make that little dog talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard by now, President Clinton's brother, singer Roger Clinton, was arrested over the weekend. Gee, I hope it doesn't hurt his Grammy chances tomorrow night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He was arrested for driving under the influence. Apparently, he was weaving right off the road up onto somebody's lawn. Police wouldn't say what his blood alcohol level was. But they did say it was somewhere between a Kennedy and a Yeltsin.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, being a typical Clinton, today he blamed the whole thing on a vast right-curb conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tonight in the news, they said it looks like he's going to get community service, no jail time. Community service. In fact, he's been ordered not to perform again as a service for his community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the New York Times column this past Sunday, his brother, Bill Clinton -- remember him? I think he was a former President. Well, he defended himself with his Marc Rich pardon, claiming there was no quid pro quo. You know, as opposed to his usual scandals where he claims there's no 'quid pro ho.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know where Clinton is this week? He's in New Orleans. He made a speech there last night. Clinton is in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Is this an accident waiting to happen now? Can you just wait to pick up the paper tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You thought they called it the 'Big Easy' before. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a married guy who had sex in the Oval Office with a teenager in the middle of week. What the hell is he going to do at Mardi Gras?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Iraq is still pretty upset about the bombing mission. You know what's amazing about Iraq -- all the missiles, all the bombs -- they said today Iraq could still have their power restored before California does. Isn't that unbelievable? How does that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why did Hannibal (Lechter) invite Ralph Nader over? He's trying to eat more greens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a speech in Ohio today, President Bush says he wants to spend -- get this -- $5 billion to improve reading skills across the country. That's what he said, $5 billion to improve reading. He's very cool. Yeah, the President made his point by looking into the teleprompter and saying, 'It is very important that we imporve redding.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush was on Bob Costas's HBO talk show tonight talking about baseball. Finally, a subject he knows something about. There you go. Whew, thank God for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Bush is a huge baseball fan. Well, I mean, duh! A sport where millionaires work two hours a day. That's the story of his life right there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm told it's time for our George W. Bush quote of the day.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;To teach a child to read and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;'He or her,' that's right. You see, if kids learn gooder, they'll be smarter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What's the deal with former President Clinton? Boy, this guy just won't go away. You know, he's like a sexually transmitted disease. We can't get rid of him, you know? Every couple of days, he flares up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One thing about Clinton, he is obsessed with his legacy. Now he says he wants to start a Habitat for Humanity, you know, like former President Jimmy Carter. But instead of building low-income houses for the poor, he wants to build low-income strip joints around the country, you know, for those men that can't afford Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;USA Today reports that Robert Philip Hanssen's wife had absolutely no clue her husband was a spy. Which makes Hillary only the second- most naive wife in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former President Carter said that Bill Clinton brought disgrace to the White House with his last-minute pardon of Marc Rich. That's what former President Carter said. Yeah, and after hearing this, President Clinton denied the accusation and said, 'That is not how I brought disgrace to the White House.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This week, Senator Joe Lieberman gave a speech. He told a crowd in Florida that he believes he and Al Gore will run for President again in 2004. That's what he said. Yeah, and after hearing the news, the crowd went wild and accidentally donated money to Pat Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that Al Gore's students -- his students in his Columbia University journalism class -- have been told specifically to address him as Mr. Vice President, Professor Gore or Mr. Gore.  Those are the rules. Yeah, yesterday, the former Vice President told the students he will no longer respond to, 'Hey, loser!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight here in CBS, the 43rd annual Grammy Awards. . Former President Clinton watched the Grammys. He watched on the big screen TV that he stole from the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you heard about this spy deal? . Looking back, it was fairly obvious. He would meet.an operative, and he'd always take them to the Russian Tea Room. And at some point during their dinner, he would invariably say this, 'Please, speak into the blintz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Officials down in Washington say this guy did an awful lot of damage. In fact, the only other person to sneak more stuff out of Washington was Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Happy birthday to Ted Kennedy. He turned 69. Everybody hid in his house and then Teddy crashed through the wall and yelled, 'Surprise!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Commander in Chief George W. Bush made an appearance at a Missouri youth league hockey game last night. Be careful, Mr. President, that ice looks slipperish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush later added it was ironic he was at a hockey game because his new tax bill is a real slam dunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The FBI has arrested one of their own veteran employees who they believe to be a spy for the Russians. That guy is doing a great job. Russia is really making a come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;If convicted, this man could be the biggest thief on the US government since Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Despite the thievery, US officials want to assure all Americans that our nuclear secrets are still safe in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Hugh. Remember big, fat Hugh? He now apparently took a $400,000 bribe to get a presidential pardon. And President Clinton is outraged because he felt that money ought to be his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hugh has had to give the $400,000 bribe back. So, if you think about it, the real winnner here is the crook, because he gets the pardon and his money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'll give President Clinton credit on this one because when he heard about this he was outraged. . He was so crazy, he nearly fell off his stolen sofa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;British Prime Minister Tony Blair is getting set for his first meeting with George W. Bush.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This pardon thing is getting bad, isn't it? Yesterday, Hillary Clinton gave a press conference on this pardon scandal. She said she first heard about her brother being involved in it when she got a call while she was in a movie theater. You know, this is gonna hurt her chances of running for President in 2004. People are not going to vote for someone who used their cell phone in a movie theater.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, they are continuing to investigate President Clinton's half- brother, Roger, and Hillary's 2 1/2 brother, Hugh. You know, the big guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess he lived at the White House for the last month and a half. So it's not like he would bump into Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This whole thing is bad news. It is bad news. You know, I was thinking today, to find a bigger Clinton scandal, boy, you gotta go back to at least Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Hillary said today that she knew nothing about her brother's involvement with these pardons. And you know something? I believe her. Do you believe her? I believe her. Hey, this woman didn't even know who her husband was having sex with, okay? Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, six months ago, she just suddenly found out she lived in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, you ever think you'd see the day when Roger would be thought of as 'the good Clinton?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, he just got loaded and hit a tree. He's the good boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A study by the DEA.says that over half of all the paper money in the US has traces of cocaine on it. Isn't that amazing? Even worse, over 70% of all the money in the US has traces of Clinton on it. That's even worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What does Hannibal Lecter call Hillary Clinton? Frozen dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;When Christina Aguilera was being interviewed, just before the Grammy awards the other day, she said -- this was a quote - 'I am accustomed to all the hecticity of these events.' Yeah, in a related story, it turns out Aguilera is the main speechwriter for President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Senator Hillary Clinton denied any knowledge that her brother accepted bribes. Denied it, yeah. That's right, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe this rain? And those poor people in Malibu. .  Man, they were sandbagging more than Hillary Clinton today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, for those of you who wanted four more years of Clinton, it looks like you're gonna get it, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, Hillary's brother, Hugh Rodham, very upset about this pardon business. . In fact, I understand today he went almost 15 minutes without eating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that footage of Hugh playing golf? . Do you get the feeling the only time this guy has ever yelled 'four' is when he sees the beer vendor?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess this came to a head over the weekend. The Clintons said they told Hugh Rodham he had to give the money back. And Hugh said, 'Okay, you first.' So, we'll see what happens there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you may have heard, Bill's brother, Roger Clinton, gave President Clinton a list of ten names of friends and acquaintances that he wanted pardons for. You know something? If you have ten convict friends who need pardoned, maybe you're running with the wrong crowd. . 'I got ten friends I'm trying to spring from the joint. Maybe you can help me out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who first broke the pardon scandal? . The National Enquirer. . And then President Clinton denied it, and nobody believed him. We've now reached the point where the President of the United States has less credibility than The National Enquirer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush, remember him? He's president now. When he gave his press conference last Thursday, he gave it in the White House press room in front of the big blue curtain instead of the open room, like previous presidents have done. . In fact, during the press conference, Dick Cheney sneezed and Bush said, 'Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now it's time for another Bush quote of the day, ladies and gentlemen. . (video of Bush): 'I have said that the sanction regime is like Swiss cheese. That meant that they weren't very effective.' How many people here have had ineffective Swiss cheese?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Remember that trouble we had with the presidential election where we went like two years without a president? Well, some people. they go in there and they get a hold of all the ballots and they count them. .  It turns out that Al Gore actually lost Florida by 140 votes. The Republicans are stunned. They can not believe that they may have actually won this election fair and square.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm no political expert. I'm not pundit. But I want to tell you, based on this news we got today out of Florida, things are really starting to look bad for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;According to a government survey, more Americans over the age of 65 are still working. And that's just in the Bush Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend.George W. Bush had his first state dinner. The invitation was B.Y.O.P. You know what that is? Bring Your Own Plates because the Clintons stole all the China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Clinton is now involved in so many scandals.nobody would notice if he sneaked in a little sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the adventures of Hugh Rodham Clinton? He says that he does not have all of the $400,000 in bribe money.  Have you seen this guy? He spent most of it at the Olive Garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hugh Rodham. This guy is overweight and he's unattractive and he's been mistaken twice for Linda Tripp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There was a celebration this weekend in Kuwait City to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait. Kuwait was (President George) Bush's most famous victory and it was followed by his most famous defeat: getting his ass kicked by a philandering hillbilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;For those of you don't remember, we fought the Gulf War to create lasting peace in the Middle East, dethrone Saddam Hussein and ensure cheap gas prices. Way to go America!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I had a bad nightmare last night. I get this with storms - I get nightmares. I dreamed it was another rainy day, and I saw Hugh Rodham in a wet t-shirt. Frightening.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, this is a scandal that won't go away, and thank heaven for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of Clinton's old buddies, maybe it was James Carville, one of those guys you always see. He was on CNN which is, of course, now the 'Clinton News Network.' And he said he isn't worried about Bill Clinton, because Bill's a 'Comeback Kid.' That's what he said, 'Sooner or later he will make a comeback.' Here's my question. How can you make a comeback when you won't go away go away and then come back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And more problems with Clinton. It seems that Denise Rich -- she's the wife of the fugitive billionaire.visited President Clinton at the White House the night before he gave the pardon. . Nobody knows what went on, but Clinton better pray she doesn't have a blue dress in a plastic bag somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to 'Cosmo' magazine, which is my bible.they say.beer is a great conditioner for your hair. ... In fact, they just came out with this new shampoo today. It's called 'Gee, your hair smells like Roger Clinton. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Michael Nader...he was on Dynasty and everything. He was arrested in New York for trying to sell $20 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer. $20 worth. It's shame he didn't try to sell 800 pounds worth. Clinton could have given him a pardon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know why Hannibal Lecter won't eat any members of the Clinton family? Too slimy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to an investigation led by two Florida newspapers -- they just released the findings today -- if a hand recount in Florida had been completed, if they had finished it, Al Gore still would have lost the election. That's what they're saying. Yeah, and after hearing this, Gore said, 'You know, I feel much better now, knowing that I'm a legitimate loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day on Capitol Hill, Republicans announced plans for a national museum honoring African Americans. ... Yeah, the Republicans say the only thing holding the project up is finding a location that's not in their neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Chelsea Clinton turned 21 yesterday and she celebrated by having a birthday party with all her friends. Isn't that nice? She turned 21. She had a nice little party. I thought so. Yeah, when asked about it, President Clinton said, 'You know, I'm really happy Chelsea turned 21, but I was even happier when her friends turned 21.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Before we begin, listen -- hey, hey, President Clinton, stay away from my women.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Strangest thing (about the Washington earthquake). 6.8 -- that's big. They said one more earthquake like this, and the government won't have to break up Microsoft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;For those of you from Seattle, don't worry. If God was going to destroy any Washington, it would be Washington, DC.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, of course, President Bush immediately notified about the earthquake. Forget Bush, we should notify President Carter. You know, he's the one who knows how to build houses. Send him up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, last night, President Bush gave his first televised address to the nation to help push his tax plan. I thought he did a good job. Think he gave a good speech? Gotta be fair, that was a good speech. I'll tell you something though. It's going to be tough beating that Clinton tax plan. You know the one where you don't pay any taxes at all and then you get a huge pardon at the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Forget $1,600, that one saves $48 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said he wanted to give people their money back. And today Clinton said, 'Give them money back? Why would you want to do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator Hillary Clinton was there last night. And this was the first time she was at a Presidential address as a member of Congress. And, of course, Bill loves it. It was like having a Hillary-cam. He knew where she was the whole time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you're Catholic, today is Ash Wednesday. . Today for Lent, Hillary Clinton gave up any chance of ever being elected President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And regarding the recent scandals, President Clinton said today that the truth will prevail. Boy, he must be getting desperate if he's considering the truth. Oh, man. Has he ever done that before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest thing is that the Secret Service records show that Denise Rich woman -- you know the wife of the guy he pardoned -- Denise Rich and a female friend visited President Clinton in the White House the night before he gave the pardon. That's what the Secret Service said. The night before the pardon. So apparently somebody got secretly serviced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Hillary's brother there -- what's his name? Baby Hugh Rodham -- what's his name? He's trying to cash in on -- he came out with this today. You probably saw this in the video store. This is Hugh Rodham's 'Sweatin' to the Evidence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, President Bush delivered his first speech -- this is important. His first speech before Congress. And this is interesting. The speech was interrupted over 80 times by applause. Isn't that amazing? Over 80 times by applause. Yeah, not only that -- it was interrupted five more times because Bush was distracted by shiny objects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They had a Mardi Gras celebration down there in Philadelphia and people went nuts! . I have not seen so much looting since the Clintons left the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Did you folks see George W. Bush's first TV address last night to the joint session of Congress? Pretty exciting. It was so exciting that at one point, Dick Cheney sat up in his gurney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;During the speech George W. Bush said he would introduce a bill.to make it illegal for CBS President Les Moonves to have lunch with dictators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Clinton was sitting there.with her fellow senators for the address and afterwards she said she didn't see anything that happened, she didn't hear anything that happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Former President Clinton was watching George W. Bush's address -- while having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's interesting. Last night George W. Bush was giving his first televised address to the joint houses of Congress. Meanwhile, up at Columbia University, Al Gore was saying, 'Who wants to come up here and erase the board?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The New York Times was talking about Bush. They said he was poised. They said he was focused. They said he was presidential. It sounds to me like he is drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President George W. Bush made his first address to a joint session of Congress the other night, and laid out his plans for tax cuts and spending priorities. Bush prepared for the speech by having someone write it for him and then having someone else explain it to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, Microsoft introduced their new computer program, 'Shattered Windows 2001.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush, getting high marks for his speech the other night. And we do a lot of jokes about him, certainly. But he gave a good speech. But did you see it when they cut to Hillary sitting there? They showed her clapping. Not too enthusiastic. Kind of looked like she was on her honeymoon with Bill.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it looks like Denise Rich, the ex-wife of the fugitive billionaire -- you know, the one that Clinton pardoned -- she's going to be given immunity. Boy, she is some ex-wife, isn't she? Huh? Does anybody here have an ex-wife who would work that hard to get you a Presidential pardon, huh? Most guys' ex-wives I know would be going: 'Throw the bastard in jail! Let his new young wife get him a pardon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the big bombshell in the National Enquirer. . They claim that Denise Rich and Bill Clinton had an affair. Yeah, I'm shocked, too. Cheating on his interns? That's awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you know about this woman, Denise Rich? You know, she is a Grammy-nominated songwriter. . She worked with Natalie Cole. She also wrote a special song for Bill Clinton called -- remember the song, 'I beg your pardon, let's do it in the Rose Garden?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And poor Hillary, boy. It seems another brother of Hillary's, Tony Rodham -- I didn't know there was another brother. Where'd this one come from? Well, he obtained a pardon for two Tennessee felons who gave money to Hillary's campaign. These are two people who ran carnivals, and they were convicted of fraud. Well, that's the whole purpose of carnivals is fraud, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what they call the carnival business in Arkansas? You know what they call carnivals down there? . The high-tech industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Tony Rodham claims he wasn't paid by the carnival workers for the pardon. He said he wasn't paid, but he did receive $200,000 by shooting a water pistol into the clown's mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now police are saying that rapper Lil' Kim and one of the suspected gunmen in a New York shooting incident were seen fleeing the scene of the incident in a limo. And after being questioned by police, Lil' Kim said she didn't see anything, she didn't hear anything, and she didn't know anything. Lil' Kim -- sounds more like 'Little Hillary,' doesn't it, pretty much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why did Hannibal (Lechter) have Hugh Rodham over for dinner? Wanted to chew the fat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What does Hannibal call Al Gore? A square meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How does Hannibal keep his teeth white? He eats Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What did Hannibal say when he ate Monica Lewinsky? That went down fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a new poll, 47% of New Yorkers said that they would like former President Clinton to run for mayor of New York. Yeah, apparently, it's the same 47% of New Yorkers who were recently pardoned by President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, George W. Bush, he's a very busy guy. He's out barnstorming the US trying to get people all excited about his tax cut package. Meanwhile, Al Gore is trying to get a Snickers bar out of a vending machine in the teacher's lounge at Columbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There is a story in the New York Times today about Bill Clinton. And a few of his friends are saying that Bill Clinton is all alone in his House in Chappaqua. It's just unbelievable. One day you're the President of the US, the next day you're sitting around the house in your robe watching 'Judge Judy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;People describe President Clinton as being adrift, bitter, isolated. It's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;To give you an idea of how the mighty have fallen, President Clinton can't even get a lunch with Les Moonves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: So Clinton &quot;has to kind of reemerge into civilian life. And he's learning how to use an ATM machine. And I thought, great -- you know, good for him. That's a valuable lesson because you don't want to write a check to pay for a hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said that for Hillary, this will be like a second honeymoon.  For Bill, it'll be like his 28th honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, good news for Hillary Clinton day. Turns out, she doesn't have any more brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big story continues to be these Clinton pardons. You know, it seems Hillary's other brother, Tony -- yeah, I guess Hugh represents the sophisticated side family - Tony arranged a pardon for a couple of felons who were in the carnival business. They're in the carnival business. And they claim there's no money exchanged. However, they did promise to introduce President Clinton to the fat lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republican Dan Burton, he was so morally outraged. So morally outraged about this pardon business, he almost forgot to send his love child a birthday card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other night, President Bush's daughter Jenna had the Secret Service bail her boyfriend out of jail after he was arrested for being drunk. True story. That's right. Yeah, President Bush said he shouldn't have involved the Secret Service. A real man would have denied everything and had his daddy fix it for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to USA Today.former President Clinton has had a lot of trouble adjusting to life after the presidency. And, according to the newspaper, he even has problems using the telephone. That's what they said. Yeah, apparently, Clinton is not used to dialing 1-900 numbers by himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: At the 50th annual Miss USA Pageant, Miss Florida's talent, I thought, was remarkably ingenious. She looks through her bikini for Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But there's some changes in the Miss USA competition this year. The winner...the winner gets $50,000 and a sleep-over in Chappaqua.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bad day. The market dropped like 400 points. . In fact, the only people making any big money now are the ones having sex with Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse said he'll amend his taxes to show the money that he paid to his mistress. See, he has just one mistress, so Jesse uses the standard mistress deduction -- as opposed Clinton, who had to itemize.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney had a great day today. He lived!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Dick Cheney had another angioplasty in his heart last week. You know, is that really a big deal for him anymore? I mean, at this point, it's pretty much like getting a haircut, isn't it? . Every couple weeks, he goes in, 'Take a little off the left ventricle, will you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Doctors say that Cheney's heart not in very good shape. They're thinking of replacing it one day with a donor heart. That's why they keep Bush around, for the heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Vice President Cheney and his wife finally moved into the vice presidential mansion last week. The move was delayed a month while they redid the hardwood floors. Apparently they had to sand out all the scratches made by Al Gore's fingernails as they dragged him out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;An Italian researcher says he intends to clone human beings sometime in the near future. You know what that means? That means Hillary Clinton could clone herself 49 times, become a resident in every state of the union and wind up being the only senator in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, now facing kind of a personal dilemma. She can't decide whether to drop the name Clinton from her name or drop the name Rodham. They can't figure out which one is more embarrassing at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems Monica Lewinsky's back in the news again -- teaming up with HBO to do a documentary about her affair with Bill Clinton. Well, it's not really a documentary. It will be more of an oral history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Mayor Giuliani -- last week he gets dressed up with the Radio City Rockettes. . Mayor Giuliani dressed up like that was so unattractive, I understand Clinton was hitting on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Celebrity birthday today, ladies and gentlemen. Today is the 75th birthday of China's Jiang Zemin. The dictator celebrated by having lunch with CBS President Les Moonves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend Dick Cheney had another heart thing. . They don't call them heart attacks. They call them 'episodes.' Over the weekend Dick Cheney had another 'episode.' This guy has had more episodes than The Bette Midler Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today George W. Bush went to Florida. It is the first time he went there since the election. . He thanked all of the Florida voters for being so stupid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Former President Bill Clinton is taking a trip to Europe. He flew commercial. . It's amazing: one minute you're the leader of the free world, the next minute you're in business class watching 'Dude, Where's My Car.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now that Clinton is no longer in office he's got to think up stuff to do . So here's what he's decided he's going to do. Down there in Arkansas, he's going to build a Camp David-style retreat. He's going to furnish it with all the stuff he stole from the real Camp David.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know about this Russian Mir space station? Did you hear about this thing? It is now in a free fall. Remember, they said it was going to burn up in the atmosphere. Now, it is in a free fall. And it's expected to crash to earth -- it's going to crash to earth later this week. Oh, no, I'm thinking of Nasdaq. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, though, if you're smart, if you're clever, if you're one of those wily investors -- is that what they say? There are some good deals out there. In fact, the stock market has dropped so much, the Clinton family now selling pardons, 20 bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Clinton flew to Europe yesterday to give a series of lectures. Hey, wouldn't it be great for revenge if, while the Clintons are out of town, the Bushes snuck into their house in Chappaqua and stole all the furniture back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the short time he's been in office, President Bush has turned into the most traveled President in history. He has spent almost a third of his nights away from the White House. This is a new record. In fact, he's spent more nights away from home than any American President not married to Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Whenever you see Bush, you never se him in the Oval Office. Do you ever notice that? You never see Bush in the Oval Office. He's always playing golf, or he's riding a horse in Texas, or he's playing tennis. You know? I can't tell if he's President or filming a feminine hygiene commercial. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Dick Cheney told reporters today he has a new personal philosophy on life. He says the best part of waking up is waking up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, he's had so many heart attacks, the doctors don't even put stitches in him anymore. They have velcro now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest CNN poll, our buddy Jesse Jackson, whose ratings are at an all-time low.yeah, his approval rating is not good - not good. Not looking good for Jesse. To give you an idea how bad -- last weekend, he had trouble getting a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, now he's got tax problems. With those people -- wow, you think the wife is bad? Wait until the IRS gets after you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Jesse told the Chicago Sun-Times he said he doesn't own a credit card, doesn't even have a checking account -- I guess he's more of a 'just leave it on the dresser' kind of guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky has gained back all the weight she lost last year. I believe that's the cover story on Newsweek. In fact, she told reporters she was even considering having her jaw wired shut, but then nah, she didn't want to give up her sex life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you probably know, Monica Lewinsky has agreed to appear in an HBO documentary on her affair with Bill Clinton. It is going to be called 'The Cow Whisperer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At New York restaurant, Whoopi Goldberg sent a $1,200 bottle of wine over to President Clinton's table. That's a true story. That's right. Yeah, immediately after receiving the expensive gift, President Clinton pardoned Whoopi for 'Hollywood Squares.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, if President Clinton is still looking for cheap office space in New York, he might want to try the Wall Street area -- a lot of openings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton's currently in Europe. Yesterday, in Holland, people paid $10,000 to sit at Clinton's table and have lunch with him. $10,000 to sit at his table. Of course, if you sat under the table, well, it was free, no charge.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky's teaming up with HBO to do a documentary about her affair with President Clinton. It's gonna be a documentary on HBO. But this one's gonna be a little bit different. See, since it's on cable, the story will be told from the cigar's point of view, which I think should be a little more interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a New York Times poll, President George W. Bush has a job approval rating of 60%, which is very high. Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, and you know what, folks? I'll tell ya -- Bush is hoping the number will go even higher, because if it reaches 70%, Dick Cheney promised to take him to the circus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;A newspaper in Florida got a hold of the (presidential) ballots and recounted them. According to their information, Al Gore actually won the election in Florida, according to the recount. Al Gore could not be reached for comment. He was in the teachers' lounge at Columbia University, mimeographing Friday's pop quiz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has had an active first hundred days in the White House. Now there is a dress code in the White House. Even Dick Cheney has to wear a tie with his hospital gown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You remember President Clinton, of course. . What he has been doing now, other than selling pardons.is speaking engagements. Like if you have a church group or a civic group or a school group or something like that, and you want President Clinton to come and speak, it's a quarter of a million dollars. And you know, money well spent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So now (Clinton) has to go to Europe. He has a gig in Holland and for the first time in the guy's life he is flying commercial. . This trip did not go well. About three hours into the flight, during the meal service, his intern kept hitting her head on the tray table.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush, though, he says he's not getting involved in the California power crisis. California voted for Gore. No, he says he is not. He's not getting involved in it. He's being criticized, but apparently Bush is a proponent of something called faith-based energy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, most of the Russians who designed Mir were laid off years ago. The thing's been up there for a long time. In fact, a lot of them came here to America to work -- for Firestone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;XFL football got the lowest ratings in the history of primetime television last week. Did you see those empty seats during the game? You know, I have seen more people at a Roger Clinton concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is interesting to me -- 47% of women say that holding hands counts as infidelity. You think so? See, that's why Clinton never held a women's hand. Their ears maybe, but not their hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During a speech the other day, President Bush made up a brand-new word.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bill Clinton has an office -- $500,000 a year rent. Yeah. Meanwhile, Al Gore's operating out of a Kinko's up on 96th Street, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, President Bush met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the White House. You know, Bush, he's not good with words. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton getting a little bit of controversy, because she has the most expensive hometown office of any US Senator. The office ran over $500,000 a year. She's on a one year lease at the office, as opposed to her marriage which is on a month to month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, today she justified the expense. She said she needs an office with a big front yard so her brothers, Hugh and Tony, have somewhere to work on their cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today President George W. Bush addressed a convention of over 500 cardiologists. That's true. Yeah, and during his speech, the President thanked each one of them for working on Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There's a study, and the study indicates that New York City is now a classier, more prestigious place to live. That's right, they use those words. New York City...classier, more prestigious place. Of course, you know, the study was done before the Clintons moved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

That's what we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica goes down, the market goes up. That's the way it works. Don't ask me to explain it. That's how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, President Bush spoke to a convention of 2,000 cardiologists. No big deal. Dick Cheney does it every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that Bob Dole.is going to be appearing in a Pepsi commercial with Britney Spears. Yeah, apparently Dole says that if this doesn't cure his erectile dysfunction, nothing will.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If fact, the only working lights we have now are from the Mir space thing burning up.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard about this. The Russians were so successful at crashing the Mir space station that today they got a congratulate call from Amtrak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The new President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, was here in Los Angeles yesterday. He gave a speech to an audience of people from Beverly Hills. He told them that we need more open borders with Mexico. Mexico? Did he pick the wrong audience, huh? People in Beverly Hills, they didn't even want to open borders with Santa Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to this week's Time magazine, President Bush, a serious fitness buff. You know he works out 60 to 90 minutes a day with the weights. And he said in Time magazine he likes working out because it clears his mind. Sometimes it works a little too well.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Supreme Court expressed doubt on the future of affirmative action. If we get rid of affirmative action, you know what that means? No more white guys in the NBA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, California officials executed the state's longest resident on death row. Guy's been on death row for something like 28 years. Executed him by lethal injection. Well, duh, we don't have enough electricity. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A judge in Arkansas has thrown out Arkansas's law against sodomy.  I understand all of Arkansas behind him now. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Mayor Giuliani, here's what this guy's doing. It's like he's running for reelection, but.he can't run no more. He's done when he's done. But here's what he's doing. He's going to get rid of all of the lap dancers in the city. Going to get rid of all of the strippers in the city. Going to get rid of all of the hookers in the city. I'm telling you, New York City will be a great place to live but there'll be nobody left here to enjoy it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know what, this week is the 100th day of George Bush as President. He's celebrating 100 days as President of the US. And I want to tell you something. I think seriously, this probably is the final nail in the coffin for the Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;People tell me now that&quot; former President Clinton is &quot; getting tubby, that he's really putting on a lot of weight. Putting on a lot of weight, and as a result, friends are concerned about him. So they bought him one of those treadmills, one of those running machines, you know? Yeah, apparently the one in the White House was welded to the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's interesting. He's put on a lot of weight since leaving office, but he kept trim while he was in office. You know, of course, he was, well, lying his ass off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;California's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore. This electricity thing. The California Utility Board yesterday approved a rate hike -- increase. It will increase the average bill by 45% to 50%. Isn't this unbelievable? I'm definitely taking my Christmas lights down now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to this week's Time magazine, President Bush a serious fitness buff. Apparently, he works out 60 to 90 minutes every day. Works out with weights. They say he adheres to the theory, 'healthy body, healthy mind. ' Tell you what good shape he's in. Today, Bush's doctor said, 'Even though Bush is in his mid-50s, he has the mind of a 10-year- old.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani cracking down on porn in New York City. He's closing all the adult bookstores. Closing all the porn shops. Giuliani says he wants to make New York City a decent place to bring your mistress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky, who was at all the Oscar parties this week, caused a stir. She said today she liked Bjork's bird dress. . In fact, next year she said she's gonna go as a swallow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;If you're on spring break, don't even think about going to Florida because Al Gore has taken all of the hotel rooms down there. They're still counting ballots, so you're never going to get a room. Forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, our President, is on spring break, so the country is being run from the intensive care unit by Dick Cheney at Walter Reed Army Hospital. So...you don't have to worry about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Joe Lieberman, Senator Joe Lieberman announced that he's running for president in 2004. That's amazing, isn't it? Joe Lieberman's going to run for President in 2004, President Clinton is on his way to India, and Al Gore is holding a parent/teacher conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But Lieberman is smart. He says that in order to get the Florida vote, he's going to change his name to Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton, because he's apparently ballooning, he's getting to be enormous -- I haven't seen the guy. Have you seen him around? I haven't seen him. But he's puffed up something crazy since he left office. So people said, well, you know, we're concerned. Well, they sent him one of those running machines, like a treadmill. Actually, actually, they had to send him three because he gets on the treadmill and then one for a Secret Service guy on either side of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But when he was President he kept in pretty good shape. You know, he worked out on a stationary intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's gained so much weight, for the first time in his life he's concerned about getting into his own pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Opening arguments for the national legalization of medicinal marijuana began today at the US Supreme Court. What do those guys have, chronic back pain? Refer madness?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The justices listened to the arguments in silence except for Clarence Thomas, who told a long story.about how with a paper clip you can make a bong out of a milk carton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a recent interview, George W. Bush said he likes to work out because it clears his mind, and he is now the healthiest man in the world. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I got to tell you, I almost didn't make it here tonight. I was stuck in line at 7-Eleven behind Jesse Jackson trying to buy all the copies of the National Enquirer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the National Enquirer, Jesse Jackson's mistress -- what's her name -- Karen Stanford is writing a tell all book about their affair. According to the book, Jesse Jackson gave her a secret payoff of $450,000. Gave her $450,000 as hush money. Well, that worked out well, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually this can cause Jesse problems because his two organizations are nonprofit. See, that's the problem with finding a nonprofit mistress. That's the tough one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This makes Clinton look like nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To prove that Jesse was the father of her baby, she froze one of his condoms for the DNA, she put it in a freezer. Now, that's cold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think she had Jesse right between the Ben &amp; Jerry's, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, we have an advance copy of her book. . Here it is right here. It's called, 'Hey, it's better than having Al Sharpton on top of you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you tried the new drink here in California, the California Blackout? Have you had that? That's the hot drink. Yeah, that's where the bartender keeps serving you till you go black, then he keeps raising your bill 46%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, some sad news. You know who's retiring? Bozo the Clown, retiring after 40 years in the clown business. Bozo is retiring. Well, I guess he figures now with Bush in office, you can't compete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to this week's Time magazine, President Bush -- serious fitness buff. He works out with weights, 60 to 90 minutes every day. He adheres to the theory -- healthy body, healthy mind. A little different from the Clinton theory -- healthy body, dirty mind. Totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's something really creepy and shocking, in congressional testimony today, two groups of scientists revealed they had begun the process to clone human beings in secret laboratories. Isn't that unbelievable? Now, they said they could be fined $100,000 and sent to prison. But here's my question. How do we know when they're sent to jail, they're not the clone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush came out today against human cloning. And what better argument against human cloning than George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Imagine if Bill Clinton got cloned? Imagine a bunch of Bill Clintons all standing around going, 'Who's turn is it to have sex with Hillary today?' 'I'm not doing it.' 'I did it yesterday.' 'I'm not doing it.' 'Na-ah, get Mikey, he'll do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The name Puffy now, since&quot; Puff Daddy is &quot;no longer 'Puff' Daddy, the name Puffy now goes to Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Big day down in Washington. The space shuttle astronauts visited the White House. It was very exciting. Of course, they met Bush and they got to shake hands with Vice President Dick Cheney. Of course they had to reach into the oxygen tent to shake his hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush is very excited to meet the shuttle astronauts. And they told Bush what it looked like from outer space when Florida turned red.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, the longer Bush is in office, and it looks like it's going to be four years now, you learn stuff about him. He goes to the gym every day. He works out every day. Goes to the gym for like an hour, 90 minutes every day. And he said that the reason he works out is because it's his opportunity to clear his head. Well...mission accomplished, George.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What was it 80, 90 degrees today? Boy, it was hot. I was sweating like Jesse Jackson trying to name all his dependents on his tax form.  'Whew, where are they now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To prove that Jesse was the father, she took one of the condoms and froze it. Put it in the freezer to save it. Here's the worst part. He was still in it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, when Jesse's wife said, 'Where have you been?' He said, 'Just chillin'.' So, apparently, he wasn't lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Sounds like a bad rap name, doesn't it? Ice condom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, of course, people capitalize on this, since that whole frozen condom thing broke with Jesse. I saw this in the store today. I couldn't believe it. Have you seen these? Look at this. The new Jesse Jackson popsicles. See the rainbow colors there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the book, Jesse gave his mistress a secret payoff of $450,000. Whew! It only cost Clinton a cigar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay leno: &quot;Where did he get that money? Jesse is so broke, he's going to have to ask his own wife for sex now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush now defending his weakening of his environmental policies. Remember he said he was going to do all this? Well, he's changed it now. He spoke very casually today while eating a dolphin sandwich off his new ivory desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush also came out officially against the cloning. This is one area where he and Clinton actually agree. President Clinton said he also came out against human cloning. Clinton said he believes that humans should be created the old-fashioned way -- in cheap motels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This Sunday, President Clinton will be here in Los Angeles. He's coming here this weekend to receive an award from one of his favorite charities. I believe it's 'Parents Without Enough Partners.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He's getting an award. It's something called the Family Celebration 2001. If I was Clinton, I would be a little suspicious about getting a family award on April 1st, huh? Do you think they're going to go, 'April Fool's!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And for the first time ever, according to the census, white people no longer the majority in California, except on primetime TV. That's the only place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Britney Spears -- you see that new Pepsi commercial? Britney Spears doing Pepsi. Christina Aguilera now doing an ad for Coke. Bill Clinton signed today doing one for Squirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;April 1, Sunday, is April Fools' Day. And here's what I'm going to do...I'm going to call Al Gore and tell him he won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;In the beginning everybody loved&quot; Sen. Hillary Clinton, &quot; and now, her approval ratings are starting to fall. They're just...they're just plummeting, you know. And she's so desperate, I understand she actually told Bill it was okay to start dating again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, the big story, you know, that American spy plane in China -- very serious story. Good news -- the plane is on the ground, all our people are fine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heard that today, all the crew is fine. So that's good news. But Bush is getting tough with China. . He said today, 'We get our spy plane back, or you never see the pandas again. We have Ling-Ling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, apparently, now the Chinese are mad, because they say we were spying on them. But our military says, 'No, we're not spying, we're just trying to find Darryl Strawberry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, you know who's really excited about the opening of the baseball season? President Bush. Huge baseball fan. And finally something in the news he understands. No more of this 'Slobedick Millavogin' guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend President Bush announced he is installing a little league baseball diamond on the grounds of the White House. That's true.  In fact, it is going to be taking place where President Clinton's all- girl Jell-o wrestling pit used to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton was in Los Angeles over the weekend to get an award called 'Family Celebration 2001,' celebrating the family. They gave it to Clinton. Apparently Jesse Jackson was unavailable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And who's started more families than those two, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Slobodan Milosevic has been arrested, ladies and gentlemen. He had to cancel his lunch with CBS President Les Moonves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton, former President Clinton, of course, remembered Daylight Savings Time. Sunday morning at precisely 2:00 AM, he moved an intern's hand forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the situation with China's starting to get a little dicey. On the news tonight, they said this could potentially hurt trade between the US and China. Ooh, trade. You know, we get so much good stuff from China. Gonna miss all of that stuff from China, those little bamboo umbrellas for your drinks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the Pentagon officials said they're worried that the Chinese might get a look at all of the top-secret surveillance gear that was on the plane. Hey, all that electronic stuff is probably made in China in the first place.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, we got word today, our people are all fine. Well, thank God. We joke about this, but nobody's been harmed and everybody's alive and the crew is okay. But they said today that if the crew members are tried and convicted of spying by China, they could be sentenced to working for Nike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I tell you, we're getting tough with the Chinese leaders. Like today, Barbra Streisand wrote them a strongly worded memo -- she will never eat their food again!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;No, I don't think she likes Republicans. Today Barbra told the Chinese, 'Don't give the plane back to Bush. Stand up to that little weasel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton revealed today that the reason she needs such a big office in New York is she has 60 interns working for her, 60 interns. You know what I think she's doing? I think she's just baiting a trap for bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton's on his way to India, and today he stopped at Heathrow airport and bought a $12 cigar. Well, apparently he's dating a better class of woman now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was on this date in 1860, the first Pony Express mail was delivered. . Took three weeks to get the mail across the country, half of it was lost, and every postal worker carried a rifle. So basically, nothing has changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Post Office said today they're considering doing away with Saturday mail delivery. They want to cut it out on Saturday to cut costs. And they said, first they want to do a study to determine how much money will be saved by delivering the mail five days a week instead of six. Okay, I'm no accountant here -- off the top of my head, I'm guessing the savings will be one-sixth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Fortune 500 companies came out. The number one company, the richest company, Exxonmobil with $210 billion -- $210 billion in profits. Is that unbelievable? Just think how well they would have done without that darn energy crisis holding 'em back, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Once again, former Beverly Hills madam Heidi Fleiss spent the weekend in jail. . But the good news is, Heidi says she has found religion. That's the good news. The bad news -- Jesse Jackson's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The New York legislature is considering banning the use of handheld cell phones while driving. . There's a reason, yeah. Studies have shown it's very difficult for New Yorkers to hold a cell phone while giving someone the finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The biggest news is still the midair collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter plane. That's the story everyone's talking about. Yeah, and apparently the planes collided because the Chinese pilot was trying to slip a menu under the American plane's door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;John McCain and Russ Feingold have gotten their campaign reform bill passed by the Senate. Huh? Russ Feingold, isn't he the sports guy on Channel Nine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush got his hands full, because this spy plane thing in China has really soured relations between the US and China. Well, sour, yes, but also sweet at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Barbra Streisand, listen to this, has written a memo to Democratic leaders severely criticizing George W. Bush, but unfortunately nobody got the memo because James Brolin forgot to put toner in the copier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, folks, today it is day four of President Bush not being able to concentrate on the baseball season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This China crisis continues to dominate the news. According to the report -- this is interesting -- before the plane made the emergency landing, the inside was completely trashed. They completely destroyed everything. I guess they had some University of Arizona fans onboard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, China is now saying the plane was not confiscated. No, no, the plane is being detained. Now they're talking like our airlines. 'It's not late. It's delayed. It's an on-time departure, you're just stuck on the tarmac.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now American military experts are afraid of the Chinese for what they call reverse engineering the spy plane. They're going to take it apart and rebuild their own. Did you see our spy plane? It has propellers on it. I would hate to see the Chinese get any of our propeller technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the Chinese said today they're taking a hard stance. In fact, now they say they're going to double the amount of MSG they put in our food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Chinese also demanding an apology for those Jeno's frozen mini egg rolls. They say China has nothing to do with those things. There's nothing Chinese about them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;China said today they're trying to get support from President Bush's enemies. You know, people like Saddam Hussein and Barbra Streisand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, where is Bill Clinton? See, couldn't Clinton have a word with the Chinese? He used to work for them, didn't he? Wasn't he on the payroll? Couldn't he talk to his old boss?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Bill Clinton is in India today. You think he could get any farther away from Hillary? Is that possible?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know why Clinton is in India? Humanitarian effort. He's on a mission to prove that no woman is untouchable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the LA Times, there is a rumor that while he was in town over this past weekend, former President Clinton looking for a house in the LA area. . Clinton might be moving here. . You got to wonder, what is it about this town that makes everyone involved in lying and adultery want to come here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now the Post Office said now they may stop delivering mail on Saturday. You know why they want to stop delivering on Saturday? That's when all the best gun shows are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jodie Foster is pregnant again. She won't say who the father is. In fact, she never revealed who the father of her first baby was. Today, Jesse Jackson said, 'Why can't I meet women like this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, China demanded an apology from the US for the collision between the two countries' airplanes. That's right. Is demanding an apology. And in response, President Bush said, 'Well, why should we? They never apologized for bombing Pearl Harbor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The New York Times has announced that for the first time -- first time -- in its history, it will begin carrying personal ads. The New York Times has never done that. Yeah, and apparently the first personal ad that appeared was placed by a 'single white ex-President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There was a story in a newspaper today saying that had there been a hand count of all the votes in Florida, had there been a hand count of all the votes in Florida, George W. Bush would've won. And I read that and I said to myself, 'Now, things are really starting to look bad for Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney cast the deciding vote in the George W. Bush tax plan thing in the Senate, you know? Cast the deciding vote and then they took him right back to intensive care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So now the Chinese have the spy plane, and George Bush is playing hardball with them. He said not only does he want the spy plane returned, he also wants it dry cleaned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The stock market has gone crazy. Have you been following the stock market? . I want to tell you, the stock market has been hammered more than a Clinton intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The situation in China is getting more complicated, and Bill Clinton says he really feels for President Bush. Well, sure, when Clinton was President the only problem he had with China was Hillary throwing it at him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In retaliation for the Chinese refusal to return our people, President Bush sent back his Kung Pao scallops for being too spicy. He said we beat them in World War II and we can do it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, folks, as you know, this is day five of the China crisis. President Clinton -- President Clinton -- President Bush, excuse me. Thought it was a rerun for a minute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush demanding that China return our plane. Good luck, huh? We can't get Clinton to return the furniture.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The crew is fine. . This is their fifth day in captivity. They say the worst part about the whole ordeal -- dinner. Chinese again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you something, though, China's still better than Northwest Airlines. At least when they hold passengers against their will in China, they'll let you off the plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, see the picture of our plane sitting there with the nose cut off? See that picture? It looked like Michael Jackson lying in the runway. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, China is calling on President Bush for an explanation of the plane's actions. Not to be outdone today, Bush calling on China for an explanation to the ending of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;China still demanding that President Bush apologize. They're going to have a long wait, you know. I mean, if Bush didn't apologize to us for putting arsenic back in the drinking water, he's not going to apologize to the Chinese people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow, President Bush will throw out the first pitch at the new Miller Baseball Park in Milwaukee. Thank God he's not going to let this China thing interfere with the big stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you, Bush has been practicing. His arm's pretty good. In fact, out in the White House Rose Garden, built a pitcher's mound out of soft money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And a final, comprehensive study of the Florida ballots by USA Today and the Miami Herald, hopefully this is the last one. They've counted every ballot, and they say that the vote recount, if they allowed the recount, that Bush would still have won the presidency. He still would have won. Let me tell you something. Between the problems in China, the energy crisis, the stock market crashing, Bush is the one demanding a recount. 'I don't think I won. Let's give it to Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, the Bush Administration announced it was no longer going to test school lunches for salmonella. Can you get more Republican than this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So many people protested. They're going to allow it again and bring the testing back. I guess the Republican theory was, you don't have to test for salmonella, because the arsenic in the drinking water would kill the germs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And former President Clinton now in India. You know Clinton highly respected over there in India. You know he's the only guy that spent more time in the sheets than Gandhi, did you know that, actually?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Just like two days ago -- a Hillary Clinton look-alike tried to get into President Clinton's new office in Harlem. Did you hear about this? A look-alike tried to get into his office. Yeah, which is ridiculous, 'cause if a woman wants to get into his office, the last thing she should do is pretend she's Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;New York politician Andrew Cuomo is in the news, because he's been criticizing HBO's hit show the Sopranos for its negative portrayal of Italian Americans. True story. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, Cuomo said, 'Listen, you freakin' goombahs. Knock it off, or I'll have you whacked.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, Vice President Al Gore -- how many of you remember Vice President Al Gore? Well, he teaches this course in journalism up at Columbia University and he invited me to go up, take the class with him yesterday. So I went up there, and it was kind of fun. The first half hour we took questions from the students. And then the rest of the class, we counted ballots from Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And I have to sit there with Al Gore in the cafeteria for an hour, while he tells me how he would've handled this whole China situation. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know this China thing with the spy plane and all of that stuff, and the tension, the mounting international tension and the diplomacy? I don't trust this George Bush, because he looked at China on the map and saw that it was red; thought it was one of those states that had voted Republican, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Don't kid yourselves. Flying a plane over China is extremely dangerous because of all of that advanced missile technology, you know, that they have stolen from us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Former President Bill Clinton &quot;is in India. . and a couple of days ago they had him riding... put a turban on him, had a turban on the guy. And they had him riding an elephant. Bill Clinton riding an elephant in India, India. It's the biggest thing he's ridden since...well, I guess since.. .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Postmaster General confirmed reports that due to a lack of funds, they're considering ending their Saturday deliveries. Yeah, you guys are working way too hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Because of the financial crisis, Congress says that they have agreed to send money to the Postal Service, and it will be there on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story, love means never having to say you're sorry news. The negotiations continue between the US and China today on the safe return of a crew of the spy plane. Jackie Chan! This thing is getting exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This situation in China seems to have reached a stalemate. The Chinese say they're not going to return our crew until we apologize. The United States says, 'We're not going to apologize.' See, here's the situation where we need to bring back Bill Clinton, huh? Who's better at saying 'I'm sorry' and not really meaning it than Bill Clinton?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse Jackson has offered to go to China to help release the crew. China said no. I guess they figured, 'We've got enough problems with overpopulation now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, some progress being made in the spy plane incident. Today, China said they will allow a couple of guys from State Farm to go out and take a look at the plane. You know, China's gonna be going, 'That dent was there before. No, that dent in the back was there before. We didn't do that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said, for security reasons, he's sworn off all e- mail communications. He will not be using e-mail at the White House at all. Is that a good idea? I mean, it's not like that speaking thing was working out so good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Big Sur, California, Interior Secretary Gale Norton tried to spruce up her anti-environmental image by presiding over the release of five California condors back into the wild. I think observers got a little skeptical when after she released the birds, she yelled 'Pull!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In a statement that has shocked even her own political advisers, Hillary Clinton says she has ruled out ever running for president. Let me tell you something, when a Clinton gives their word, you can take that to the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Not only has Hillary ruled out running for president, her brother, Hugh Rodham, has ruled out running ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton says she is now writing a book so she can understand her own life. She says she's writing with her husband because Bill has a long history of editing her writing. You know, starting with the marriage vows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary says the book will tell the story from her perspective. I think the book is going to be called 'Bill, what the hell are you doing in there?! Open the door! Bill!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Clinton also in negotiations to write a book about his years in the White House with Al Gore. It's going to be called 'The Naked and The Dead.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know this week President Bush released his new budget. I have not seen the whole budget, I'm guessing foreign aid to China way down this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the Pentagon said they had new proof that the collision between our plane and the Chinese fighter plane was not our fault. They're saying it was not our fault. You know what we should do? Let's grab Jackie Chan, Lisa Ling and demand our own apology.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As I'm sure you know -- Jesse Jackson has volunteered to go to China instead of staying home and getting hit with the china. 'Honey! Honey, stop it!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Because he's not one for the cameras, you know. He likes to work behind the scenes, Jesse, as you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;No, Jesse thinks we should apologize. He said an apology can save lives. Yeah, the fact that he's still alive after his wife found out about the mistress and the baby, that proves that an apology can save lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess he's been working this a little while. Jackson said he called the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, three days ago -- not about China, you know, just for drinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, instead of sending Jesse to China, let's keep him here.  Maybe he can teach those two Chinese pandas we got how to mate. I mean, he's good at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse has written a book explaining his whole idea on this Chinese -- did you see the book? Just came out today, this explains the whole situation on China. It's called - 'I got the nookie. Now I want the fortune cookie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.had a baby girl. . He and his fundraising coordinator had a baby girl. I guess he paid her $380,000. Now, Jesse paid his girlfriend, what, $450,000? Willie paid his girlfriend $380,000. Apparently these are the high-paying jobs for women created during the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Our power company -- what is it, PG&amp;E -- before they declared bankruptcy, they awarded over $50 million in bonuses to all of their executives. . Isn't that unbelievable? 50 million bucks -- and for a job well done, sure. You know what PG&amp;E stands for? 'Preserving greed and enjoying it, ' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, President Clinton's over in India now. He dedicated a new school and named it after his wife. It's the Hillary Rodham Clinton School. Quite a place. In fact, it's the only school in the world that when you cheat, they look the other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;While he was in India, President Clinton said he got to achieve one of his lifelong dreams. You probably saw it on the news. Riding an elephant. Clinton got to ride an elephant. You know what that means? Monica was just a stepping stone. He was using her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, for the first time during his Administration, President George W. Bush appointed an openly gay man. True story. True story. Yeah. Yeah, the President was quoted as saying, 'I respect the man for not hiding his gayocity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Kevin Costner was in Cuba to attend a special screening of the movie '13 Days.' That's right. Yeah, and afterwards a spokesperson for Cuba said, you know, economic sanctions are one thing, but sending Costner, that's just cruel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Clinton, they're really getting under her skin about this. And she says she is not running for president. She said she is never running for president. She said she is never, ever, ever running for president. You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen? You know what that means? That means she's running for President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: President George W. Bush has &quot;gone nuts. He wants the Chinese to apologize for everything. And today he says he wants the Chinese to apologize for fortune cookies where the fortune cookie really isn't that specific, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Colin Powell told George W. Bush, he said, 'What we have here, 'W,' is a Mexican standoff,' and Bush flew to Acapulco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush wants China to return the spy plane. Good luck, you know, the White House can't even get Clinton to return the sofa that he stole, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The big news, the stalemate with China is in it's 10th day and there are reports of a secret deal being worked out where China will return our 24 hostages in exchange for Hefner's seven girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is a happy day. Our men and women are coming home. That's good, all -- that's very good. The stalemate with China is over. We do a lot of Bush jokes. You got to give him credit. Nobody got hurt, everybody's coming home. I guess you know, the crew is being released, but the plane, we still don't know about. In fact, tonight they said on the news, the plane is in such bad shape, they may have to sell it to Southwest Airlines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess they were picked up a couple of hours ago on their way to Guam. The crew is flying home on Continental. Haven't they suffered enough, these people?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, when the crew heard they were being flown back by Continental, they asked China for asylum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Jesse Jackson had called on the US to apologize to the Chinese. And Jesse said, an apology is not a sign of weakness. And as President Clinton has taught us, an apology isn't even a sign you're sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, as you know, Jesse had unselfishly volunteered to go to China to help gain the release of the US soldiers. You know why Jesse wanted to go there? He wanted to prove that ministers can do more than lay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Jesse was turned down by the government. He was going to go by himself with no security. He was going to go alone. Once again, Jesse going in without protection. When is he going to learn?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, if Jesse had gone to China, not only would we have gotten the plane back, we would have are had a crying baby on it, too, next to you all the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As a gesture of support, towns all across America - all across America were tying yellow ribbons to trees. The bad news is the ribbons were made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And a big celebration planned here in California for when the crew returns. In fact, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said, in tribute to the men and women coming back, they're going to dim all the lights until June.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How is this for irony? According to the latest study, California is the most energy efficient state in the union. Well, it's hard to use energy when you don't have any, hello? We're like Amish now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Folks, yesterday was election day here in Los Angeles where 'one man, one vote' is also the entire turnout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, President Bush's missing cat Ernie has been found and returned safely. That's also good news. He was brought home after President Bush sent a letter saying he was very sorry, but didn't apologize to the cat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Doctors here at the University of California -- well, in San Diego -- have performed what they call a gene manipulation transplant into a woman to help restore her memory. They think this could suddenly jar her into remembering things again. You know, kind of like that $8 million advance did for Hillary. 'Oh, I do remember a chubby girl, Monica- something. There was a desk, I'm not sure what happened.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier tonight over on CBS, they aired the movie 'Jesus' -- the miniseries 'Jesus,' about, of course, a man who cared for and tried to heal and feed the multitudes. Then right afterwards the Republicans gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I've got terrific news. You probably all know this by now. Big, big story. Today President Bush announced that all 24 members of the American spy plane crew were finally released from China. Isn't this nice? Very good news. That's right, yeah. George W. says his next goal is to get the castaways off 'Gilligan's Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senator Hillary Clinton said that she's planning to take a spring break in the Dominican Republic with former President Clinton. That's what she said. Yeah, and when asked why she chose the Dominican Republic, Hillary said, 'My husband's banned from spring break in the US.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight on Fox, this is great, the seventh annual Blockbuster video awards. . You see, this is what happens when Clinton isn't having sex with interns. We have to do jokes about the Blockbuster awards. This is what happens now that the election is over, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Oh, this is good news. China has finally released the spy plane crew, and already... Yeah. . There's going to be a big parade when they get back to New York City. They're already planning a big parade right downtown. They're going to come right up through the 'Canyon of Spies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But George W. Bush, I'm telling you, this guy has no luck when it comes to China. Last night, for example, he's out having dinner at a Chinese restaurant, and they bring him the fortune cookie. He opens it up. Guess what? It's another ballot for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The end of the crisis came after President Bush sent a letter to the Chinese that had so many spelling, grammar and punctuation errors they felt sorry for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All our detainees are back on American soil. How about a nice hand for President Bush? Did a terrific job. Did a good job bringing them back. We do joke, but you got to give credit where credit is due. In fact, President Bush personally said he has always had very close ties with China. In fact, today, Bush said he never would have made it out of 7th grade algebra if it weren't for the Chinese kid sitting next to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And national security adviser Condoleezza Rice telephoned President Bush at 5:30 in the morning yesterday to tell him the stalemate was over. See, thank God Bush is President. Imagine trying to find Bill Clinton at 5:30 in the morning.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a US diplomat who met with the crew members, apparently, they were treated pretty good over there. The Chinese gave them enough light to read by. They had plenty of air-conditioning. You know, this could be a solution for California residents. You want electricity, you just surrender and move to China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Sources at ABC say that Bill Clinton often sneaks back to Washington to be with Hillary. I guess he doesn't want his girlfriends finding out he's seeing his wife. They might get a little annoyed at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;69-year-old Congressman Pete Stark -- he's our California guy. 69 years old, he and his 34-year-old wife Deborah, expecting twins in August. We're very happy for them. He's 69, and she's 34. Where did they even meet? What, was she bringing him meals on wheels, and they fell in love?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Chicago Bulls -- boy, have they done terrible since Michael Jordan left. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Unless they win their final four games, they will have their worst record ever. In fact, they would actually do better if they sign Vernon Jordan at this point. At least they could get some jobs where they get fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;To celebrate the return of the US spy plane's crew -- true story -- they were served a 'welcome back' meal today of steak, mashed potatoes and apple pie. Isn't that nice? Nice meal. That's right. And to celebrate President Bush's accomplishment, his parents took him to Burger King and let him wear a crown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;An official in Honduras has warned that women who wear provocative bikinis could be arrested by the police. That's what they're saying in Honduras. That's right. And in a related story, President Clinton plans to become a Honduran policeman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The men and women of the US spy plane in China are back home now. They've been gone a long time -- longer than you think. They said the first thing they want to do when they get back home, they want to go shopping at the Gap and watch The Better Midler Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They landed in Hawaii earlier today and George W. Bush is still pensive. He says.he's not going to rest until they're on American soil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;These international negotiations, this diplomacy is very tricky. The way they were able to get the release of these crewmen, George W. Bush had to make a speech using the Chinese word.that means 'very sorry.' . Unless there is an asterisk next to it. Then, it means 'very spicy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Industry experts fear that the price of gas will continue to shoot up in the summer months, reaching $3 per gallon in some places. .  Gas company officials say they are being forced to raise prices because of the ever-increasing cost of screwing us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The 24 sort-of captured crew members from the downed US spy plane landed safely in Hawaii earlier today signifying the end of their 12- day ordeal. Now that he has successfully negotiated the return of the hostages, George W. Bush can concentrate on his next major objective. (clip of Bush) 'More than anything else, I want to learn to read.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: 'Very strong earthquake in China last night, just outside Beijing. 5.9 earthquake. Today, the Chinese are demanding an apology from God, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think we learned a valuable lesson from this whole China incident. For one thing, from now on, our spy planes are only going to fly over countries whose butts we can easily kick. Like Liechtenstein. Hey, Grenada, you're next, buddy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Congress is pretty upset over the China incident. It is now calling for a reconsideration of its trade status. In addition to detaining our people, Congress said that China has a long history of human rights abuses. And China said, 'Hey, so does Cincinnati. You still do business with them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is the actual ticket, the real ticket for the White House lawn -- you know, the Easter egg roll. Look what it says on the back. I'm just going to read: 'Please note the following items are not allowed on the White House grounds with the kids. Guns, ammunition, mace, electrical stun guns, fireworks or firecrackers.' So apparently, this event is a lot more competitive than we thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, just a reminder for those of you doing your taxes. If you live in Chicago, Illinois, listen to this. The IRS came out with this today. Season tickets to the Bulls are now considered a charitable donation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some more sad news, the 2001 World Pork Expo in Des Moines, Iowa, has been canceled. The world Pork Expo. Wasn't that the name of the Clinton Presidential Library?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Children that attend the White House Easter egg roll are gonna be frisked for weapons by the Secret Service. That's true. They're gonna frisk kids. Yeah, not only that -- they've threatened to arrest any child who tells President Bush there's no Easter Bunny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The crew of the US spy plane has come home. But it's still unclear whether China is gonna return our plane. Yeah, still unclear. Yeah, apparently, the Chinese won't return the plane, because they say they don't deliver outside a ten-block area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, people who claim to be descendants of President Thomas Jefferson met at the White House. They all got together and met there. It's a big deal. And in a related story, next week, people who claim to be descendants of President Clinton are gonna meet at Giants Stadium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Down in Washington earlier today, they had the annual Easter egg hunt. You know, where they put the Easter eggs out on the lawn and the kids come out and run around and look for the Easter eggs. And something actually fairly dramatic happened. One kid looking for Easter eggs found 800 missing Al Gore ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;A lot of famous people are superstitious; President Clinton, former President Clinton. He's very superstitious. On Friday the 13th, he will not have sex under a ladder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

You know, you're in that kind of middle area -- that gray area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, too early for the Bush tax cut, too late for the Clinton pardon. So you're kind of screwed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney released their income tax figures for last year. President Bush made $894,000, Dick Cheney made $36 million, last year. $36 million. Hand to God, $36 million. The Vice President made 40 times more than the President. That doesn't seem right. It's not like Dick Cheney is 40 times smarter than. oh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And more bad news for the Clintons. It seems Roger Clinton is testifying this week about his role in an alleged pardon swindle, which makes history -- the first time anyone has ever asked Roger to sing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Russia, the two major political parties have merged into one, forming one party. Boy, can you imagine that happening in this country? Republicans merging with Democrats, wouldn't that be something? You'd have a politician that not only screw the environment, but hookers, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, that's a lot of money, isn't it? $36 million? Paid over $14 million in taxes. I guess that's where Bush got the idea for that tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More and more details coming out about the China crisis. Now it seems that the Chinese threatened our American crew with a criminal trial, but we did not back down. The Americans then threatened the Chinese with Johnnie Cochran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Daily News reporting today that Al Sharpton and Don King are trying to organize a rap concert in China. Well, that should work out well. Al Sharpton and Don King. Boy, one minute you're mad at the Chinese, and the next minute you're starting to feel sorry for 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton and his wife Hillary are vacationing together in the Dominican Republic, yeah. It said in the paper today, this trip is like a second honeymoon for the Clintons. Second one for Hillary, 58th for Bill, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the White House, President Bush will deliver a commencement speech next month at Notre Dame. That's right. He's gonna give their commencement speech. And apparently -- apparently, George W. will tell the graduates to work hard, be honest and always hire a Vice President who's much smarter than you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that former President Clinton has been hanging out in a bar in Chautauqua, New York. Apparently, he was there like every -- what? Like every night last week, he was hanging out at this bar. Yeah, and apparently, whenever President Clinton goes he asks for the usual, and the waitress gives him a restraining order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I love the idea that he -- two months ago - was leader of the free world. Now, a barfly hanging out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore has gained 40 pounds. And that's with only eating in the restaurants in the blue states. He hasn't even gotten to the red states. Just eating in those blue states.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore back in the news. It was reported today -- true story -- that Al Gore has put on 30 pounds since losing the election.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They show the protesters burning the American flag. You know what's interesting? But I'll tell you something. The good news is the American flags are made in Mexico, they are being burned in Canada, so free trade works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush is in Quebec for the meeting. Bush said, while in Quebec, he may visit Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said he's very impressed with Canada. He said, 'There's so much beautiful, untouched land to environmentally destroy up here, I can't wait to get started.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush is up there with 34 other world leaders, but he's going home early, because today he was voted -- the weakest link. Goodbye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And what's going on with Al Gore? Gained 40 pounds. Gained 40 pounds. His plan now is to attract followers just using his gravitational pull, apparently now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the New York Times today, Federal prosecutors are investigating whether New Jersey Senator Robert Torricelli -- whether he accepted ten Italian suits and a Rolex watch from a political donor.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ted Turner and Jane Fonda have ended their separation and have filed for divorce. Yeah, yeah. Jane immediately left to spend a week with her loved ones -- the North Vietnamese.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush back from the big trade summit up there in Quebec, Canada. As you know, Quebec is a bilingual city, which is tough for President Bush. 'Cause, obliviously, he doesn't speak French or English.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Only in California, this is what I love. You know, in Malibu over the weekend, in celebration of Earth Day, they had a big two-mile nature walk. See this is the only place in the world where people load up the Lincoln Navigator, drive 150 miles, burn 40 gallons of gas to walk two miles to preserve the environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Al Gore a big, big supporter of Earth Day. I think he invented Earth Day, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, it's kind of rough for him this year. 'Cause, you know, Al Gore put on over 40 pounds. . In fact, on earth day, he went to hug a tree, and the tree said, 'You want to ease up a little bit, pal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, it's kind of ironic. He always wanted to distance himself from Bill Clinton. And now that he's out of politics and overweight, he is Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now when they talk about Gore in 2004, they're talking about his weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Next time he visits the Buddhist temple, he could actually be mistaken for Buddha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;By the way, yesterday was Earth Day -- or, as George Bush refers to it, Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George Bush celebrated Earth Day by drilling for natural gas in the Rockies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore...you know, this is sad because...remember Al Gore? He was the Vice President for a while. You remember him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And now he's now he's teaching school at Columbia University, and since the election has put on 40 pounds. 40 pounds! It's gotten so bad, every time he turns around his ass erases the blackboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He got on the scales today and demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They say that Bill Clinton, you know, former President Bill Clinton, he lives up here in Chappaqua, about 20 minutes from New York City, and they say that every night now, they see him sitting alone in a Westchester bar. I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, it's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's funny, isn't it, how things change? One day you're the President of the US, and the next day you're buying a beer for the hooker at the end of the bar, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now, wait a minute. Hold it. Now, wait a minute. No, I'm sorry. He did that when he was President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush met with the young men and women from the NCAA champions of the basketball game and yes, that's where you put the ball in the hoop, George.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a related story, Vice President Dick Cheney thought about basketball, experienced palpitations and was rushed to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush admitted did he not see their game, but he had seen the movie Rudy like 12 times so that should count for something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush, back from the big trade summit up there in Canada. He enjoyed his time in Canada, but he said the water tastes funny without arsenic in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Because of this whole problem with China, President Bush this week has agreed to sell a scaled-back arms package to Taiwan. We're not going to be selling our best stuff, as previously agreed. Just going to sell them stuff, like maybe a spy plane with the nose broken off.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Bush Administration said today they want to hire more Latinos for government positions to try to get Hispanics to vote Republican. Bush said he's even willing to get rid of all of the English-only laws. Well, why not? Even he has trouble with that language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Vice President Al Gore, stunned -- stunned Washington today by declining invitations to the prestigious Christian Science Monitor policy breakfast. He is not going to the breakfast. Have you seen Al Gore lately? I think this is the first meal he's skipped since the election. I think he should cut back there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse Jackson, on a 70-day tour, doing 25 cities, Jesse is. He says one of the problems with this country, poor people who can't make a living wage. So he said, starting today, bumping up the payments he makes to his mistresses by $10,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the latest poll in the Washington Post, 63% of Americans said that, so far, they approve of President Bush. 63%. That's right. Yeah, and guess what? And not surprisingly -- not surprisingly -- the other 37% are English teachers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Monday will be the 100th day of the George Bush Administration, on Monday, huh? 100 days of...well, I don't know if that's necessary. I want to tell you things now are really starting to look very, very dark for the Al Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Former President Clinton has &quot;nothing to do, so we're hearing stories now that he goes every night to this bar, and they have, like, a neighborhood bar. And it's just starting to get a little strange. Last night he went in because it's so warm, and he said...he asked the bartender, he said, 'I would like something cold.' And the bartender said, 'Well, then go home to Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, this Sunday, President Bush will be celebrating his 100th day in office. And when asked about it, Bush said, 'Gosh, 100 days. Has it been a year already?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush announced today, he'll approve the sale of four destroyers and as many as eight submarines to Taiwan. You know, Bush is trying to walk a fine line between helping Taiwan and not angering China. And Bush admitted today he's not use to dealing with two different Chinas. In fact -- Bush's staff admitted today he still doesn't get the two Dakota thing. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More facts coming out about the Chinese pilot. You know the one who knocked our spy plane out of the sky. Now the Chinese are claiming he was just imitating a you stunt he saw on the TV show Jackass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore gained 40 pounds since the election. Woo! In fact, listen to this. You know he's so fat now, his ass is worth one electoral vote.  That's what they said today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said&quot; President Clinton &quot;spends his nights sitting in a local bar in Chappaqua, New York. That's what he does, four or five nights a week, he's sitting in this bar. That's got to be a sad sight. Midnight, bartender answers the phone, 'Hello? Yeah, anybody here an ex-President? Some Hillary woman on the phone. . Nobody here like that, yeah. Sorry, lady. Don't know what the hell you're talking about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, at the White House, in the middle of an interview, President Bush got up out of his chair and started swatting at a housefly. Yeah. This really happened, yeah. And when asked about it, the White House spokesperson said, 'Hey, that's nothing. You should see him chase a tennis ball.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hey, you know what Monday is? It's the first 100 days of the George W. Bush Administration. First 100...he's really accomplished a lot of things in those 100 days. Let's run them down now. He nicknamed everyone in Congress. And he had Billy Crystal to the White House for dinner. So that's a lot of things in those 100 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush says they're changing the policy: No longer on air force one flights will they show movies with sex scenes in them.  I would have never thought of that, you know? They made the change because recently on a flight during Tom Cats, Dick Cheney had another heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They're now saying that he's got nothing to do, Bill Clinton, so every night he goes to a bar there in Chappaqua. And Clinton says he really enjoys spending time in the bar because, you know, the more he drinks every woman starts to look like Paula Jones, so he's fine with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;It's business as usual as President Bush is approaching the 100 day mark on his first and only term. Easy chief, pretending to read gives you a headache. Don't forget.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Experts feel that Bush is doing a better job than expected as President, but they admitted they expected him to curl up in a corner and suck his thumb all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The 100 day mark was such an achievement that he a got a congratulatory letter from Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And after these 100 days in office, President Bush said the biggest misconception about him is that he is anti-environment. He says nothing is further from the truth. He says he loves the environment, especially the part where you drill through it to find gas and oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Bush Administration says they want to hire more Latinos for government positions to try to get more Hispanics to vote Republican.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, Senator Hillary Clinton hosted her first party at her new home in Washington. People said it was a lot like the parties she used to host at the White House. In fact, even the furniture was the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And boy, it was hot again today. It was close to 90 degrees today. I was sweating like Al Gore trying to get in a pair of bicycle pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, of course, 'Take Your Daughter to Work' Day. Yeah, yeah. Very nice. Had a lot of fun. Dick Cheney took his daughter to work. They did all of George Bush's daughter's work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's got to be a tricky day for Jesse Jackson. He doesn't know how many kids are going to show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Beverly Hills security company has come out with something called the Superbra. Have you heard of this? It's the world's combination bra and gun holster so women can carry a gun in their bra. Boy, what a lemma this must be for people like Clinton. He's anti-NRA but, of course, pro-breasts. So what do you do here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Finally, he and Charlton Heston can sit down and find some common ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. Most of you are bringing your daughters to work day, huh? This tradition began about 25 years ago back in Washington, DC, by a quick-thinking Ted Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And President Bush let his daughter dismantle 12 environmental regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Two or three times a week President Clinton goes into a bar there in Chappaqua. He's got a stool there with the Presidential seal and everything and...a couple nights ago he pardoned a hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The waitresses have gotten used to saying, 'The former leader of the free world would like to buy you a drink.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Republicans are complaining now that Bush has put too many women in his Administration. That's what they're saying. You know, they're saying that Bush has put in too many women actually in the new Administration. But to be fair, nobody has put women in more positions than Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And this week, President Bush wrapping up his first 100 days in office. Today, a reporter asked him what he thought the next 100 days would bring. And he said, 'I have to be President for another 100 days? It's hard work.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, today, Bush was trying to explain his new economic recovery plan. I think it's called 'war with China.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Controversial Democratic fundraiser Denise Rich told reporters yesterday that, although she had access to President Clinton, they never had sex. That's what she said. True. Yeah, and you know what? The weird thing is right afterwards, Hillary Clinton said the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In other news this week, President George W. Bush... announced that the US will do whatever it takes to defend Taiwan. That's what he said. Yeah, and apparently he added that doing whatever it takes would include learning where the hell Taiwan is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I heard about this earlier today; President George Bush is going to sell sophisticated weapons to Taiwan. Jeez, I hope this doesn't screw up our warm relationship with China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Former Vice President Al Gore, &quot;since the election, he's gained 40 pounds. I'm telling you, this guy is so big, earlier today his ass was mistaken for the quad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And unlike Clinton, Al Gore is just concerned with getting into his own pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top 10 Responses To The Question: How Fat Is Al Gore?: 10.  He's so fat, when he appears in public, the band plays 'Hail to the Beef.' 9.  He's so fat, the Florida election commission is recounting his chins. 8. He's so fat, he'll only take money from the Chinese if it comes with egg rolls. 7. He's so fat, instead of apples, his students place margarine on his desk. 6. He's so fat, the Secret Service has added one agent just to guard his ass. 5. He's so fat, his belt gave a concession speech. 4. He's so fat, he asked Bush if he could be ambassador to KFC. 3. He's so fat, he had one of Dick Cheney's heart attacks. 2. He's so fat, the Liberty Bell is now the second biggest thing with a crack. 1. He's so fat, Clinton is thinking of hitting on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Senator Joseph Lieberman unveiled the Media Accountability Act, which seeks to criminalize the marketing of R-rated movies to minors. In a related story, Tom Green has been deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush announced today that he's going to have a big family get together this weekend. That's become kind of a family tradition. You know, the Bushes, they hate to drink alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, President Bush's daughter Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush, you know...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;She was cited for alcohol possession by a minor. Well, you know how kids are always trying to outdo the old man, huh? Yeah! Drink old pops under the table, yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, the Bush family, not only raising the bar, they're closing it now, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I think this is why the President had twins. See, this way, one is always the designated driver. So you can keep an eye out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Russians only allowed&quot; space tourist Dennis Tito &quot;to go up into space on, I guess there were certain conditions. He promised not to touch anything. This is true. He promised not to sue if he got hurt. And he promised not to get in anybody's way while they were working. The only thing he's allowed to do is listen to music and look out the window. In fact, this same deal, they have with George Bush at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The House of Representatives passed a bill that will give new legal protection to the human fetus. The big issue involves.when life actually begins. This has been going on for a long time, this debate. And they say there is now a new definition. They now say human life begins the moment a woman is introduced to Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;There's a rumor going around Washington that 71-year-old Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is considering retiring. That's right. Yeah, the rumor got started when people noticed O'Connor was wearing her bathrobe over her regular robe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush has nominated one of his college fraternity brothers to be the new ambassador to China. It's true. That's right. Apparently, his mission will be to introduce the Chinese to democracy, free trade and the beer bong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hey, George W. yesterday celebrated his 100th day as President of the US. 100 days in office yesterday. By this time in President Clinton's first term, he had had a couple of Oval Office gropes, but--&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. did something I thought was pretty interesting. He invited Congress to a big luncheon at the White House and only, listen to this, only a third of them showed. That seems kind of rude, doesn't it? But be fair, who really wants to watch Dick Cheney take his soup intravenously?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush, he's turned the White House, of course where the Rose Garden used to be, they're drilling for natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is a nice thing. I mean, it's a publicity stunt but still and all, it's a nice thing. They have T-ball. You know that, for like the little boys and girls who play T-ball? T-ball is just like baseball, except there's no pitching. You know, like the Mets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: After the Yankees won the World Series, &quot;Don Zimmer, bless his heart, he's in the Oval Office and he sits -- he's a little heavy. He's a little chunky. He sits, he sits on Clinton's desk and...honest to God, it collapsed and crushed three interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'here we go again' news, our wacky Commander in Chief, George W. Bush has announced plans to construct a $200 billion outer space missile defense shield. Sure, what else would you spend the money on, George? Education?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: Bush &quot;also proposed turning the whole world into a big cartoon so it would be fun to watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush already demanded that the government hire a crack team of scientists to help make design the project, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;US technicians in China are trying to figure out how to get our spy plane back. They say it might not be able to fly. They may have to take it apart and ship it back here in pieces. Well, that's not unusual. They did the same thing a couple of years ago with Cher, on her European tour.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in political news, President Bush has named his old college fraternity brother as the new ambassador to China. ... No, apparently, the guy's very qualified. He's a lawyer, and he speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese. That's pretty good. In fact, he's even given George Bush a Chinese nickname, 'Dim Son.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush invited all of Congress to lunch at the White House. A lot of them didn't show up. Hillary Clinton refused to attend the luncheon. She said it was nothing personal. She said she's just maintaining a respectful distance from the President. You know, kind of like she did with the last President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, a municipal judge in Texas postponed Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush's court appearance. You know this, President Bush's daughter? ... Gee, I wonder if she knew someone, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you've probably heard about this, last night, Jenna Bush got into an argument with her dad over the beer drinking incident in Texas. Yeah, I mean, he said, 'Less filling.' She said, 'Tastes great.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last week was like celebrity court week in Los Angeles. It was unbelievable. No less than five celebrities had legal hearings this week. You had -- Robert Downey Jr. was in court. Shannen Doherty, Aaron Sorkin from West Wing, Tommy Lee, Roger Clinton. Okay, 4 1/2 celebrities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What else? I guess you know Jesse Jackson is now being sued for child support. In fact, I think it's a class action suit, if I'm not mistaken. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Imagine if Johnnie Cochran defended him. Hmm? You'd have Jesse Jackson and Johnnie Cochran. How much rhyming would there be in that courtroom, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush has announced -- he announced this yesterday -- he wants to construct a $200 billion outer space missile defense shield. He wants to do that. He says he's determined to do it. Yeah, and apparently, George W. says he's certain the missile shield will work because he saw one just like it in 'Spy Kids.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A library in Ireland announced it wants a book returned that was taken out 130 years ago. Yeah, and after hearing this, Strom Thurmond said, 'But I'm not finished with it yet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's how they're comparing George W. Bush to Bill Clinton. They're saying that George W. Bush has accomplished more in his first 100 days as president. But everyone agrees that.it was more fun under President Clinton. Unless, of course, you were actually under President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Social Insecurity news, President George W. Bush appointed former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and AOL-Time Warner President Richard Parsons in charge of a new committee that will attempt to reform our nation's Social Security system. Good 'strategery,' George.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush would have been on the committee, but there's something else he has to do first.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;I want to learn to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Detractors of the new committee say he hired the AOL-Time Warner president just so he would get the HBO special on dwarves piped into the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush has picked one of his old fraternity brothers to be ambassador to China, which surprised a lot of people, including me, because I thought he couldn't remember anything about his college years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, Bush's 19-year-old daughter, Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush, was.busted last week and charged with underage drinking. Hey, let me tell you. Let me tell you something. After eight years of Bill Clinton, I think it is refreshing to see a young woman under a table because they passed out for a change. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the New York Post, Al Gore said, 'Whether I'm a candidate ever again or not, I will reenter the public arena and fight for the causes that are dear to me.' And if you've seen Al Gore lately, you know he's going to be fighting in a heavier weight division next time out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, he's gained, like, 40 -- close to 50 pounds in, like, three months. What is that? Now, he says he's gonna write a book. He says the book will be about what made him the man he is today. So apparently, it's a cookbook, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, trying to attract more immigrants there. They want more immigrants to move to Pittsburgh because they have a serious shortage of immigrants. You know, if they want more immigrants, they should do what we do here in California. Put up fences. Hire border guards. Put up highway checkpoints. Immigrants love that when they see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This sounds like a joke. This is not a joke. There is now a lobbying group in Washington called the 'Pink Pistols.' It is a pro-gay, pro- gun organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't that unbelievable? Pro-gay, pro-gun. Their slogan is, 'That is a gun in our pocket, and we are happy to see you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This week, People magazine named First Lady Laura Bush one of the '50 most beautiful people.' And President Bush agreed, saying he's known that for years. Isn't that nice? Yeah, President Bush said, 'I knew Laura was beautiful the moment Dick Cheney told me she was.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is kind of interesting. Al Gore...Vice President Al Gore -- ring a bell? He finished up his journalism class at Columbia University. You know, all winter and spring he was teaching a class there at Columbia University. And he finished it up today. And you know what that means? That means that this -- right here, what you're watching right now -- this now is the dullest hour in Manhattan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore's a nice guy, but boy, did he balloon after the election. Did you notice that? When he's out there on the campaign trail, it was like him and Tipper, you know, the all-American couple and he was looking pretty good. He looked slim, ready to go, like he could handle himself. And now, I mean, he's gained like 60 pounds, honest to God. He is so fat, earlier today, his pants conceded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The world champion New York Yankees -- do you know what the did today? They went down to the White House to meet President Bush, and it was another typical day in the Bush Administration. Dick Cheney was running everything. George Bush was getting a ball autographed by Tino Martinez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Chuck Knoblauch was in the White House. 'Big deal,' I said to myself, 'he's the not first guy to drop a fly in the Oval Office.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A lot of health news. Doctors for Dick Cheney say if his heart problems progress more seriously, he may have to have his heart removed.  The good news is he can still be a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Spent 13 hours at the table one night. 13 hours at the table. Whoo, sounds like Al Gore having dinner, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ooh, some good political gossip. Seems there's a new woman in Al Gore's life. Yeah, Betty Crocker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore has gained 50 pounds now. It was 40 a couple of days ago.  Gained 50 pounds. In fact, he told students at Columbia University he may never run again. Unless of course the ice cream truck goes by, but other than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This weekend, George W. Bush will become the first President in US history to deliver his weekly radio address from the Oval Office entirely in Spanish. I guess he realized, 'Look, this English thing isn't working out for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And because of the energy crisis, President Bush has ordered all Federal agencies in California to turn up the thermostats to 78 degrees to conserve electricity. Is that a good idea? As if postal workers aren't irritated enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and a Federal grand jury in Cleveland indicted Ohio Congressman James Traficant. Here he is. You probably saw this on the news. He's been charged with bribery, tax violation, obstruction of justice and having the worst haircut, ladies and gentlemen, in congressional history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know it's bad when people say, 'Shave that off and get a toupee, will you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There a new lobbying group in Washington called the Pink Pistols.  I'm not making this up. They are pro-gay and pro-gun. Isn't that unbelievable? Pro-gay and pro-gun. They believe there should be no waiting period to buy a firearm at the Pottery Barn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big Cinco de Mayo celebration is this weekend. This town goes nuts. It celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over the French. It's a good thing they won. Imagine if the French had won, huh? Imagine if the French had Mexico, huh? We'd have illegal immigrants that were rude, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's a pretty strong field this year, down there in Louisville (for the Kentucky Derby). Dollar Bill, Thunder Blitz, Jamaica Rum, Arctic Boy...oh, no, wait a minute. I'm sorry. Those are Bush's Cabinet nicknames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was so hot today, Bill Clinton dropped his pants without propositioning anyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'You're all a bunch of cheaters' news, George W. Bush hosted a party for the New York Yankees today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Cinco de Mayo, everywhere you went over the weekend, there's people drinking these huge margaritas, you know? You ever wonder who this girl Margarita was? You ever think about that, huh? I mean, she gets a drink named after her. Isn't that every father's worst nightmare, knowing your daughter is so wild, they have a drink named after her? In fact, last night, I had a couple of 'Jenna Bushes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Shell and Chevron are telling gas station owners in Chicago and California to get ready for $3-a-gallon gas this summer. Gee, I wonder how they know that ahead of time, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Rep. James Traficant will &quot;be the first guy in history to get a better haircut in prison. He looks like Joe Dirt, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yogi Berra and President Bush are.you know, there are similarities there. Here's the difference between President Bush and Yogi Berra. When President Bush says something that doesn't make any sense, it doesn't make any sense. That's the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This weekend, because of Cinco de Mayo, President George Bush delivered the speech in English and also in Spanish. And Bush spoke very slowly, very haltingly -- and that was the English part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush's favorite movie is that Billy Crystal '61*,' you know, because Bush is the President with an asterisk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;One of the changes that George W. Bush made at the White House, you cannot get into the Oval Office unless you're wearing a tie. That didn't used to be the case. For example, when Clinton was the President, to get into the Oval Office...all you really needed was a bib.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush invited two T-ball teams to play on the White House lawn. . Many were in attendance, including former Vice President Al Gore, who played left out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The most exciting play of the game was when little Tommy hit a ball down the third base line and Vice President Cheney had heart palpitations and was again rushed to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, we started our surveillance planes off the coast of China again. It's a good thing, too. You know, with the price of gas, maybe we can steal some of China's rickshaw technology.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This past weekend, President Bush hosted a tee-ball game on the White House lawn for 5-year-old and 6-year-old kids. You know, they're not sure which team won. I guess, because it's tee-ball, you don't actually keep score. You know, kind of like the voting in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in the state of Massachusetts -- the governor is pregnant with twins. Congratulations. Critics are asking if she can handle her pregnancy and her job at the same time. And a lot of women's groups are very upset, saying if she were a man, nobody would be asking those questions. Really? I mean, if she were a man having twins? Geez, I'd like a few questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company says they are developing a new drug to compete with Viagra. They say this new drug will last 20 hours longer than Viagra. 20 hours! And today, Elizabeth Dole went into hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;On Saturday, Cliff Hillegass, who was the creator of Cliff's Notes, which some of you may remember from college.passed away at age 83. Yeah, and after hearing this, President Bush was quoted as saying, &quot; That's too bad, he was my favorite author.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The end of the world came closer as Fidel Castro made the first visit to the peaceful country of Iran. Is it possible to overdose on evil?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Castro says he went to Iran to learn about their form of government because he never wants to stop growing as a malicious tyrant. Bush sent his regards to the two despots, saying 'We have much in common, since I wasn't democratically elected either.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush is working on the problem. Today, he introduced his new idea for energy conservation. He bought his daughter Jenna one of those foam rubber things you put your beer in to keep it cold, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, today is the 40th anniversary of the day the FDA approved the sale of birth control pills. And today, Jesse Jackson said, 'They have pills that can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that in the past year, the number of cases of syphilis in New York has risen sharply. True story. Yeah. Yeah, and after hearing this, President Clinton said, 'Have I been here a year already?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney, our Vice President, he was on a program the other night talking about his health. And you know he's had half a dozen heart attacks. And he's always going back in for, you know, tune-up work and that kind of thing. And he said now that he may, in the future, have to have another procedure. And I was thinking I...you know, I miss the old White House. I miss Clinton. You remember the procedures he was getting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Former President Clinton, by the way, is in China now, pretending he's still President and he's already learned a lot of Chinese. For example, 'dim sum,' 'dim sum,' you know what that means? That's a Chinese word for lunch. The 'dim sum,' that means lunch. Now, 'Dim Son,' that's a Chinese word for President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Today show broadcast live from Bangkok as part of their annual series 'Where in the World is Matt Lauer?' True story. He was in Bangkok, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Al Gore visited Florida for the first time since the presidential election. Yeah, and I think Gore is still bitter because he began his speech yesterday by saying, 'Greetings, you stupid, old fools.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bill Clinton's enduring popularity was evident when he addressed the global execs&quot; at a Hong Kong conference &quot;on how to get two girls at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush has appointed a new drug policy director, a gentleman by the name of John P. Walters, who is known for his tough approach to fighting drugs. In fact, he'll be George W. Bush's first drug adviser since college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Great Britain is now considering knighting former President Bill Clinton. They want to make him a knight. And they do the whole knighthood ceremony with the Queen. You know how that works, with the sword. Boy, that's a switch, huh? Clinton kneeling in front of a woman for a change.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, even though Bill Clinton would be called a 'knight,' it's only an honorary title. It's an honorary title. It's just for show. You know, like when Hillary calls him 'my husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the acting Governor of my home state of Massachusetts, a woman named Jane Swift, is pregnant, expecting twins any minute. Could be this weekend. And they said she's been having cravings in the middle of the night. You know, for all kinds of food. Chocolates and pineapple sundaes. And egg and peanut butter sandwiches. And butterscotch and raspberry pudding. Oh, no -- That's Al Gore I'm thinking of. That's Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The White House announced that President Bush recently submitted to a urine test. That's right. Yeah, and not surprisingly, before taking the test, the President wrote the correct answers on his hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;There's a rumor in Britain right now that President Clinton is going to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth. It's a real rumor. That's right. Yeah, if you think about it, it's really odd, because usually women are on their knees in front of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Also very good in the talent competition&quot; for the Miss Universe pageant: &quot;Miss China. She took apart a spy plane and put it back together all by herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, American husbands sent a record 10 million roses to their wives, and that was just Governor Jeb Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's the big story. There have been rumors swirling around Florida that Florida Governor Jeb Bush had been cheating on his wife. That was the rumor. But he says no. He says, 'not true.' He says, technically, he wasn't cheating. They only had dimple sex. That's where it doesn't go all the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He especially denied having an affair with Florida Secretary -- oh, what's her name -- Secretary of State Katherine Harris. Remember that woman? I believe him. I don't think he did. An affair with Katherine Harris? How much makeup would that leave on your collar, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Jeb Bush &quot;said, as a Republican, the only people he's been in bed with are the tobacco industry and the gun lobby. Yeah! There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Great Britain is considering knighting former President Bill Clinton. How about that, huh? And that's not all. Because he committed adultery, cheated and had a bunch of loser relatives who never had a job in their lives, he's also being made an honorary member of the royal family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Top 10 Little Known Facts About Jeb Bush: &quot;10. He's so dumb, he used to cheat off George in school. 9. Turn-ons: Long walks, romantic dinners and rigging elections for his brother. 8. Parents named him after great American Jebraham Lincoln. 7. He and his brothers get chicks by going to bars and saying that they're the Baldwins. 6. Was the one who told Katherine Harris, 'Don't be stingy with the mascara.' 5. Can outwrestle every member of Bush family except Barbara. 4. He was the last man to see Eisenhower alive. 3. Did have a relationship with Miss June back in 1968, but she wasn't present. 2. Even if he has a hundred more scandals, George W. will still be the embarrassing one in the family. 1. Has bumper sticker that reads 'Don't blame me - I voted for Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is &quot;denying rumors of an extramarital affair. He claims now he's never dangled his chad in front of anyone, ladies and gentlemen -- anyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, they said they don't really know how many women he's been with, because since it's Florida, they're still counting.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Talk about switches, huh? During the last Administration, the President was accused of infidelity and his brother was an idiot. Now, it's the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Great Britain, now considering knighting Bill Clinton. Well, that's very nice. But didn't he pretty much get the royal treatment from Monica?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: A &quot;runaway train in Ohio -- this train, running, it was a runaway train. It was like a bad movie. It was carrying hazardous material. When they finally stopped it, nobody was on board the train. So it was moving forward, endangering the environment, yet nobody was in charge. You know, kind of like the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in a surprising decision, the Supreme Court has thrown out all the laws legalizing marijuana. How about that? Oh, I tell ya something. In fact, pot smokers are so outraged, many of them came this close to getting off the couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We're getting the results of the latest census and it proves now, statistically, more Americans are living in non-traditional households than ever before. And that's just in Gracie Mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I didn't realize this, but in New York City, the Mayor's mistress can only serve one two-year term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's been in all the papers. The Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, brother of George W. Bush.now, there's rumors that he allegedly had an affair with a member of his staff who's a former Playboy playmate. And Jeb Bush, the Governor says, 'It is absolutely not true.' So you know, of course, that it is true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Having an affair, so apparently he's been handling more things than the ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story, in 'looks like a Bush, sounds like a Clinton' news. Florida Governor Jeb Bush adamantly denies rumors that he had a long term affair with a woman on his staff named Cynthia Henderson. Well, at least he's still not banging chads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush says the rumors have been started by political enemies who are just jealous that he gets so much tail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In the wake of the allegations against Jeb Bush, another victim has come forward alleging that he too, was screwed by the Florida Governor.&quot; (A picture of Al Gore was shown.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush has yet to comment on the alleged extramarital affair, trying not to embarrass his family by pronouncing the word 'extramarital.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Congratulations to Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift. She gave birth to twin girls yesterday, the first time a Governor has given birth to twins. She got a lot of calls. Governor Jeb Bush, from Florida, called her -- not to congratulate her, just to deny that he was the father.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Florida Governor Jeb Bush went on TV the other day to deny rumors that he had a sexual relationship with a former Playboy playmate. He went on to deny it. Oh, as a guy, that's gotta kill you, doesn't it? Huh? Having to deny to your friends that you had sex with a playmate even if you did, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a recent report, Americans spend more money on pornography than we do on political campaigns. . Last year, we spent $11 billion on pornography and only $1.2 billion on politics. See, that was the great thing about Bill Clinton -- with him, you got both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Clinton has agreed to speak at the graduation festivities of the New York Professional Performing Arts School after he got a flattering letter from a 17-year-old girl saying how much she love him and admired him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Louisiana state Legislature, now considering a new law that would legalize sodomy in that state. But the papers are reporting the conservative groups have lined up in opposition. Not lined up too closely, obviously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Supreme Court has thrown out all the laws legalizing marijuana. No more legalizing of marijuana. And, of course, people are shocked. Well, it is shocking. Well, when you think about it, Supreme Court judges have a lot in common with pot smokers, huh? I mean, they're both kind of sleepy. They both only work part of the year. They both sit around in their robes all day. It's the same people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, true story, Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift became the first US governor ever to give birth to twins while in office. How cool is that? . Yeah, coincidentally, 15 years ago in Arkansas, Bill Clinton became the first US Governor to sleep with twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Supreme Court ruled this week that smoking marijuana is illegal in the US no matter what the circumstances. Yeah, apparently, the decision was handed down in the case of the US vs. Cheech &amp; Chong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to new government data, true story, one out of every five adults in the US needs cholesterol-lowering drugs. One out of five.  Yeah, and critics say Americans don't really need the cholesterol drugs. They're just trying to look vice presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's been so dry, today President Clinton was chafed by an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;An 18-year-old high school student wrote&quot; former President Clinton &quot;a letter asking him to deliver the commencement address at her high school. Well, actually it wasn't just a letter, it was a couple of polaroids that went along with it, but...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;It's been reported that Ted Kennedy is splitting up with his wife and will soon be a free man again. Oh, the mummy returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush's daughter, his 19-year-old daughter, Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush, pleaded no contest to a charge of being a minor in possession of alcohol. She must now attend alcohol awareness classes. Hey, I think she's aware of the alcohol, huh? How about some alcohol avoidance classes?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Former President Clinton was &quot;walking down the streets, waving to people, when a raw egg was thrown by a protester and hit him. . Boy, that's depressing, isn't it? I mean, one day, you're President of the US. The Secret Service has to take a bullet for you. The minute you leave office, they won't even take an egg for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Luckily, you know, Clinton is an expert at getting out stains, so it's not a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Great Britain, now thinking of knighting former President Clinton. How about that? And today, Clinton told the royal family, 'Forget about knighting me. Just get me an intern with Prince Charles' ears.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Post is saying that Senator Ted Kennedy's marriage is on the rocks. Whoa. I think everything Ted has is on the rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that President Clinton -- true story - - has lost 20 pounds since leaving office. That's pretty impressive. 20 pounds - just gone away, just melted. That's right. Yeah, and when asked about it, the former President pointed at Hillary and said, 'I'd like to lose 140 more.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton has lost 20 pounds since he was in office. Pretty good, isn't it? 20 pounds. He's dropped 20 pounds. He said he knew he was overweight. He said he knew he needed to go on a diet because the last trip he took, he couldn't get into the lavatory with a flight attendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Clinton is thrilled that he's lost all this weight, because finally now, he's able to get into his own pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story from the monosyllabic world of the President. President Bush released his long-awaited energy plan in a lengthy speech in Minnesota. Hey, Georgie, turn down the charisma, you're wasting energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The speech would have been shorter but Bush spent half an hour wrestling with the words 'nuclear physicist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;His plan includes 105 recommendations to help the energy crisis. And California heard 38 of them before the power went out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Reacting to the President's energy proposal, Dick Cheney experienced heart palpitations and was rushed to a hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A stripper who was linked to that FBI agent -- you know the one who was arrested for spying, this terrible man, this Robert Hanssen guy? .  She said they never had any kind of sexual contact or relationship. She said he tried to convince her to change her life. He wanted to get her to stop stripping and start going to church. Let me tell you something about this Hanssen guy, okay? Being a traitor to your country is one thing. But trying to convince women to stop taking their clothes off, that is un-American.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In a speech in St. Paul, Minnesota, 300 protesters called President Bush a tool of the big energy companies and an enemy of the environment. And Bush said, 'Oh, thanks.' He thought it was a compliment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to today's issue of USA Today, President bush has prayed every single day since he was elected. Well, who hasn't? There's not a day I don't get down on my knees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Clinton was hit by an egg thrown by a protester as he was walking down the street in Poland. Hit by an egg. Isn't that something? And his reflexes were so quick, he was able to fertilize it like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, good thing Al Gore wasn't around when the egg was thrown. He's gained so much weight, he might have caught it and eaten it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I guess according to the New York Daily News, Bill Clinton has lost 20 pounds. 20 pounds! He's now so thin, his pants fall down even if there's not a woman in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's a lot, 20 pounds. You know what that means? For the first time in eight years, Clinton now weighs less than any of his girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, toward the end of his term in office,&quot; former President Clinton &quot;started to puff up. He ballooned, he got heavy. He was fat, really. And since then...since he's been out of office, he's dropped 20 pounds. He's dropped 20 pounds. Pretty good for him, and he does it with a strict exercise regimen: Every day he works out for an hour on a stationary intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big story here in California, this stupid power shortage we've been having. And today, the governor issued some tips for citizens of Los Angeles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if you're -- let's say you're in a tanning center during the next blackout -- if you're in a tanning center and the lights go out, don't panic. You can still go outside and continue to tan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In political news, this weekend, the reverend Al Sharpton announced he is going to run for president of the United States in the year 2004. Well, finally -- finally a Democrat who can restore some dignity to the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, President Bush gave the commencement address at Notre Dame. Yeah, well, I guess Bush figures, if O.J. Can give advice to Robert Blake, Bush can give advice to college students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush received an honorary degree from Yale, his alma mater. In his address -- this is what Bush said -- 'cause he was not a very good student. Bush said he's living proof that even 'C' students can grow up to be President of the United States. See, you gotta hand it to our presidents, don't you? First, Clinton lowered our moral standards. Now, Bush is lowering our academic standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former attorney general Janet Reno said she may run for governor of Florida against Jeb Bush. Oh, hey, she could be tough to beat. She's got a great slogan -- 'Janet Reno -- the best man for the job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They asked her what she thinks about the rumors ... going around that Jeb Bush may have had an affair with a former 'Playboy' playmate. Janet Reno said, 'Hey, that lucky son of a gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ford says they don't want to deal with Firestone anymore 'cause, they say, it's too risky to use defective rubber. And today, Jesse Jackson said, 'Oh, tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, President George W. Bush returned to Yale University, his alma mater, where he gave the commencement address. He also received an honorary law degree. In fact, he said it was just like the old days. You know, he didn't set foot in the classroom to get this one, either.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush said this degree was extra-special to him 'cause this one, he actually remembers getting. He doesn't remember the first one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big rumor in Washington is that Senator James Jeffords of Vermont may switch parties, giving Democrats control of the Senate. That's the big rumor. Yeah, yeah. See, that would still leave the House controlled by the Republicans and, of course, the White House controlled by the oil companies. So you'd still have that balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Sharpton announced he's gonna run for President. How 'bout that? As a Democrat, which would pit him against Al Gore. So you got two chubby guys named Al.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I'm coming in today, and I hear on the radio -- I hear this ad, 'Built ram tough!' Have you heard that? 'Built ram tough!' And I thought, 'Oh, it's a truck commercial.' Turns out, it's the new Janet Reno for governor slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new book by former First Lady Ladybird Johnson -- you know, LBJ's wife -- she says she not only knew about her husband's affairs, she was okay with them. She didn't mind. Isn't it amazing? The book is called 'Hidden Power.' That's the name of the book. Please, don't confuse it with the book on Clinton and his affairs. That's called 'Hidden Salami.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush was the commencement speaker at Yale University . and this is the good part -- 170 professors signed a letter of protest. Yeah, and when asked about it, the President said, 'That's nothing. When I graduated, 300 professors signed a letter of protest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Pentagon has been accused of wasting money because they sent a huge aircraft carrier from San Diego to Hawaii for the premiere of the movie Pearl Harbor. People are upset. Not only that -- this is worse -- the government spent $1 million transporting Strom Thurmond to the premiere of 'The Mummy Returns.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that Janet Reno -- do you remember Janet Reno? Janet Reno is considering running for governor of Florida. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Reno will not reveal if she's gonna run as a Democrat, independent, man or woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, up in New Haven, President Bush gave the commencement address and they gave him an honorary law degree. So that means now he's an honorary ... he's an honorary lawyer, you know, just like he's an honorary President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Monica Lewinsky wants her stained dress back. Apparently, all of her other stained dresses are too tight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then Clinton, President Clinton gets into it, and he's trying to do, you know, trying to do the gentlemanly thing and he said, 'Look, if you can't get your stained dress back,' this is Clinton talking, he says, 'I'll make you a new one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Pieces of Advice George W. Bush Gave to the Graduates: 10. You can't expect to function on less than 16 hours of sleep per night. 9. If you don't know a foreign leader's name, call him 'Pierre.' 8.  If you're not making more than your professors two years from now, you're doing something wrong. 7. The Internet is a great place to find speeches you can pass off as your own. 6. Drinking and partying all the time will jeopardize your future. Just kidding! 5. I've always wanted to do this: 'Now batting for the Rangers, #3, Alex Rodriguez!' 4. If you're a male cheerleader, destroy all photographs of yourself. 3. Do any of you want to be president? I'm already sick of it. 2. Don't challenge my mom Barbara to a fistfight. She'll kick your ass. 1. Move to Mexico, because I'm gonna run this country into the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like this summer, Californians will get early warnings of blackouts. Here's the bad news -- the early warnings are June, July and August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Sen. James Jeffords is &quot;leaving the Republican Party and is going to become an independent. . That's very smart. The independent, you got the best of both worlds. See, independent, you can still have extramarital affairs, like a Democrat, but still take money from big oil, like a Republican.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the latest mini-scandal to hit Washington -- it seems the other night, the Bush Administration held a big party at Dick Cheney's vice presidential mansion for people who had given over $100,000 to the Republican Party. See, originally, he wanted to hold the party at the White House, but the donors that gave $100,000 said to Cheney, they said, 'No, no. For the kind of money we're spending, we want to meet the top guy, the man in charge.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems Janet Reno said she may run for governor of Florida. Yeah, yeah. She said she's getting sick and tired of playing the Jolly Green Giant at kids' birthday parties every Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Vice President Al Gore and former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander have agreed to teach a one-day seminar at Vanderbilt University this summer. Wow, Al Gore and Lamar Alexander. Oh, man. Isn't that a little like mixing Nyquil with Tylenol PM?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, when those two stand in a room together, they can actually create negative charisma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush met with the Dalai Lama today. . You know what's interesting about this whole Dalai Lama thing? I'm watching the news today, and I see this guy walking around the White House wearing nothing but a bed sheet. And for a second, I thought, 'Oh, Clinton's back in town.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, lawyers for Monica Lewinsky said that Monica Lewinsky wants the government to return her stained blue dress. She wants the dress back. Apparently, she is under some illusion that she can still fit in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anyway, they say the stained dress could be worth $500,000. No, see, I was thinking about this. Now, Clinton gets what, $100,000, for an hour speech? He's in the wrong business. Isn't he? What does it take, two minutes, to stain a dress? That's $500,000. He could make millions without even leaving the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Apparently, the White House says they've given up hopes of flying our damaged spy plane home from China, and instead, they'll have to pack the plane into crates and ship it home. . Yeah, on the bright side, each crate sent from China will contain extra duck sauce and a fortune cookie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Republican Senator Jim Jeffords said yesterday that he's thinking about switching to a different political party. Could be a big story, yeah. Reportedly, Democrats have offered him a $50 rebate and 100 minutes of free long distance calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, down in Washington, the Dalai Lama visited President George Bush at the White House. And it was a nice day. The Dalai Lama actually brought his son along, Dalai W. Lama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was a long afternoon for the Dalai Lama. He had to sit through a T- ball double header.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Senator Jim Jeffords from Vermont announced, I guess late yesterday, he's changing parties, no longer going to be a Republican; thinking maybe he'll be an independent. So he's changing parties. But you know, it's not unusual for senators to change parties. For example, last night, Ted Kennedy went from a party at Bennigan's to a party at Houlihan's. So it happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This Senator Jeffords says the reason he's leaving the Republican Party, he's just fed up with George Bush and the tax cut, and he's also fed up with his environmental policies, but the big reason he said, the Democrats offered to let him get in on some of that hot intern action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Some Republicans are outraged at the proposed switch and have already labeled (Sen.) Jeffords a 'Benedict Heche.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush met with Jeffords Tuesday to try to keep him in the party, which can only mean one thing -- he's officially a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After the switch, Democrats would have 51 seats, Republicans would have 49 seats, and Senator Ted Kennedy would still need four seats.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Everything's changed in Washington. I guess today, Senator James Jeffords, from Vermont, left the Republican Party, became an independent. . He said he did it to follow his conscience and his principles. See, that's why he became an independent. If you have a conscience and principles, you can't be a Republican or a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the Senate was 50/50. And him leaving, this gives the Democrats more votes, you seen this means that in the Senate, there will be more votes for Democrats than Republicans. You know, just like the presidential election.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jeffords was considered what they call a liberal Republican. You know what that is, a liberal Republican? That's a Republican that still believes in the death penalty, but only if the electric chair is solar-power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Next week, President Bush is going to make his first visit to California since becoming President. Not for political reasons -- Dick Cheney's taking him to Disneyland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dick Cheney today called for the construction of new nuclear plants, and he called for the swift re-licensing of older plants to increase the power supply. He said the American people have a choice -- you can either sit in the dark, or you can glow in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other day, Mayor Giuliani's office made it public that the Mayor is impotent. Why do I have to know that? Don't you love politicians nowadays? They'll tell you they're impotent. They'll tell you they're sex addicts. 'I'm an alcoholic. I've smoked dope. I use crack.' But you ask him, 'What's your position on campaign finance form?' 'I don't feel it's appropriate to go into that right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Reverend Al Sharpton, who was down in Puerto Rico last week protesting military exercises on the island, has been arrested. The judge sentenced him to 90 days in jail. 90 days in jail. However, they released him a couple hours later, when they realized, 'Hey, we can't afford to feed this guy. Come on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush gave a speech today, and he said he would respect Senator Jim Jeffords' decision to switch parties. That's what he said.  Yeah. Bush said, 'It's no big deal -- in college, I switched parties every time the keg ran out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush met with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. They had a meeting. Yeah, and the meeting went well, even though George W. kept calling the Dalai Lama 'Jackie Chan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier today, Anne Heche held a press conference to announce that she's leaving the lesbians to become an independent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords is leaving the Republican Party to become an independent. And this...this, I want to tell you something. This is bad news for George Bush and the Republicans. And this guy knew it, and he didn't see it coming and he's desperate now. And at the last minute, he tried everything he could to keep this guy from defecting. He even offered to make him Commissioner of Tee-ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Senator Jeffords switching parties is kind of like me coming from NBC to CBS, except in this case, it might work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush said that he is not worried about the Republicans having less votes in the Senate. And why...why should he? Having less votes never stopped him before, did it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today, Mayor Giuliani fired his wife as official hostess at Gracie Mansion. Fired his wife. When President Clinton heard about that, he said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton, by the way, is in Ireland. You know, he's traveling around the world. He's in Ireland right now and he's very excited because, I understand he flew in on Aer Lingus and...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Signs Your Senator Has Lost It: 10. Only voting he does is on MTV's 'Total Request Live.' 9. Claims to be senator from the 'Great State of Margaritaville.' 8. During Debates, speaks only through a hand puppet made of his hairpiece. 7. Instead of voting 'yea' or 'nay', only voted 'nyay.' 6. Publicly fights with wife about his mistress (Oh, I'm sorry, that's a sign your mayor has lost it). 5. Supports 'dress down Friday's by showing up to work naked. 4. Describes George W. Bush as the 'greatest President in the history of the United States of America.' 3. Only interested in capturing the 'Monkey Man' vote. 2. During TV interviews, says things like: (A clip of Sen. Joseph Lieberman was shown) 'I'm going to raise your taxes so I can buy myself a sweet Camaro.' 1. Asks the floor to recognize the 'junior Senator in his pants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President George W. Bush is not worried (about Jeffords' party switch), pointing out that getting fewer votes has not hurt him before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here in California -- this is very nice. The utility companies have promised to give us two hours' notice before we are left completely without power. The same deal Senator Jeffords gave the Republicans.  'We'll give you two hours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's interesting why (Jeffords) became an independent. He left the Republicans because he said didn't like their policies on energy and the environment. He didn't want to join the Democrats because he's not ready to start screwing around on his wife.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you know this has upset the delicate 50/50 balance they had in Congress -- half Republican and half Democrat. Now the Democrats control the Senate. But the good news - the Republicans can finally admit that Strom Thurmond's been dead since 1988.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jim Jeffords told President Bush -- he said he made the switch because, as an independent, he doesn't have to answer to anyone. And Bush said, 'Really? Not even Dick Cheney? How do you do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, it got pretty nasty. At one point, Jim Jeffords said today -- he said he personally told George Bush that 'You would be a one-term President.' . Bush fired back, 'Well, how many years does that come to?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Dalai Lama visited President Bush at the White House this week. And a reporter asked, 'How does it feel to be a leader not really in charge of a country, and Bush said, 'It's okay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, one kind of embarrassing moment -- this is kind of funny. I guess, when the Dalai Lama met with President Bush, the Dalai Lama mentioned Tibet. And Bush said, 'Ah, I put 50 bucks on the Lakers once in awhile, but.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Janet Reno got a new job today. See this -- she's the spokesman for (Brawny) Paper Towels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the price of gas going up again because of Memorial Day weekend. What a coincidence, huh? I'll tell you how expensive gas is. Today in New York, Giuliani, his wife and his mistress were all car- pooling together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Reverend Al Sharpton, who is running for President -- our friend, the Reverend Al, said he and his wife are going to renew their wedding vows. Which I think is nice. But you know something? Wait a minute. I never understood this renewing your wedding vows thing. Because couples who renew their vows are always the ones that are most in love anyway, right? Those are the ones that are most faithful. There's no reason for them to renew their vows. They should be for people like the Clintons, you know? People who need to renew like five, six times a year. You know, like it's a booster shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Jesse Jackson now threatening to boycott Toyota. Yeah, yeah. He's claiming the backseat is too short for two people to lie down comfortably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's another odd story. A 450-pound woman in leg irons escaped from police in Connecticut. Police are hoping to apprehend her before she can start dating Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: Sen. Jim Jeffords &quot;made big news when he switched political parties. Everyone was talking about it. And then, it was pointed out that Strom Thurmond once switched parties. That's a true story. Yeah, apparently, years ago, Strom switched from the Hunters to the Gatherers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This week, Democrats were really angry. Democrat's criticized Republicans because Republicans invited all their rich donors to Dick Cheney's vice presidential mansion for a private party. And people thought that was wrong. And folks, even worse, for $100,000 extra, Cheney let the donors practice CPR on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We have a very exciting program for you tonight. The entire balcony is filled with former members of the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday the Republicans had a defection. Jim Jeffords from Vermont is leaving the Republican Party to become an independent. And this kind of thing really, real, really upset George W. Bush and the rest of the Republicans. And they tried, when they got wind of this thing, when they heard it was happening, they tried, they did everything. They even arranged for him to have dinner with Robert Blake. That didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;New York City, Memorial Day weekend, it is empty. It is so empty. It's as empty as the expression on George Bush's face during a foreign policy question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Former President Clinton is &quot;in Ireland, and I understand today that he actually kissed the Blarney Stone. President Clinton kissed the Blarney Stone. And I thought, 'Well, that's a switch, Clinton hanging upside down to kiss something.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Colin Powell is in Africa on a mission in part to smooth trade relations, but in part to brief President Bush before he sees the Lion King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Bill Clinton world tour continued this week with a stop in Great Britain amid rumors that the former President is looking for a house in Ireland. Erin go braless. That sounds like a party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Clinton is spending all his time in England, where he is affectionately known as 'Sir Bangs-a-lot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What a crowd! Man! This sounds like a party in Jenna Bush's dorm room. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you know how old you have to be to drink alcohol in Texas? Neither do the Bush girls!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;When Clinton left, I thought it was over. Thank God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;No, the President's daughter, Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush, as you know, she's back in the news again. This time, for trying to buy alcohol with a fake ID. Well, it's nice to see those alcohol awareness classes really paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How dumb is a fake ID? You're the President's daughter. Did you really think the bartender was gonna go, 'Let's see, you're Mary Wong, a 43- year-old Asian businesswoman? Is that correct?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Where do you think those Secret Service agents are working now, huh? They're probably guarding Socks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, former First Lady Barbara Bush said that Jenna is just like George was when he was that age. You think the President's in the White House right now going, 'Ma, shut up?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's the basic difference between the Bush family and the Clinton family. Here it is in a nutshell, okay? When Bill Clinton said it was time for a cold one, he meant Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, anyway, this past weekend, I guess the entire Bush family got together, and they went to see the movie Pearl Harbor. That's a switch, huh? The Bushes watching somebody else get bombed for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what the secret code name is now for Jenna Bush? Roger Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush told Florida officials today he was surprised they have blackouts in that state, too. So then somebody told him, 'Uh, Mr. President, it's just nighttime.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, down in Washington, DC, they had their second T-ball game on the White House lawn, the T-ball game, second T-ball game. Quite an accomplishment for the Administration, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think the last T-ball President was Herbert Hoover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Things were going great until the seventh inning, when they had to cut off beer sales to the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush spent the weekend with his daughters, Jenna and Barbara -- or as they're better known, J &amp; B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, one of his daughters -- well, underage daughters -- was caught trying to buy liquor with a fake ID. It was a complete mix-up. She was just buying it for he dad. That's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Bush girls have been in so much trouble that today they announced that they were switching their party affiliation to the Kennedy family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

If you're not 16, don't worry. Jenna Bush will get you a fake ID.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know why the Bush girls like being twins? 'Cause nobody likes to drink alone. Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush's twin daughters, Bartles and Jaymes, are in trouble again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, today, the Secret Service changed their code names to 'Tastes Great' and 'Less Filling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess they got in trouble again for trying to buy beer at a local restaurant down there in Austin. But, you know, you can't blame the girls. I mean, they're under a lot of pressure. You know how hard it is for them to try and stagger in their father's footsteps?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush spoke openly about it today. . He said he suspected something was up when he would call his daughters and they would answer the phone and go, 'Whassup!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The White House released their financial disclosure forms. Turns out Vice President Dick Cheney.is worth somewhere between $20 million and $69 million. That's a pretty big margin of error there, allowing these - - you know, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Somewhere between $20 million and $69 million. Try being that vague on your tax return. Okay, huh? 'Cause maybe you'll be serving somewhere between 10 and 25 years in prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, President Bush was in Florida at the Everglades, where he said, 'The destruction of the environment is not inevitable.' He said it requires the cooperation of the oil, companies, the coal companies and nuclear power all working together as a common goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Sharpton is now on a hunger strike. And his doctor said today, at his current weight, if he continues this hunger strike, he could be dead within 40 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;For the second time in a week, President Bush made an appearance at one of our national parks, and he announced a new environmental program. Isn't that nice? . And it should be a really effective program. President Bush is going to recycle all his daughter's beer bottles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Vanity Fair magazine reports that former President Clinton and Al Gore haven't spoken to each other since George W. Bush's inauguration. They're not speaking. Yeah, and folks, not only that, Bill and his wife Hillary haven't spoken since Richard Nixon's inauguration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush yesterday gave a pro-environment speech down in the Florida Everglades. . One embarrassing moment during the speech: A bunch of old Al Gore ballots floated by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George Bush referred to the Florida Everglades as a beautiful piece of heaven. You know what that means? They're getting ready to drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I, myself, am an environmentalist. Most of these jokes are recycled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;While George W. Bush was in Florida, he help build a house in Tampa. And I thought, well, this is good. It's nice to see a President hammering something that won't get him impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush was in Tampa, Florida, helping to build a new home with the folks at Habitat for Humanity. . When he saw the President working up a sweat, Vice President Dick Cheney experienced heart palpitations and was rushed to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush says working for Habitat for Humanity is to lull poor people into a false sense of security before screwing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Democrat James Hahn was elected in a runoff election, where he got 54% of the votes. 54% or, as George W. Bush calls it, a landslide.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Because of term limits, our current Mayor, Richard Riordan, had to step down. So after today, he's like every other Californian. He doesn't have any power, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday in Florida, President Bush announced a major environmental initiative. He's going to have his daughters recycle all their beer cans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I mean, the way it is going, Bush's daughters aren't going to remember their college years, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, earlier tonight, there were some diplomats over at the White House -- you know, one of those big state dinner things. And I guess one of the diplomats went to take a sip of wine, and Bush's daughters starting chanting, 'chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, we do these jokes, but you got to feel sorry for President Bush, 'cause that's a tough predicament. What can he say to his kids? He can't tell them, 'Look, you spend your whole college career partying and drinking, you'll never amount to anything.' He can't say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Lakers and 76ers are beginning the NBA finals tonight. Ad as usual, you know, both states' governors have made friendly wagers. Did you know this? This is where each state sends something the other one needs. Like, if the 76ers win, LA will send Philly some silicone implants, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And if the Lakers win, they have to send us some electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush's niece, Lauren, has begun a modeling career, and she's gonna appear on the cover of a magazine called Tattler. Isn't that nice? I think that's sweet news. Very nice. Yeah, meanwhile President Bush's daughters will appear on the cover of a magazine called 'Glug, Glug.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Let me see if I have this straight. Mayor Giuliani would like to get a divorce from his wife, so he can marry his girlfriend before he leaves office. President Clinton heard this and he said, 'You can do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So now, Trent Lott went from the Majority Leader to the Minority Leader, and Tom Daschle went from being Minority Leader to Majority Leader. It was all very easy, smooth transition. All they had to do was switch hairpieces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And George W. Bush is nervous. And so to ease tension with the Democrats, he's inviting them to dinner at the White House. And I'm thinking, 'Boy, I sure miss the Clinton White House, you know. Remember how he used to ease tension?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other night at the White House, President Bush had dinner with his archrival, John McCain. In fact, the staff at the White House said today they haven't seen that many dirty looks over dinner, well, since Bill and Hillary were eating together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other day in Tampa, Florida, President Bush helped build a Habitat for Humanity house for the homeless. Yeah. Although, Bush was a little confused. Yeah, yeah. He thought the house was for all the homeless.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems Jenna Bush -- you know, Jenna 'Anheuser' Bush -- you know who she is. Apparently, she's taking up a new musical instrument. She's learning how to play the breathalyzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the Middle East, Israel's Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, has called PLO Leader Yasser Arafat a murderer and a pathological liar. So at least the two sides are talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;An Israeli man's life was saved when he was given a Palestinian man's heart in a heart transplant operation. Isn't that something? The man's doing fine. The bad news? Guy can't stop throwing rocks at himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush -- a lot of people have been complaining for a while that he doesn't care about the environment. Now, have you noticed? He is now focusing on the environment. If you've been reading the newspapers, he's really getting into it. Once they explained what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Next week, President Bush is going to address an international summit on the problems of global warming. . The President says, 'Global warming is a serious problem. If we don't do something soon, my daughters won't be able to have frozen margaritas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Global warming is getting worse and global warming experts -- listen to how bad it's going to be: By the year 2010 -- this is what the global warming experts say -- the global warming will be so bad there will not be enough party ice for the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush officially signed into law his tax cut plan after he found a way to pay for the tax cut and save Social Security. His solution, you ask? Cashing in his daughter's empties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story, in what have you done with Bill Clinton news, President Bush made good on one of his campaign promises today. No, he didn't have a keg put into his desk, he signed a $1.3 billion tax relief bill. Oh, one more time. Theisman, that's a big break right there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carig Kilborn: &quot;The refund is intended to make taxes less of a burden on more Americans and give Al Gore more to spend on fancy shrinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Every American will receive at least $300, or as Bush's daughters refer to it, beer money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton was over in Europe where he attended the French Open. And he got upset when he realized it was a tennis tournament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, happy birthday. Today is former First Lady Barbara Bush's 76th birthday. Want to wish her a happy birthday. She celebrated the usual way -- doing Jell-o shots with her granddaughters.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More trouble for the Bush daughters today with alcohol. . Yeah, they ran out! Hey!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, a lot of people are saying the Bush twins have been getting way, way too much attention. And it doesn't deserve to be a page one story. It's on the cover of People magazine. You know, I think the Bush girls enjoy being celebrities. . Well, sure. 'Cause now, when they go into a bar, free drinks!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Governor Jeb Bush of Florida announced he is going to run for election. Listen to this -- not only did he announce he is running for reelection, he also announced what the final vote count will be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Of course, the big story this week -- you all know the Democrats took control of the US Senate because Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords switched from Republican to Independent. Big deal. That's what everyone's been talking about. And ironically -- this is strange -- Jeffords did this on the same week that Jenna Bush switched from Miller Lite to Heineken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Of course, the President's brother's in the news -- Jeb Bush. I love that -- Jeb. 'Jeb, get over here.' 'All right, Pa. 'I'm a comin', Pa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Jeb Bush has announced that he will run for reelection as governor of Florida even if his opponent is Janet Reno. She might run, yeah. Yeah, Bush says that if he runs against Reno, his campaign slogan will be 'Let the best man win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There's a magazine article that says that since the election, Al Gore and Bill Clinton have not spoken. This makes perfect sense to me. I mean, honest to God, what is Clinton going to say? 'Hey, nice going, Al. 'Atta boy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Clinton, what the hell? Clinton don't care anymore. Clinton, you know, he and his wife, our Senator, moved up to...they've got a place up there in Chappaqua, and two or three times a week they see Clinton in a bar there in Chappaqua. Honest to God. Last night he was in the bar in Chappaqua buying shots for the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Apparently Tony Blair has been voted to serve a second term while the Conservative Party has handled the news well, the cows are still really mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hearing about his victory, Vice President Dick Cheney thought about having heart palpitations and realized the news had nothing to do with him, and drank another milk shake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Let me get this straight. In England, you have to win the election to run the country. We should give that a whirl here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

So you had Clinton, Jesse Jackson and a bunch of NBA players all in the same building. Whew, you bet the women were handing out birth control there all night, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You see Clinton make that face? When Shaq missed a foul shot. Clinton makes this face. Oh, yeah, like his aim is any better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush has embarked on his first overseas trip since becoming President. And because he's visiting five different countries in six days, he's gonna have toasts, you know, for each world leader. Luckily, his daughters should be able to help him out there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the President is going to Europe to discuss global warming or, as he calls it, 'Summer!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scientists now say global warming is an undisputed fact and the earth is growing hotter each year, which is more bad news for President Bush because now his daughters are really gonna want a cold beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The White House is furious -- furious -- because People magazine put the Bush girls on the cover this week. Yeah. They feel it's an invasion of privacy. You know, of course, the Bush girls are even madder about being on the cover because now it's harder for them to use their fake IDs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Governor Jeb Bush has decided to run for governor of Florida once again. There was concern that his popularity dropped after the presidential election. And then he realized, 'Hey, wait a minute. My brother won without the popular vote. That's really overrated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, today, Katherine Harris declared him the winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today was Tim McVeigh's last day or, as they say in Hell, 'Incoming!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Los Angeles has put in a bid to host the 2012 summer Olympic games. And they say we have a good chance of getting it, too. Well, I hope so.  I mean, I'd sure hate to see the games go to some third-world country with no electricity, choking pollution and a shortage of police officers, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President George Bush.began a five-day European trip. He's in Europe. He's going to kick off the beginning of the dumb American tourist season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush wants things to go well while he's in Europe. He's hoping to introduce T-ball to France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Puerto Rican Day parade is a big day for Hillary Clinton. She took time off from pretending to be Jewish so she could pretend to be Puerto Rican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The report is coming out of Washington now.I don't know if this is true, but it's in the newspaper -- that Hillary wants her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to earn more money. Wants him to earn more money. I thought, 'Really?' So now listen to this. ... So today, in front of the house up in Chappaqua, Clinton sets up a pardon stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yeah, Hillary wants Bill to get a job and I'm thinking to myself, 'Well, is that smart? I mean, isn't that really what got him impeached in the first place?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Iran's elections may seem primitive, unsophisticated and inefficient -- I'm sorry. I was thinking about Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually Bush said today that being in Europe isn't that big of an adjustment for him. He said in a lot of these European countries they drink a lot and drive on the other side of the road, just like he used to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess he was in Belgium today. He was speaking and he said he had high hopes for the ceasefire in the Mideast between the Israelis the Palestinians. I'm not sure President Bush quite understands the Middle East. He said, this whole thing will work out if the Muslims and the Jews would just start acting like good Christians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsweek is reporting this week that President Bush was stunned -- stunned when he found out just how many nuclear weapons America has. Here's my question -- how can you tell when Bush is stunned? Doesn't he always look stunned?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;79-year-old Senator Jesse Helms -- Jesse Helms -- you remember Jesse. He went to his first rock concert last week. Jesse went to a U2 concert with Bono -- invited by Bono to go to a rock concert. And Helms said he liked U2, but he said, frankly, he preferred, you know, performers his own age, like the Rolling Stones.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And there's now talk on Capitol Hill of cutting the national beer tax in half. Cutting the beer tax in half. Yeah, how 'bout that? And today, Bush's daughters said, 'Dad rules! Yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton was here in Los Angeles over the weekend, played a round of golf with Jack Nicholson. That's kind of cool, isn't it? But it's an odd twosome, isn't it, Nicholson and Clinton? I mean, Nicholson, who dated Lara Flynn Boyle...and Clinton, who dated Monica Lewinsky. They're like Jack Sprat and his wife. One guy likes no fat, the other likes no lean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jesse Jackson's wife has been jailed, arrested in Puerto Rico for protesting. Remember Al Sharpton got arrested? ... She's down there protesting against the Naval bombing in the area. Jesse Jackson's wife was arrested. They said she could get 40 days in jail. And today, Jesse Jackson immediately scheduled daylong meetings with four of his secretaries to decide on a course of action. He said these meetings could run well into the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush, of course, back from his European trip and he said...this is interesting. Did you hear this quote? He said when he looked into the eyes of Vladimir Putin, he could see his soul. Now wasn't this an old Clinton pickup line?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I want to tell you, there is nobody with more soulful eyes than the former head of the KGB.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And that's funny, because when you got that close to Yeltsin, all you got a sense of there was, well, God, his breath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There is an alligator loose in Central Park. ... I'll give you the description, if you happen to be in Central Park. ... They say it has tough, thick hide...and cold, dead eyes. And they've named it Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush admitted today that he is a friend -- a friend of the electric industry. He said today, 'I owe them a lot.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And congratulations to Chelsea Clinton -- graduated from Stanford University this week. It's quite an accomplishment. Both her parents were there, in the same state, together. I don't think that's ever happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, there's one kind of embarrassing incident. You know, when Bill and Hillary saw all those people standing around in black robes, out of force of habit, they both stood up and said, 'Not guilty, your honor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Jesse Jackson's wife &quot;got arrested. Jesse's wife got arrested protesting down there (in Vieques). Police were tipped off by an anonymous caller who sounded an awful lot like Jesse Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There was an article today in USA Today about psychics.these psychics who claim they can talk to the dead?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A group of doctors are trying to ban TV ads like Bob Dole's Viagra commercial because they think the ads are unethical. That's what they said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Power company officials keep telling us, unless we give them more money, they will keep cutting off our electricity. See, here's what I don't understand. See, when the power company does it, it's called a rate hike. When the mob does it, it's called extortion. Why is that, huh, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know how many power company executives it takes to screw a lightbulb in in California? Doesn't take any. They're too busy screwing consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Our own Governor Gray Davis testified yesterday in the Senate about the energy crisis here in California. Of course, he was in Washington, DC. And as all Californians know, 'DC' stands for 'Don't Care!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Even President Bush told our Governor, 'You know, I've been operating in the dark for years. Now you can, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsweek magazine says this week that President Bush was stunned -- stunned -- when he learned how many nuclear weapons the US has. Of course, that's not saying much. I mean, Bush was also stunned when he learned how many raisins there were in a box of Kellogg's Raisin Bran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush has returned from his trip to Europe. And he's already written a book about it. It just came out today... It's called 'Are we there yet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's my favorite story. Senator Joe Lieberman now introducing a bill to hold Hollywood -- wants to hold Hollywood accountable for sex and violence. Washington holding Hollywood accountable. That's like Sodom checking up on Gomorrah, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush is in some big trouble. I don't know if you saw this, but the New York Times reported today that President Bush's approval rating is the worst it's ever been. The worst. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's a big night for astronomy buffs. You know what I'm talking about, a big night for astronomy buffs?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Gov. Gray Davis &quot;says that the power companies overcharge the state by $9 billion. $9 billion. You know how much money that is? You know, it takes the oil companies two months to overcharge that much.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest poll, 53% of Americans approve of the way George Bush is running the country. The other 47% said, 'You can't fool me. We know Bush isn't really running the country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;FBI Deputy Director Tom Pickard has been named acting director of the FBI until a permanent replacement can be chosen. This came as a complete surprise to everybody except, of course, the Russians, who knew two weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Good news for former President Clinton. It's time he had some good news, right? He's had a lot of problems. . It was reported today that former President Clinton could get -- he could get more money for his memoirs than his wife Hillary Clinton got for hers. Good news. Very good news.  That's right. Yeah, President Clinton's memoirs are tentatively titled, 'It Takes A Hot Tub.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former President Nixon's family announced yesterday that they're gonna rebury Nixon's dog Checkers next to former President Nixon. They're gonna dig him up and rebury him so that they can be together, yeah. It's kind of nice. That's right. Yeah, and, in a related story, President George W. Bush says that when he dies, he wants to be buried next to Scooby Doo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The city has hired an alligator hunter, and he's going to try to capture this cold-blooded beast and return it to its backwoods swamp. And if that works, they're going to do the same thing with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;With the crocodile safely captured, perhaps New York can concentrate on this dangerous weasel right here.&quot; (A clip of Sen. Hillary Clinton was shown)</SPAN></P>

In fact, did you see what Bush said about it today? He said, 'See, you can't rely on solar power. It's not dependable.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Bush now working on his plan to give religious groups Federal dollars. There's just some paperwork first -- you know, like, what to do with the Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest poll, 53% of Americans say they approve of the way George W. Bush is running the country. You know -- letting Dick Cheney run it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Bill Clinton now writing two books at once. This guy is nothing, if not smart. And both books very different. They just came out today. Here they are here. This is the first book. It's called 'Prosperity and Peace in the New Millennium.' It's all about policy -- very policy oriented. Second book is about his days in the White House. It's called 'I Like 'Em Fat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the new number one movie -- didn't I say this would be the number one movie? 'The Fast and the Furious,' the number one movie. 'The Fast and the Furious' -- isn't that what the White House staff used to call Bill and Hillary?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: NBC's &quot;Spy TV&quot; show &quot;features hidden cameras featuring unsuspecting citizens in surprising situations doing things they shouldn't. Boy, that's gotta be Congressman's Gary Condit's worst nightmare, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All right, you know this whole thing with Gary Condit there. And now there's flight attendants and everybody else coming out of the woodwork. But, anyway, Condit has hired a criminal attorney -- and it's not Johnnie Cochran, so he could be innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Bob Dole is &quot;in the hospital. He's undergoing an angioplasty, and I wanna wish Bob Dole the best. That's a scary combination. Bob Dole, a hospital gown and Viagra. You don't want to be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro was giving a speech and passed out. ... You know, he gives them long, long, like ten hour speeches, and he passed out. Apparently he was listening to it, and just boom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Seems police in Washington now are interviewing all h former interns to see if he had a pattern of seducing them. Oh, come on. Like a Democrat in a position of power would use that to try and have sex with younger (women) -- where do they dream up these scenarios?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the House passed a bill to protect rhinos and tigers from extinction. And as you know, President Bush, trying very hard to improve his image among environmentalists. Like he said today, in the next few years, he would like to reintroduce rhinos and tigers back into our national parks system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's being reported that former President Clinton signed a deal to write two books about his life. That's classic Clinton, isn't it? The only guy in the world who tells two different versions of his own life story. . You see, you have the initial book and then, of course, the retraction that comes out afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And as you know, Friday was take your dog to work day. Did you hear about this? I guess Clinton took his dog, Buddy, to work at his new office in Harlem. Kind of an embarrassing incident. You probably saw this in the paper. I guess, as dogs often do -- you know, he had his dog in the office. I guess the dog put its nose under Clinton's secretary's dress. And then Clinton and the dog bumped heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems a security guard at a Turkish bank robbed his own bank, the bank he was guarding. He robbed the bank of $25,000 and then tossed the money to bystanders out in the street. Isn't that something? Stole the money and then gave it away. Police don't know if he's dyslexic or just a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I was thinking about it today. John McCain and I, I believe, have a great deal in common. John McCain was a prisoner of war for a number of years. And I've been here at CBS for a number of years, so I think we...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now, instead of killing each other, rival mob families are suing each other. Did you know that? . In fact, the only crime family left here in New York is the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you been following this guy? Oh, Mr. Hypocrite? Well, this is a California congressman who has not been very forthcoming with the FBI about his involvement with this missing intern and now, it turns out, a lot of other women. Well, now, it was revealed that when Clinton was in trouble back in '98 with Monica Lewinsky, he wrote a letter to Newt Gingrich demanding -- demanded that Bill Clinton come forward with full disclosure and all the details. You know, that's like (pop singer) Little Kim telling you to put more clothes on, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Follow me here. Condit wrote the letter about Clinton to Newt Gingrich. Only in Washington would you have a man alleged to have had an affair with an intern condemn a man who had an affair with an intern by writing to a man who had an affair with his staffer. God bless Washington, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said today he's still working on his plan to give religious groups Federal dollars. He says there's no reason government and religion can't coexist. Hey, after all, it works so well in Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, is reporting that Long Island physicist Dr. John Marberger III, a very well-renowned physicist, has emerged as the leading candidate to be President Bush's science adviser.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bill Clinton gave the commencement speech at the Performing Arts School in New York. You know, that's the movie where the movie 'Fame' -- remember the movie 'Fame?' That's where it took place. Clinton gave the commencement address. And during his speech, Clinton said that when he was President, there were days when he felt like he was up on stage acting. Yeah. Especially those days when he was acting innocent, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former President Clinton -- he will not go away, he's like the thing from the swamp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former President Clinton spoke at a high school graduation here in New York, and he told the students -- this is what he said, I thought was strange -- he said he wishes he were 35 to 40 years younger. That's what he said in his speech, yeah. Yeah, not only that, President Clinton told the female students he wishes they were two to three years older.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush met with the Prime Minister of Israel. There was one awkward moment when President Bush asked, 'Wait a minute, if you're Jewish, how can you be a minister?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This George W. Bush...the latest poll, his popularity, approval rating, has dropped seven points . Finally, a glimmer of hope for the Al Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Former President Clinton &quot;said during one commencement address, he said that he wished he were a kid again. And I'm thinking, 'Well, hell, isn't that what nearly got him impeached?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Of course, he wishes he was a kid again. He wasn't married to Hillary then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former President Bill Clinton was on hand and stressed the importance of music to the youngsters. . Then he added if he hadn't been President, 'I wouldn't have gotten laid so much.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;For those of you who are curious, Clinton was in Newark, because Hillary wasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know this Congressman, Gary Condit, and the missing intern? Well, more and more details coming out about his love life. It seems a United Airlines flight attendant told the FBI she broke up with him after a year long love affair. A flight attendant -- she was having sex with him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Clinton gave the commencement speech at the Performing Arts School in New York. That's the school made famous by the movie 'Fame.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton also said he's writing two books at the same time. Two books! This guy's amazing. He's even two-timing his publisher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has just published a book on how to run your business called &quot;Rudy's Rules.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and it looks like Roger Clinton's moving to a gated community, Federal prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Gambino family paid Roger Clinton $50,000, and Roger's lawyer said, 'No, that had nothing to do with Roger Clinton trying to get one of the Gambinos a presidential pardon.' Of course not. Of course not. The mob loves to hand out checks for $50 grand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But it's good to see the Gambinos and the Clintons. They're like one crime family reaching out to help another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bob Dole, doing well after surgery to repair a bulge -- he had a bulge in a blood vessel. Apparently, what happened was a Viagra pill had a bad sense of direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Evangelist Pat Robertson, trying to build an oil refinery here in Southern California, but he says he's having a tough time trying to get approval. He says the big oil companies are trying to frustrate his efforts. Boy, he thought he had a tough time dealing with Satan, huh? Wait'll you deal with the oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's my question -- why is an Evangelist building an oil refinery? What is he starting to think? 'Hey, you know, this religion thing plays good, but, oh, I could make a lot of dough with $2.50 a gallon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, in Moorpark, California, which is right over here, 28, 000 people lost power for several hours after a hawk dropped a snake on some power lines. What, are we cursed now, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was a year ago today, that after a long, drawn-out process, Elian Gonzalez was returned to Cuba with his father. That was a year ago. . And they actually -- they talked to Elian. Elian says he's glad he's back in Cuba, but he does miss that nice man Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Speaking of Florida, it was reported today that Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris -- remember her? Katherine Harris is considering running for Congress. Yeah, yeah. When asked about it, Harris said, 'I know I can win -- especially if they let me count the votes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's so hot, former President Clinton undid his fly just for the ventilation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then he got into bed with Hillary just for the chills. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's times like this that I'm proud Hillary Clinton is our junior Senator from the great state of New York. She is trying to put together -- now follow me on this -- she is trying to put together a bill now that will outlaw cock fighting. Finally, a politician listening to the voters. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What a crowd. Woo, man! I tell you. Boy, you guys sound like Bill Clinton when he found out Julia Roberts was available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And 'Survivor 3' is about to begin. But enough about Dick Cheney. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;For the 600th time this year, Dick Cheney going into the hospital with an irregular heartbeat. And tomorrow, he's going to get something called a pacemaker plus. Sounds like some sort of Ron Popeil thing, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I mean, for Cheney going to the hospital -- this is like going to Jiffy Lube for him. You know? Every three months or 300 heart attacks, boom! You go in, you get the little checkup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said it's not too serious. But it is scary. It is scary when you stop and you think that George W. Bush is literally a heartbeat away from being President of the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today at the White House, President Bush hosted an event honoring black music month. . He even introduced Dick Cheney by his rap name, 'Busta Artery.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;James Brown was there to celebrate. Yeah. That's the first time somebody's been at the White House who speaks even worse English than Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like Microsoft has won its big lawsuit against the government. Microsoft will not be broken up. Bill Gates -- did you see how happy he was? Whoo, I haven't seen him that pleased since they invented the pocket protector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ah, he was just so excited. And you can see the effect of the ruling. Like today, I turned on my computer. Instead of saying 'You've got mail,' it said, 'Bill Gates is God. You will worship him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, big problems for Roger Clinton. Yeah, yeah, congressional investigators looking into the Clinton pardon scandal have linked Roger Clinton to a $50,000 check from the Gambino family. Yeah, yeah. Roger's mixed up with the Gambino -- now he's an embarrassment to two families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You don't want to mess with those guys. Roger Clinton better be careful starting his car in the morning. Oh, he doesn't have a car. That's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know the difference between Roger Clinton and the Gambino family? Roger Clinton's never had a hit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Florida's Secretary of State Katherine Harris -- remember her? The one who called the election. Remember Cruella DeVille? Remember that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like she's going to run for Congress. In fact, she's expected to make the announcement very soon. Not that she's running. You know, the announcement that she's already won!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Senate's still working to put together a patients' bill of rights. You know, while they're debating this patients' bill of rights, can we get it to include an amendment for maybe longer hospital gowns that actually close in the back?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, Jesse Jackson's wife out of jail. She's been freed after spending ten days in a Federal detention center in Puerto Rico. She said it's nice to have her freedom, which is the same thing Jesse said when she went to prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today Vice President Dick Cheney announced he's gonna undergo a routine procedure to have a pacemaker placed in his heart. Yeah, and apparently, he's gonna be fine, but they're gonna do that. Cheney said the only problem is that while he's having the procedure done, President Bush will be running the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody is barbecuing (for the Fourth of July). For example, down in Washington, DC, police will be grilling Gary Condit for the third time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Vice President Cheney held a press conference today to tell the public that he may have a high tech pacemaker implanted into his body. It will help him deal with a frail and failing organ, George W. Bush's brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Advisors later explained to Bush that although Cheney was having a mechanical device implanted into his chest, he would not become a scary monster.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here in New York City today, it was hot. Wasn't it just nasty, awful? Today I was sweating more than Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm telling you, it's been so hot on the east coast, Gary Condit is happy to be under that cloud of suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend, George W. Bush and his father George W. Bush played golf in Kennebunkport at the family vacation home. I'll tell you something, there's nothing more relaxing than 18 holes of golf at a restricted country club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now, this is getting serious. Dick Cheney, before he was vice president, had like eight heart attacks, and now, since he's been elected, he's had, I don't know, a handful of heart attacks. So over the weekend, they had this surgical procedure, and they put a pacemaker, they implanted a pacemaker in the guy. . But the pacemaker they put in for Dick Cheney, it's a brand-new cutting-edge medical development. It's called pacemaker plus. And not only -- if his heart stops -- will it restart his heart.when he's not at home, it also records all his favorite TV shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's interesting how times change, and as times change, things change, because you have different people at different times. For example, Cheney now has an implantable defibrillator to get his heart started.  And you know, just a couple years ago, Clinton, all he needed was an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Well the good news&quot; is that Rep. Gary Condit is &quot;now coopering with the authorities. Earlier today he allowed police to search his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Exciting day here in New York City, President George W. Bush is visiting New York City today. President George W. Bush.it is interesting, the first thing George W. wanted to do when he got to town, he says, 'I want to meet the guy who voted for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Down in Washington, it was hot today; they had to replace Dick Cheney's pacemaker with an ice maker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney, you know, last time they installed what is called a 'pacemaker plus.' And not only does this start his heart, whenever it stops...but it also grills burgers with less fat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They gave Cheney something called an 'implanted defibrillator' and it's used to jump start his heart. And of course, the old way they would have to roll him downhill and pop the clutch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'the most powerful guy in the world' news, President George Bush left the White House to go over an immigration ceremony at New York's Ellis Island. . Many of the new citizens said they were glad to live in a democracy where the guy who gets less votes wins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Meanwhile, in uptown in New York City, Al Gore waited in line with several immigrants, trying to sell oranges on the corner of Broadway and 125th Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And Dick Cheney, you know, he had that surgery. They implanted a pacemaker -- they call it the pacemaker plus -- you know, last weekend, and Monday he's back at work. That's a pretty good gig. And it's the pacemaker plus, whenever his heart stops, which apparently is every couple of days, the pacemaker plus will start his heart, not only that but it holds up to ten CDs. That's why they call it plus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you are following the Gary Condit saga? . Yesterday, Washington police searched his apartment, you know.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The cops searched this guy's apartment and they were wearing infrared glasses to detect blood stains. And I'm thinking, 'Geez, I thought that only happened at my House.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

Phenomenal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only does it start it heart, but if he's not at home, it records all his favorite TV shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Late last night a woman in Washington, DC, gave birth to septuplets. Isn't that nice. Septuplets. And they are fine. They are all healthy. Yeah, apparently everyone in Washington is talking about the septuplets. Even President Bush called and said, 'I wish both your babies well.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;An Arab newspaper, reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is thinking of stepping down in September. He might leave? He might step down. Yeah. Apparently that's what they are saying. Yeah, when asked about it, Saddam said, I want to spend more time with the family members I haven't executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The TV show 'Big Brother 2,' not doing well -- not doing well in the ratings. In fact, producers said today they're trying to get more action in the show. They're going to move it to Gary Condit's apartment in Washington.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This past week, police searched Gary Condit's apartment. Amazingly, they found O.J.'S other glove. What are the odds of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess you've heard Gary Condit has given another DNA sample, this time to a flight attendant from Southwest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is my favorite thing. Last week, Gary Condit's lawyer said Gary took his own lie detector test and passed it with flying colors. What are the odds of that? Today he announced Gary gave himself his own trial and, oh, he was found completely innocent! What's next, his own tax audit? Look, a refund!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Condit finally admitted during his third interview with police -- his third interview -- that, yes, he did have an affair with the intern Chandra Levy. Well, that's a typical congressman. You've got to ask him the same question three times before he gives a straight answer. This guy makes Clinton look like a good liar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, we joke about this. But you interns that are going to Washington, young men and women, remember, if you have sex with a congressman, you're not just having sex with a congressman. You're also having sex with everyone Congress has screwed in the past eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Don't you love how outraged all the other politicians in Washington are? Like on 'Face the Nation' yesterday, Republican Senator Trent Lott called on Condit to resign. He said, 'In Washington, infidelity is unacceptable, especially when it's with an intern on your staff.' And after the show, Lott returned to the cave he's been living in for the last ten years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Washington this past weekend, someone walked into a congressional hearing room, stole a laptop computer. The guy was stealing from politicians. Today, police charged him with irony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you familiar with the PBS show 'The Antiques Road Show'? They are doing the show in New York this week and the Clintons were in line with all of their stolen White House furniture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You folks been following the Gary Condit situation? It turns out the guy, when he would take one of his dates out to dinner, he would wear like sunglasses and different hats. And the date would not be allowed to being along I.D. It's like I have a twin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The only way you can look at this Gary Condit deal is at least it's taken the heat off Robert Blake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former Vice President Dan Quayle donated over 400 boxes of valuable private papers to the Dan Quayle museum. The museum has divided the papers into two rooms: 'Mens' and 'Womens.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is day two of our new set. We're working all the bugs out with the new set. You know, we got rid of all the old stuff. All the old stuff -- we got new chairs, got a new couch, we got a new desk. Same thing Gary Condit did to his apartment before the cops showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Trent Lott -- what is he, Senate Minority Leader, was calling for Gary Condit to resign. But Condit said he is not ready to resign. He says he still has a lot of unfinished women to do.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, not only is Condit not going to resign, his people say he may run for reelection. In fact, he's got a terrific campaign slogan -- 'I love my fly, and it shows.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Condit's still not talking to the press, but this afternoon, he said he would be willing to go on the TV show 'Blind Date.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember the other day when Gary Condit's lawyers claimed the guy kind of passed his own private lie detector test? Turns out it was not a lie detector, he was hooked up to the cappuccino machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I love all the self-righteous people in this thing. And the flight attendant, Anne Marie Smith -- remember, she's the woman who claimed she had the affair with Gary Condit. She says Condit tried to force her to sign an affidavit saying she's never had an affair, but she refused to sign it based on principle. What principle is that? 'I'm an adulterer, not a liar, ladies and gentlemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's gotta be strange. Really. I mean, cheating on your wife with a flight attendant? What is that like? I mean, they're in bed and she's going, 'Should your wife come home, in the event she comes home early, please notice the location of the emergency exit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The great thing about congressmen -- they stick together. They protect their own. Did you see Gary Condit going into that Agricultural Committee meeting today? Take a look at this. Watch how he's greeted by his friends. . Look at this guy sittin' next to him. Look at that -- turns away. Look at that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Congress is like a group of animals -- you know, when one of them is injured and all the other animals come over and try to eat it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Times reporting today that the head of Saudi Arabia -- Prince Abdullah, I believe his name is -- recently talked to George W. Bush's father -- you know, former President Bush -- in order to be reassured about his son's foreign policy. Well, that's comforting, isn't it? Huh? When heads of state call the White House and they talk to President Bush, they go, 'Hi. Yeah, is your daddy there?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dick Cheney suffering from laryngitis this week, so his wife Lynne had to read the Vice President's speech on energy in Pittsburgh yesterday. His wife read the speech 'cause he had laryngitis. Now, laryngitis itself isn't all that dangerous, except when you're trying to scream 'I'm having a heart attack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here is your tax dollars at work. Listen to this. We're supposed to be conserving energy, right? Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing now? The Navy is now being asked to pay the electricity bill of Vice President Dick Cheney's house in Washington, 'cause it's the Naval Observatory. They're asking us, the taxpayers, to pay his electric bill. You know how much it is? $186,000 a year. How many times are they shockin' him back to life?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's two people that live in the house! $186,000 -- what, are he and Bush electrocuting guys in the basement now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Speaking of electricity, the slime ball Pacific Gas and Electric Company -- you know, they just filed for bankruptcy. They filed for bankruptcy. These were the people that have screwed us. . They're giving their top executives $17.5 million bonuses. They're giving out bonuses 'cause otherwise, they might leave and go to another company. Ooh, yeah. Ah, you'd hate to lose these guys after a great job they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Beijing, China, has been chosen to host the 2008 Olympic games. The Chinese have a new track and field event -- just invented it -- called 'outrun a tank.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the opening ceremony -- this is pretty good. This is pretty good, what the Chinese have done. They have thousands of kids that are gonna demonstrate how to make sneakers for two cents an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The word is, China got the Olympics under the theory that giving a country the international spotlight will help them correct their human rights abuses. You know, I mean, it worked so well for Hitler in '36, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney came down with laryngitis, so his wife.had to deliver a speech for him. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, and afterwards, Cheney's wife had to spend the rest of the day telling President Bush what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the Gary Condit saga? This guy's a piece of work ain't he? So what he does is -- he gives himself over the weekend -- he gives himself a lie detector test. And then he announces that he was telling the truth. Today, he put himself on trial and found himself not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There's a thing in the New York Times. They did this investigation. They're checking George W. Bush and the overseas ballots. Have you read about this thing? It turns out, like about 80% of the overseas ballots were illegal. The George W. Bush ballots from overseas. Well, finally, at last, a spark of hope for the Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Dick Cheney &quot;gets his electric bill: $186,0000. . I'm telling you, he should have gotten the solar powered pacemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You'd have a big electric bill too, if you had to use those electric paddles eight times a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: Cheney &quot;can't talk: He got laryngitis. And of course, that's from yelling all day, 'Quick, my heart pills! Quick!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former Vice President Dan Quayle delivered over 400 boxes of his personal papers to the Dan Quayle Museum in Alabama yesterday. . His official papers are historic for reasons known only to Quayle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Popular exhibits at the Dan Quayle Museum include the exit, emergency exit and any open window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The museum is in place so that 50 years from now, kids can ask what did this porn shop use to be?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, it's Wednesday, or as Gary Condit calls, it hump day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This Gary Condit, certainly in the media eye these days, isn't he? You can't turn on the TV without seeing this guy. In fact, today, he got a phone call from Lesley Stahl. And she asked him, can you do '60 Minutes?' He said, 'I'm good for about half an hour.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, more problems for Condit. It turns out today that Condit's brother is a fugitive in Florida. This is unbelievable. I guess his brother violated his parole, and police say they can't find him. And today, Gary Condit said he'd like to find out where his brother is hiding and join him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last week, Condit's attorney announced that Gary had taken his own lie detector test and passed it. Remember that? That was the big story. I don't know how difficult his lie detector test was. Turns out today they revealed it was multiple choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republican Senator Trent Lott said Gary Condit.should step down. Gary Condit should step down from his office if Condit did have an improper relationship with an intern. And today, Clinton said, 'Step down? Hell, the guy should run for president, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to this week's Newsweek, even though Gary Condit's given police many details about the last morning he and Chandra levy were together, he told police he can't remember if they had sex. Shut up! What 53- year-old man sleeps with a 24-year-old and can't remember if they had sex? Hey, most 53-year-old guys I know can remember the 24-year- old they saw in the fast lane going the other direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To give Condit credit, he is cooperating with police. Like today, instead of getting rid of any possible evidence, he handed it over to the FBI. He's just gonna let them misplace it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's the new story. The FBI has admitted they have misplaced 449 guns and 184 laptop computers. In fact, that's why FBI agents are called G-Men. They keep going, 'Gee, where's my gun? Gee, where's the computer that was here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Congress said today the FBI has lost the confidence of the American people. Now the FBI knows how Congress feels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Meanwhile, President Bush on his way to England. In fact, to prepare for the trip, he's trying to learn a few words of the language, so that'll work out good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And tomorrow, President Bush is gonna meet with the Queen of England for the very first time, according to experts. I think they'll hit it off, don't you? I mean, the Queen never won a popular vote. She inherited the job from her father, and she has lots of embarrassing relatives. The two will hit it off like two peas in a pod.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard, also, Dick Cheney has laryngitis. Came as a shock. He's normally so healthy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That puts us in great shape, doesn't it? You got a Vice President who can't say what's on his mind and a President who has nothing on his mind to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The 2008 Olympic games will be held in Beijing, China. The US still trying to wrap up some of the minor details. Like, if we land our planes there, can we leave when the Olympics are over?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush and several world leaders are heading to a conference in Italy, and as a precaution, true story, the Italian police have rounded up several anarchists. That really happened. Yeah, and after hearing about it, President Bush told the police, 'Good work. Now you should send those anarchists back home to Antarctica.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that about a week ago, Hillary Clinton officiated at the wedding of one of her longtime political aides. . There was one awkward moment, though. Right at the point where they ask if anybody has a reason to object, Hillary got out her wedding album.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you have been following this Gary Condit saga? Yeah, you got to admire how this guy operates. He is a one-man Supreme Court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last weekend, he gave himself a lie detector test. Guess what? He passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today, today, he cross-examined himself. And then tomorrow, I don't think he's going to be able to pick himself out of a lineup. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I like how Gary Condit, he's got those two-tone dress shirts, you know? Where the collar and the rest of the shirt are different colors? He looks like a closer at a Lexus dealership, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I don't understand this -- George W. Bush is in Europe again. Wasn't he just in Europe? This is his second 'I'm in over my head' tour, that's what this is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I guess it's like the G-8 conference or something, is that what it is? So he gets over there and said, 'Mr. President, can you name the G-8?' And he said, 'Sure, you got Superman, you got Batman, you got Aquaman, you got Spiderman, you got the Green Lantern, you got Wonder Woman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, President Bush left for his trip to Europe yesterday, although his flight was delayed two hours. Apparently what happened, one of the flight attendants overslept at Gary Condit's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush now in England. Today, he met with the Queen. Kind of embarrassed. He kept calling her Latifah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After England, President Bush going to Italy to meet the pope. The Pope said he's interested in meeting a US President who actually believes in all ten of the Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Gary Condit spent the whole day attending an agricultural meeting. Boy, that's when you know a congressman's in real trouble, when he spends the whole day actually working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Condit said today he hopes all the finger-pointing and insinuations about his character doesn't hurt his dating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Many of Gary Condit's fellow politicians are asking him to step down. Remember when Clinton first got caught, everybody thought Clinton would step down? Step down? Clinton didn't even slow down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you been reading about this Condit family? Fascinating group. This is unbelievable. I guess he's got a brother Daryl -- Daryl Condit who's an escaped convict. Then he's got a brother, Burell who was a cop who's been demoted and once shot himself in the ass. One's a convict, one shot himself in the ass, and who is the embarrassment to the family? The congressman!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, the FBI opened a new division at their headquarters, a lost and found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Something like 184 laptop computers and 450 guns are missing from the FBI headquarters. Well, nice to see those security guards from Los Alamos working again, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other big controversy in Washington now is over Vice President Dick Cheney's wanting the Navy to pay his $186,000 electric bill. Hey, they're gettin' off easy. They're lucky they don't have to pay his ambulance bill. That's the big one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republicans want to know why the Navy won't pay for it, Democrats want to know why Cheney won't pay for it, and Californians want to know why his electric bill is so low. $186,000? That's nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And as you know, right now, Vice President Cheney still suffering from a bad case of laryngitis. But President Bush is still talking, so it must be a trick, you know? You know, like the ventriloquist dummy, where the dummy drinks the water and he's still talking?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You ever watch Headline News? You ever see that anchorwoman Lynne Russell, very attractive woman? She announced she's gonna pose nude in Playboy. Well, if that doesn't get her an exclusive interview with Gary Condit, nothing will, believe me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Post Office says it will pay its executives millions of dollars in bonuses despite the fact that it has a $2 billion deficit. That's what they said. Yeah, unfortunately, the executives will never have a chance to cash their bonuses because they're being delivered through the US Mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Bush is in London today. That's right. And just as his car pulled into Buckingham Palace, a naked man, wearing only tennis shoes, ran towards him. True story. That's right, yeah. And in a related story, it turns out, Prince Charles' family jewels are as big as his ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Well, it turns out that Gary&quot; Condit &quot;has a brother, Darrell Wayne Condit, who happens to be a fugitive from justice. The guy's been in and out of jail five times for armed robbery and car theft. You understand what I'm saying, yeah? Even this guy is distancing himself from the congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is my favorite legal strategy in a long, long time. Everybody's on this guy, you know? 'Come on, you got to come clean. You're not talking to the cops. You're lying to the cops. What's the deal?' And he says, 'All right, I'll give myself a lie detector test.' Well, it turns out he passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But he's not done. Turns out today he tried to beat a confession out of himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Bush, of course, is in Europe right now for the Group of Eight summit. Group of Eight summit. Group of Eight. I believe President Clinton's record was group of three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story in 'two figureheads news,' George W. Bush arrived in England yesterday and met the Queen for the first time. Keep it in the family, guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In an awkward moment, Bush bragged that his hometown had a 'Dairy Queen,' a 'Burger King,' and a 'White Castle.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;He looked forward to seeing the English channel, because you can't get it here on American TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The President's brief statement to reporters was awkward, however, because Bush insisted that they use a translator in the foreign country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, scientists at the astrophysics institute have identified the smallest particle known to man -- Gary Condit's political future, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess police in Washington are investigating reports that Gary Condit was spotted late one night near a dumpster, tossing out gifts other mistresses had given him. That's not a good sign. When you have so many mistresses you need a dumpster to get rid of the stuff.ooh, that's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah. Actually, according to a new poll taken in his home district, most of his constituents say they don't want him to resign. Well, of course. If he resigns, he might come back and live in their neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Condit's brother Daryl, Daryl Condit -- Daryl Wayne Condit. They always have three names if you commit a crime. I guess this guy's been in and out of jail, like, five times in five different states. He's been on the lam for, like, six years now. This is true. His brother, he's a criminal. He's a heroin addict, an armed robber, a car thief. And the way things are going, he could wind up being the good brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He's very conservative, Gary Condit. He's a conservative Democrat. Like, he voted to display the Ten Commandments in schools, yet he himself broke the 11th Commandment -- thou shalt not put thy rod in thy staff. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, President Bush is in England this week. He and his Queen hit it off pretty good. At one point, the Queen said to Bush, 'How much do you know about the UK?' And he said, 'Well, I can spell it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is now in Genoa, Italy. And when he arrived there this morning, protesters threw bottles and cans. Yeah. In fact, Bush was surrounded by so many empties, ah, he was homesick for the girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess nationalists in Bombay, India, were protesting President Bush after it was found out that bush named one of his cats India. The protesters claim they found naming his pet after their country derogatory. And, of course, Bush, always the gentleman, immediately apologized. He said, 'Look, I had no idea India was a country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And next Monday Bush is gonna meet with the Pope. . Bush plans to tell the Pope that he believes in miracles. I think he does. Hey, he graduated from Yale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A report by the General Accounting Office shows it's gonna cost us taxpayers $1 million a year to support former President Bill Clinton. $1 million a year. And that's just for penicillin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton showed up at Bill's new office today. Gave him a kiss. Yeah, they showed it on the news. Gave him a kiss. Well, you can see why she's happy. Thanks to the Condits, they no longer have the most dysfunctional marriage in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Reverend Al Sharpton had filed a $1 million lawsuit because he was strip-searched by government agents when he was arrested for protesting in Puerto Rico. And today, government agents filed a $2 million lawsuit 'cause they were forced to strip-search Al Sharpton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;According to reports, Al Gore is slowly easing back into public life. He should've tried that during the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, we found out&quot; Gary Condit has &quot;a brother who's a fugitive from justice, Darryl Wayne Condit. Oh, no, wait a minute, he's no longer a fugitive, because Gary gave his brother a lie detector test and found him innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody is saying that Condit knows more than he's saying, you know. Well, you know the good thing with George W. Bush, you never have to worry about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier today,&quot; George W. Bush &quot;had lunch with Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth. And I was thinking, the two of them have a great deal in common. They're both conservative, both heads of state, and neither one of them have ever actually won an election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: The G-8 meeting &quot;took longer than expected because every time someone used the term G-8, Bush would yell out bingo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush is scheduled to meet with the Pope tomorrow in Rome where the two men will discuss the possibilities of oil exploration in heaven. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Big weekend for politics. Trent Lott was on Face the Nation.  Tom Daschle was on Meet the Press. Gary Condit was on Sex and the City. A lot of politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsweek magazine's reporting now that the reason a lot of congressmen are not speaking out about Gary Condit is that as many as 87 congressmen are currently cheating on their wives. Isn't that unbelievable? Newsweek wants us to believe that there are 348 congressmen that are faithful? Shut up. Come on.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Republican Congressman John Lebutieri.has publicly announced he thinks Gary Condit is bisexual. Well, here's my question. How does he know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Finally, someone in Washington works with people on both sides of the aisle. I say go for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of Gary Condit's closest friends said in an interview over the weekend that Condit believes in God and knows he has to answer to God. And today, Condit said he's already forgiven himself for everything he's done.  God does not need to get involved. He's taken care of the whole thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, Gary Condit's fugitive brother, Daryl Wayne Condit -- you see this guy? He gives white trash a bad name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He was arrested and flogged. So that's one Condit down, one to go, basically what that is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the tabloids -- there was a woman in the tabloids, another woman that had sex with Gary Condit. And she claimed that Gary Condit's favorite place to have sex was sitting on his Harley. You know, he owns a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Now, please, don't confuse that with President Clinton, who also liked riding a hog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator Hillary Clinton had an embarrassing slip of the tongue the other day. Did you see this? She was on the news. And after saying she had no intention of running for President, she was continuing her talk, and she went on to say, 'I'm having a great time being pres -- I mean Senator from New York.' Then later, when asked about her husband, Bill Clinton, she said, 'You know, I've been married to that son of a -- I mean that wonderful man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Right now, President Bush, currently in Italy at the G-8 summit, you know, the eight world leaders. And today, the seven other world leaders told Bush, 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush said today that being in Rome made him realize that so many words used in America come from Italy. Then he gave his examples.  He said, 'Like the word 'veto.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier today, President Bush met with Pope John Paul II. And Bush said to the Pope, 'The Second? So you got your job because of your dad, too? I can't believe that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Then the Bush daughters asked their dad if he could ask the Pope to ask how Jesus did that water-into-wine trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You've been following the Gary Condit saga? Well, you know one of the nice things about Gary, he has a fugitive brother. Darrell Wayne Condit. Over the weekend, he was picked up at a Red Carpet Inn, and if you've ever stayed at a Red Carpet Inn, you know not much gets picked up there, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Gary Condit is a piece of work, isn't he? He's a little oily, this guy. I'm telling you, he's one of those guys, when you see him on camera, you can smell his cologne through the TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's what we know about Gary Condit. Apparently he's a womanizer and he has a crooked brother. This guy could be president, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today, Monica Lewinsky is 28 years old. Celebrity birthday. 28 years old. It just seems like yesterday she was crawling around the floor of the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We had 'N Sync on the show last night. It was unbelievable. 400 screaming girls. It was like we were baitin' a trap for Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It turns out Gary Condit is a conservative Democrat -- interesting, this man. He's very conservative. Like, they asked him today, 'When does life begin?' And he said, 'Uh, when your wife's out of town.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, today, another woman has come forward, admitting to having an affair with Gary Condit. She is a T-shirt artist. . She told the papers that Condit did not like to wear condoms, was very cheap, did not engage in foreplay and had no concern for her pleasure. So at least he's a typical guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The reason a lot of congressmen won't speak out against Gary Condit is that as many as 87 congressmen are currently cheating on their wives. And, of course, they're all driven to adultery by all the sex that they see and hear on television. It's Hollywood's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsweek is also reporting that Gary Condit was meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney the day the missing intern, Chandra Levy, disappeared. Boy, talk about bad luck, huh? Condit's only alibi -- a guy with laryngitis who's got a bad heart. Ah, what are the breaks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Police say they want to interview Condit for a fourth time, but they insist he is not a suspect! Oh, apparently, he's just a really great storyteller. They enjoy his company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Condit has not been very cooperative. Like today, DC police finally got their hands on Condit's fingerprints, and they had to take 'em off the rear end of a Hooters waitress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush, currently in Europe. Yesterday, he was in Italy. And reporters asked President Bush how his meeting with the Pontiff went, and Bush said, 'Well, the Pontiff wasn't there, just the Pope.' He hopes to meet the Pontiff at some point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's an interesting poll on the Bush tax rebate. 30% of Americans say they're gonna spend the money immediately, and 70% of Americans say they're cautious. They're gonna save the money for the day that the Democrats get back in power and take it all away again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In an interview yesterday -- this is a little controversial.  Former President Jimmy Carter was extremely critical of President Bush. Very critical of President Bush. That's right, Carter's exact quote was, 'This guy is the worst President since me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the latest poll in northern California, 60% of voters -- 60% - - say they will not vote for Congressman Gary Condit in the next election. 60%. That's right. Apparently the other 40% are dating Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's so hot, down in Washington, DC, today, the only breeze was from the Washington DC cops blowing the Condit investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was so hot today, Gary Condit was carrying his jacket and his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you folks been following the Condit saga...the Gary Condit saga? Well, you know that in addition to being a womanizer, he has an outlaw brother. This guy could be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's exciting news. President Clinton's moving into his new office in Harlem. . Clinton is very excited. He has not had office sex in about seven months, so he's ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Even Clinton is feeling the heat today. It was so hot, he had a slurpee, and then he went to the 7-Eleven.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, welcome to NBC, which, of course, stands for 'Nobody Believes Condit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Washington police say they want to have a fourth -- a fourth interview with Gary Condit. You know, this is the most times Gary Condit's ever met with anyone he wasn't having sex with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, he's been down there so many times, he's actually getting a tan from the interrogation light now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newsweek magazine this week claims there are 87 congressmen currently cheating on their wives. No wonder it's so hard to get a hotel room in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't that something, 87 congressmen cheating on their wives? See, I hope this doesn't hurt Congress' image. I mean, you hate to see 87 bad apples ruin the whole barrel. You know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Jimmy Carter lashed out at President Bush. You know, this doesn't happen usually. Usually, former presidents kinda keep to themselves with these things, but he attacked Bush. He said he's been disappointed in just about everything Bush has done so far as President. And today, Bush fired back. He said, 'Hey, if this Jimmy Carter guy is so smart, how come I never heard of him?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The media is reporting that the Pope was genuinely happy to meet with President Bush on Monday. I think he likes him. Well, sure, you know. The Vatican is still patching the holes from the lightning bolts after Clinton's visit. Remember that thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, President Bush visited Kosovo. He said he couldn't believe how big it was. He said he remembers Kosovo when it was just known as 'the Price Club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, how many have gotten their tax refund check? . First of all, why do they even call this a refund? It's my money. It's not a refund. It's a reunion! Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm being reunited with my own money. . If a guy robs me and I get it back -- 'Hey, here's your refund.' It's not a refund!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Jimmy Carter said that he has been -- this is a quote - 'disappointed in almost everything President Bush has done as President.' That's what he said. Yeah, and after hearing this, President Bush said, 'Who the hell is Jimmy Carter?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday in Washington, former President Clinton dropped by his wife Hillary's office for the very first time. That's right. Yeah, and when asked about it, President Clinton said, 'I wanted to walk in on her unexpectedly and see how she likes it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Good news for tourists and folks from out of town. If you're interested in this kind of thing, the hookers in Times Square...God bless them, will accept your tax rebate checks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This morning I get in my cab and they have those celebrity recorded voices telling you stuff when you get in the cab. This morning, I get in the cab and the celebrity voice was Gary Condit...reminding me not to leave any evidence behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You remember the Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris? She has announced she's running for Congress, yeah. That's right. Exactly, just what we need, another crooked Florida election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;She already believes that the confused and disoriented voters will put her over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;She's very confident. She predicts that she will win the election by 742 votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'll give you an idea how hazy it was today. The visibility was so bad, President Clinton accidentally picked up his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The quality of the air is so bad, that today, for the first time ever, President Clinton had a burning sensation -- in his eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, search teams in Washington continued their search for any sight of integrity in Gary Condit. Yeah, still looking. They're looking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, I believe Gary Condit when he says he's innocent -- the same way I believe the DC police when they say he's not a suspect.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Police and the FBI say they both want to talk to Condit again. You know, they think they may get something new this time, like the truth, possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, this is the fourth interview -- the fourth interview with the guy. You know, these guys have spent more time with Condit than his wife has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the other day, Gary Condit's wife, Carolyn 'Rodham' Condit, flew to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;She flew to be with her husband, and he agreed to have sex with her as long as she promised not to tell anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know why she went back to Washington. I think we can rule out a second honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Condit said this afternoon he is willing to work with the FBI. In fact, he said today he bugged his own phone, came up with nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a reason lie detectors are inadmissible. Because a lie detector can often read a guilty answer as technically innocent. That's why you can't use them in court. For example, if Condit was hooked up to a lie detector and he told his wife, 'Honey, you're one in a million,' see, technically, that would be true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Condit's got a pretty good alibi. It seems the day of the disappearance, Condit was meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney. I'm not sure why he was meeting with Cheney. Maybe he just likes to hear heavy breathing no matter who's doing it, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest issue of Newsweek magazine claims that 87 congressmen in Washington are currently cheating on their wives. Yeah, well, here's the sad part. Every night, it's a different 87.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To be fair, not all members of Congress are cheating on their wives. You know, some are cheating on their husbands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, President Bush said he would not sign the Democrats' version of the patients' bill of rights because, he said, that would allow unlimited lawsuits against insurance companies or, as they would call that in other countries, democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess when President Bush first met the Pope, Bush said to him, 'You know, I love the pocket fisherman. I love the salad shooter.' And then the Pope said, 'No, no, that's Ron Popeil, you see.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, the Pentagon said today they want to close over 25% of all our military bases to save money. In fact, the Marines are changing their slogan from 'We're looking for a few good men' to 'We're not looking for anybody right now. We'll give you a call.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The New York Post claims that Senator Hillary Clinton has voted against more of President Bush's nominees than any other senator. She's really going after him. . When asked why, Hillary said -- and this is a quote, 'It's hard to get out of the habit of fighting with the President.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the Gary Condit saga? . The FBI has stepped in and they're going to take over because they felt that the Washington, DC, police were not bungling it fast enough, so the FBI said, 'We're going to bungle it in no time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I understand&quot; Condit is &quot;getting ready to sit down with Caribbean psychic Cleo, Miss Cleo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New 'Planet of the Apes' movie opened tonight. . Oh, and they're saying it is not a remake. It is not a sequel. It is a retelling. It's a totally different story using the original characters and the original setting. You know, kinda like what Gary Condit told the cops last night. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tabloids are now claiming the police focus may be on Mrs. Condit, his wife. And the problem is her alibi, pretty weak. Yeah. She claims that she was with Gary that night. Who's gonna believe that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now a former staff member who had a three year affair with Gary Condit told USA Today that Gary Condit gave her rules to follow, which included loyalty and secrecy. He demanded loyalty. Because if there's one thing an adulterer hates, it's disloyalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't you get a creepy feeling looking at that Condit guy? He's always walkin' around, he's got that smile. Got the jacket on. That's when you know you got a lot of mischief, you know? When you're the focus on a criminal investigation, your political career is ruined, but you can't wipe the smile off your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least Bill Clinton had the decency to pretend to pout, you know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Republican mayor of Waterbury, Connecticut, has been charged with soliciting sex from a minor. He's a Republican, and Gary Condit's a Democrat, thus maintaining the delicate balance of perverts in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One congressman said today he wants to draft a rule that would make it unethical for a congressman to have a sexual relationship with an intern. You know, only Congress needs a rule to tell them cheating on their wife is not ethical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British ambassador to the US presented President Bush with a bust of Winston Churchill. And I guess the presentation went smoothly until the ambassador unveiled the statue.and Bush said, 'That's not his bust, that's his head, isn't it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, our musical guest is Weezer. Here's something I bet you didn't know. You know, 'Weezer' is also Dick Cheney's Secret Service code name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, they started hearings on all the violence and sex in Hollywood, 'cause this is where the problem is, ladies and gentlemen. This is where it is. One congressman said, he says, 'We need a labeling system for movies and TV,' like we have for food. You know, like listing each ingredient so people know exactly what they're eating. Yeah, that worked so well with Twinkies, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long-awaited remake of 'Planet of the Apes' opens nationwide today, and it's been reported that Charlton Heston is featured in a cameo role. That's kind of cool. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Yeah, and in this version, Heston starts an all out war with the apes because they support trigger locks on guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll give you an idea how hot it was the other day. It was so hot that to cool off, President Clinton actually got in bed with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton, now, is our neighbor. You know, he's moved back into the city. He got brand-new offices and they're up on the upper East Side. Way, way up there, conveniently located, I think, between Wendy's and a Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is cute. When he...moved into his office, the first thing he did was he hung up his certificate of impeachment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, no move ever goes smoothly. There was some trouble today. His brand-new desk arrived. Clinton's brand-new desk arrived. He had to send it back. Apparently, not enough head room.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Gary Condit met with the Washington police for the fourth time last week. And police were a little upset at him. Apparently it was his turn to bring the doughnuts and he forgot this time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the DC police have turned the investigation now over to the FBI. Apparently the DC police weren't losing evidence fast enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit was questioned for more than two hours -- more than two hours. In fact, I was thinking about that -- this is the longest he's ever gone without committing adultery. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite story of the week. According to Newsweek, 87 congressmen are currently cheating on their wives. We should find out their names, maybe have them on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These guys want to clean up Hollywood. Let's see if we can help clean up the whole country a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;87 of them cheating on their wives. In fact, that's why they have roll call every morning, to see who's back from the motel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I know these guys like to poll their constituents, but this is ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton moved into his new office in Harlem today. And he said his whole life, he always loved Harlem and its breathtaking view of Manhattan. . In fact, he said from his office, he can see the building in Manhattan that he really wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His new neighbors threw a big block party for him to welcome him to the neighborhood. Did you see Clinton on the news? They showed him there. One white guy, all black guys. Looked like an NBA team, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Clinton made his first phone call from his Harlem office. He called Patrick Ewing - 'Hey, where are the good strip clubs around here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;San Bernardino police investigating Tyson's alleged involvement in a sexual assault. This is significant because if Tyson is involved in just one more sexual misconduct case, he'll be eligible to run for Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Colin Powell, calling his trip to China a huge success. So in other words, they let his plane leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, my mom, God bless her, back there in Indiana, she got her $300 tax rebate, you know? She's all excited about it. I get a call today. She spent it all calling Miss Cleo, that Caribbean psychic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this just in: Gary Condit has officially now gotten away with it. It's official.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're finding out more and more and more information about this guy. Here's the one that I love. He would call beauty salons in the Washington, DC, area and make appointments using the name 'Greg.' He would call the salon and make the appointment for 'Greg.' And then he would go in wearing a hat and some kind of a coat and dark glasses, and he would have his hair streaked. . You know, when I read this, ladies and gentlemen, I said to myself, 'It's like have a twin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton moved into his brand new offices up in Harlem, and...yeah, he's back in New York City. Clinton moved right in and said he feels right at home. Well, of course. His office is full of all that stolen White House furniture, so what, why wouldn't the guy feel right at home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton.he unpacked his laptop and then he unpacked his computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you know about this big scare in Washington, this Code Red virus? You heard about this thing? This has got everybody frightened half to death. This Code Red virus is sweeping computers all across the nation. They said tonight on the news, they fear this could actually cause the government to slow down. Is that possible?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the only government agency that safe from the virus is the FBI. All of their computers are immune, because as you know, all of their lap tops were stolen a few weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're movin' on up, President Clinton moved to Harlem!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's one way to make sure he doesn't run into any Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact when President Bush heard that Clinton was near the Apollo, he called Clinton and commended him on remaining active in the space program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton is a great showman. You see him in Harlem? He had children singing, and mayors and people -- and he tells the residents, 'I'm home.' He told them, 'I feel like I'm home in Harlem.' Feels like he's home, people cheering? When was the last time Hillary cheered when Clinton came home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, if they wanted Clinton to feel like he was home, they should have thrown.his clothes out on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy is amazing. Clinton's getting $8 million for his memoir. Hillary got $8 million for her memoirs. That's $16 million for two people who for eight years couldn't remember anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr. William Kennedy-Smith -- remember him? The Kennedy nephew who was acquitted of sexual assault charges a couple of years ago? . He now wants to run for Congress. That's kind of backwards, isn't it? I mean, first you get elected, then you have the sex scandal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this William Kennedy-Smith, he is a doctor now. And when you think about it, doctors and congressmen have a lot in common. Both take an oath. Both make good money. Both tell people, 'Hey, take your clothes off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that the Democrats' best choice, William Kennedy-Smith? Apparently, Mike Tyson was unavailable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on with Gary 'Ooh' Condit. This oily character. More and more news comes out about him. The FBI now says this guy would wear disguises everywhere he went. It was unbelievable. Even when he went and got a haircut, he would put on a disguise. In fact, he was such a stickler about his identity, he even once bought a fake ID from the Bush daughters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Egyptian archaeological team says people who worked on the pyramids 5,000 years ago received free medical care. How do you think that makes people working at McDonald's feel, huh? 5,000 years ago, Egyptian slaves had a medical plan and you don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this story in the news? The government is spending $590,000 to figure out how to make catfish dumber. They're doing this because they figure dumb fish will be easier to catch. Apparently, smarter fishermen is out of the question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the Gary Condit saga? . Here's what he would do. He would call up a beauty parlor and he would use the name 'Greg,' and he would go into the beauty parlor with a hat and sunglasses and a disguise. That's how he would go in. And I'm thinking, 'Well, that's the first thing you want your congressman to be, a master of disguises, don't you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about the Code Red computer virus? It's just crazy there. It's affecting the White House computers. It's taken over the White House computers, this computer virus. This is a great example of the difference between the Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration. Honestly. In the Bush Administration, it's the computers that go down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news story this week seems to be former President Clinton moving into his new office in Harlem. You know, this guy, he's just moving into an office. Huh? You think Marcus Garvey was coming back or something, the way this thing was going.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he knows how to play the media, God bless him. Like today, Clinton, said this is what he said. He said he wants to be very environmental. So he's now looking for people to car pool with. Yeah, yeah. A lot of people who work in Harlem live up in Chappaqua, don't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton also says his new office feels just like home. In fact, so much like home last night he snuck in the back entrance at 3:00 AM just out of force of habit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reported yesterday a guy was looking over Clinton's shoulder when Clinton was at the ATM machine. This is unbelievable, this is true. They reported that Clinton keeps $1 million in his regular checking account. $1 million in his checking account. So once again, just a typical Harlem resident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the media scrutiny is starting to get to this Gary 'Slimy' Condit guy. The other day, he and a photographer got into some kind of a shoving incident. I guess they bumped into each other, and Condit angrily pushed the photographer. At one point Condit was so mad, he almost stopped smiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Gary Condit was questioned by the Washington, DC police for the fourth time the other day. And you know, we've been making fun of them, the DC police, okay? But in defense of the DC police, that's four more times than Robert Blake got questioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the blue ribbon panel headed up by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford has come up with a list of ways to improve the next presidential election. Hey, I got an idea. How about better candidates?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Florida's Secretary of State Katherine 'Cruella de Vil' Harris. You remember her? 'I'll get you, my pretty, and your election, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, she's running for Congress. But listen to this -- she's now being investigated for budgeting $3.5 million for overseas travel. Seems she went to Argentina, Panama, Brazil, Venezuela, Barbados, Mexico, all at taxpayers' expense. But she has a good excuse. She says it's part of her program to see how third world countries fix their elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington, DC, police now say that Condit is no longer the focus of the investigation. And when Condit heard that he said to himself, 'Well, hey, maybe I didn't do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton's got his brand-new office up and running up there in Harlem. He's very excited. Yesterday he held his first office meeting in the new office while he was having sex, so he's off and running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton's new office has everything. It's got the state-of-the-art equipment. It has the well-paid staff. It has the tight security. And now all he needs is, well, an actual job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's only been in the office a couple of days and he's still trying to figure out the new office phone system. And earlier today -- listen to this -- he accidentally took a call from Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner of Atlanta's Gold Club -- you know, where the big scandal was with all the athletes. This guy Steve Kaplan pled guilty to one charge of racketeering, and as a result, he's had to turn over the strip club to the Federal Government. The government is now running the strip club. So you know what that means -- no more free sex for athletes. Now it's reserved for congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, this week, most members of Congress will be leaving town as they begin their August recess. See, this makes me uncomfortable. I mean, I don't know about you, I don't like entrusting my health, my money and my welfare to any adult who still takes a recess, you know?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the House approved drilling in Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge. . This has divided the country, but this points out the differences between our major political parties. See, the Republicans drill wherever they want, the Democrats drill whoever they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, California Senator Dianne Feinstein -- woo! Was she mad today. Did you hear about this? She's furious at Gary Condit. She says she cannot forgive Gary Condit for lying to her. I guess he told her he didn't have an affair. She said she can't forgive him and there's nothing he can do. And Condit said today that's okay that she's mad at him right now 'cause he said, 'You know, makeup sex, that's the best thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's choice to run the FBI, Robert Mueller, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. They needed a new FBI chief because, as you know, they misplaced the old one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush does not do well with African Americans, but he's trying. He promised the Urban League today that if they support his education reform plan, he'll try -- let me emphasize this -- he will try and make sure the ballots of black people will actually be counted in the next election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A blue ribbon panel headed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford came up with a list of ways to improve our next presidential election. Are these the best guys for the job? Ford and Carter? I mean, between the two of them, they could only win one election, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And William Kennedy-Smith -- remember him? He was acquitted of sexual assault charges in that sensational trial. . He said no to becoming a US congressman. Earlier in the week, he said he might run for Congress, but now he says no. But then again, with him, no might not always mean no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida Secretary of State Katherine 'Cruella de Vil' Harris -- you know her. She's running for Congress, now being investigated for budgeting $3.5 million for overseas travel. $3.5 million? How does she spend so much money on travel? Couldn't she just hop on her broom when she wanted to go somewhere?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton getting $8 million for his memoirs. Isn't that unbelievable? In fact, the publisher said today it would have been $10 million if Clinton had agreed to tell the truth, but good luck with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new medical study released today, beer may actually be good for your heart. You know what that means? If Jenna Bush would just give her beer to Dick Cheney, we could take care of two problems at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are back to normal for former President Clinton, he's now in his office building up there in Harlem, and it's a fantastic, brand new. Yeah, sure. Fantastic new office. He's got, like, a 360-degree view, which is great. He can see Hillary coming from any direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got the staff, he's got the big office, and, you know, too bad he doesn't have a job. So he sits around in his office and, honestly, he's got nothing to do. For example, earlier today, you know, to kill a little time, he Xeroxed his ass, and then he faxed it to Carmen Electra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself. They're busy up there. They say on any given day, they'll have as many as up to, like a dozen people in the reception area, or as it's also known, his lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this heat wave's going on around the country. Boy, this is something, isn't it? Woo! In fact, it was so hot in Washington today, Gary Condit was sticking to his story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? An angry -- very angry California Senator Dianne Feinstein lashed out against Gary Condit yesterday. I'd never seen a politician tag another politician like this. She announced that Gary Condit's career is finished and she will never, ever forgive him. So it sounds like Gary forgot to call someone the morning after, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it looks like Condit is being abandoned by the Democratic Party. They want to walk away from this guy. Imagine that? You're being abandoned by the party that stood behind the Kennedys, Gary Hart, Dan Rostenkowki, Jesse Jacknson and Bill Clinton. This is like gettin' kicked out of Sodom and Gomorrah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit's lawyer said today that Condit will be going on a retreat. You know, like his fugitive brother did before he got caught by the cops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Gary Condit's here in California. He came back for the congressional recess. I love this. But his aides said today he will not meet with voters until he spends some quiet time with his family. Oh, that's gonna be real quiet, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced that he's gonna be away from the White House, taking the entire month of August off. Wow, who among us hasn't needed 30 straight days off after working 6 whole months? Woo! Take a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is Bush taking a break? Cheney's the guy that needs time off. Huh? The man's had 18 heart attacks in 13 weeks. Give the man a break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard the prosecution has reached a plea-bargain agreement in that racketeering case against the Atlanta Gold Club. Under the terms of agreement, the Federal Government will take control of the strip club. How frustrating is that for Bill Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think about this. Eight years in the White House, and the Federal Government gets its very own strip club only six months after he leaves office. He could have been commissioner of lap dances, do you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day, with much fanfare, President Clinton opened his new office in Harlem. And the word is well, President Bush a little jealous of all the attention Clinton was getting. In fact, now there's talk that Bush might want his own office in the White House, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Clinton's got this office, it's 7,000 square feet, beautiful -- he's got no job. The man doesn't know what to do with himself. In fact, Clinton was so bored yesterday, he actually called just to chat with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Al Gore has grown a beard. Did you see him on the news today? He didn't want to grow a beard. It's just after he lost to George Bush, his doctors took away any sharp objects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But God bless Al Gore. He's bounced back. . Look at this -- he got a new job. He's now the Brawny paper towel guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the past few days, Congress has been debating the ethics of cloning. And for many in Congress, this is their first experience with the subject -- not cloning, ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the House finally approved a bill that would ban all forms of human cloning. The bill claims that human cloning is an irresponsible use of human DNA. And believe me, if there's anybody that knows about irresponsible use of human DNA, it's our US Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon announced today plans to let Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin' Donuts provide food for our troops. What was the thinking behind this, huh? What, were our soldiers gettin' through the obstacle course a little too quickly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you think about it, does Kentucky Fried Chicken even want to get involved with the Pentagon? The Colonel's secret recipe, will be in Chinese hands within 24 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. The House has approved drilling for oil in the Alaska wilderness. Say what you will about Clinton, but he was only interested in drilling in the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, our senator, got her first bill passed - a ban on cock fighting in New York. . Remember when she was running for the office, people said she would not listen to the concerns of New Yorkers? Well. . And now that cockfighting has been outlawed, New Yorkers got nothing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he went on his month-long vacation, President Bush had a complete physical at Bethesda Naval Hospital. At 12:00, doctors examined him and he turned out great. Tip-top shape, perfect health. MRI showed nothing. Cat Scan showed nothing. X-ray of his head showed nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad our President is in perfect health, but it's not the same excitement as when Clinton would go in for a physical. Because with Clinton, there would always be, like, five or six urologists there, you know. You never know what strange disease he might have picked up. 'More penicillin! We need backup! More penicillin!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment during Bush's examination. I guess the doctor said to Bush, 'Stick your tongue out and say ah.' And he said, 'You mean at the same time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush taking the entire month of August off. This is what he said. Bush said today he thinks it is important for a president to spend time away from Washington, or at least that's what Dick Cheney told him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Vice President Cheney is also on vacation. He's in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. What a better place for a guy who's had four heart attacks. He's in a place with thin air, rugged hiking and all-beef dinners. Why don't you get him some snow to shovel while he's out there, too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't this unbelievable? I mean, all of Washington is shut down. Congress is in recess. Bush is gone. Cheney is gone. In fact, it is so lonely in DC now, the NRA and the tobacco companies just handed money to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie 'Original Sin' opened this past weekend. Or as Gary Condit would say, 'Hey, it's not that original. I've been committing that sin for years. That's nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Senator Dianne Feinstein said she is still furious, furious, with Gary Condit for lying to her. Can you imagine that? She was lied to by a politician. Boy, now she knows how we feel, huh? Hey, welcome to the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did you see what Condit said? Condit said technically he wasn't lying. And today Bill Clinton said, 'Very good, Grasshopper. You learn well. Snatch the pebble from my hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to New York publishers, former President Bill Clinton will get more money for his book than Hillary got for her life story. Well, duh. At least his book has some sex in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, we have a copy. I guess this is an advanced copy of the book. It's called 'The Man From Hope My Wife Don't Find Out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said Gary Condit has flown back to California for the month of August. . He said he came to California to have a heart-to-heart talk with his family. Yeah. From what I understand, he's agreed to a fourth interview with his wife right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a huge article in 'Talk' magazine this month about Gary Condit. And they say Gary Condit may have a sexually transmitted disease. They didn't say what the disease was, but two of the symptoms are lying and having a creepy smile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore has returned to the United States after a long vacation in Europe. Did you know he was gone? Vacation from what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he went on his month-long vacation, President Bush had a complete physical at Bethesda Naval Hospital. At 12:00, doctors examined him and he turned out great. Tip-top shape, perfect health. MRI showed nothing. Cat Scan showed nothing. X-ray of his head showed nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad our President is in perfect health, but it's not the same excitement as when Clinton would go in for a physical. Because with Clinton, there would always be, like, five or six urologists there, you know. You never know what strange disease he might have picked up. 'More penicillin! We need backup! More penicillin!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there was one kind of embarrassing moment during Bush's examination. I guess the doctor said to Bush, 'Stick your tongue out and say ah.' And he said, 'You mean at the same time?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush taking the entire month of August off. This is what he said. Bush said today he thinks it is important for a president to spend time away from Washington, or at least that's what Dick Cheney told him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Vice President Cheney is also on vacation. He's in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. What a better place for a guy who's had four heart attacks. He's in a place with thin air, rugged hiking and all-beef dinners. Why don't you get him some snow to shovel while he's out there, too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't this unbelievable? I mean, all of Washington is shut down. Congress is in recess. Bush is gone. Cheney is gone. In fact, it is so lonely in DC now, the NRA and the tobacco companies just handed money to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Senator Dianne Feinstein said she is still furious, furious, with Gary Condit for lying to her. Can you imagine that? She was lied to by a politician. Boy, now she knows how we feel, huh? Hey, welcome to the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did you see what Condit said? Condit said technically he wasn't lying. And today Bill Clinton said, 'Very good, Grasshopper. You learn well. Snatch the pebble from my hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to New York publishers, former President Bill Clinton will get more money for his book than Hillary got for her life story. Well, duh. At least his book has some sex in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, we have a copy. I guess this is an advanced copy of the book. It's called 'The Man From Hope My Wife Don't Find Out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said Gary Condit has flown back to California for the month of August. . He said he came to California to have a heart-to-heart talk with his family. Yeah. From what I understand, he's agreed to a fourth interview with his wife right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a huge article in 'Talk' magazine this month about Gary Condit. And they say Gary Condit may have a sexually transmitted disease. They didn't say what the disease was, but two of the symptoms are lying and having a creepy smile.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush went on a four-mile hike down in Texas yesterday in 100 degree heat. Walked for four miles, and then finally admitted he didn't know where the ranch was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now Bush says -- see this today? He said he's being stalked. Yeah, Bush said today that wherever he goes in Texas, there are people following him. Then they finally said, 'Psst, those are Secret Service agents.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post reports that when you add up all the time that Bush has spent at the ranch in Texas, he was there for a whole month. Then you add the time he spends at Camp David, then the time he spends at his parents' house in Maine, and then add up all the travel time gettin' to and from these places, it adds up to 42% of his Presidency. In fact, he'd actually have to win a second term just to complete his first term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton being paid more than $10 million to write his life story. There's no exact figure yet 'cause there's no exact story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's Clinton's new book right here. It's called, 'I Like Them Fat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton is being paid more than $10 million because he is promising to tell the truth. See, this is what I love about democracy. This is what's great about America. Ken Starr spent over $50 million for Clinton to tell the truth. Clinton never said a word. Random House gives him $10 million, he tells everything. You know what we should have done? What we should have done -- we should have given Clinton $10 million, skipped the impeachment trial and save $40 million right there off the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The $10 million that Clinton is getting for his book beats the old record of $8.5 million paid to the Pope. For nonfiction books, the Pope holds the record at $8.5 million. Clinton beat that. Clinton got $10 million. How do you think this makes the Pope feel, huh? The man dedicates his life to the Ten Commandments, he gets $8.5 million. Clinton breaks every one of them, he gets $10 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just a few hours ago, Clinton's brother Roger pled guilty to reckless driving charges. He plead guilty, and that's not his biggest problem. Listen to this. It turns out while he was under oath, he gave his occupation as a singer, and now they got him for perjury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A naked pregnant woman was seen running through the corridors of the Capitol building in Washington yesterday. Naked and pregnant running through the Capitol. Boy, that's gotta be every congressman's worst nightmare, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Congressman Gary Condit was with his wife. Well, statistically, it was bound to happen sooner or later, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit, been married 34 years. Clinton's been married, what, 20- something years. See, that's the secret to a long marriage -- the husband never stops dating, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon announced this week they're gonna let Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin Donuts provide the food for our troops. Well, that'll whip 'em into shape, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you feel about human cloning? Doctors -- doctors playing God? I mean, isn't that why we have HMOs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is taking a working vacation at his ranch in Texas, and he says he hopes to spend most of his time jogging, golfing and fishing. That's what he said. Ah, that's right. The President says he'll be back in Washington in September where he plans to spend most of his time jogging, golfing and fishing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Elizabeth Dole is considering running for the Senate. Might run for the Senate. . When asked about it, Mrs. Dole said, &quot;Anything to get away from my husband and his little blue pill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton &quot;has agreed to write his memoirs for a record $10 million, which is even more than the $8.5 million the Pope was paid for his memoirs. Pretty interesting. It's true. True story. Yeah, apparently, Clinton says he's getting a lot more than the Pope because he got a lot more than the Pope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so hot, former President Clinton undid his fly just for the ventilation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's times like this that I'm proud Hillary Clinton is our junior senator from the great state of New York. . She is trying to put together a bill now that will outlaw cock fighting. Finally, a politician listening to the voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton had been mulling over titles for his memoirs, but they already told him he can't use 'The Ass Menagerie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the President out of town, the Bush twins took the opportunity to relax in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And do you believe how many shark attacks there have been this year? . But when you actually look at the statistics, there still is a much greater chance of you being attacked by your congressman. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington is really quiet, nothing going on. The whole town is shut down. In fact, there are so few congressmen left in town now a lot of mistresses are being forced to go out with single guys.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the US has decided to ban the cloning of human beings. Apparently, the great fear with cloning is if you clone a human being, the second generation will not have the same mental capacity as the first. You know, kind of like George Bush and his dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before he went on his month-long vacation -- month long, that's pretty good. Bush had a complete physical at Bethesda Naval Hospital. In fact, he said today, 'What is all this talk about reforming health care? I walked in, there were 14 doctors, they took care of me right away. I was in and out in an hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush played golf yesterday. And I understand Vice President Dick Cheney also got in a couple of strokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Bush's handicap is in golf? Trying to add up the score.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush today was hammering nails in 100-degree heat -- God bless him -- down in Texas at one of those Habitat for Humanity projects. This is a terrific group. They build houses. He was building a home for an unemployed man. I tell ya, Al Gore really appreciated it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although President Bush is on a working vacation, the Republicans are very sensitive about this. They are calling it a working vacation. His aides said today he does plan to read a number of mystery books. I think any book Bush picks up is pretty much a mystery, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably know by now, former President Bill Clinton has over $10 million in his pockets. $10 million. Has there ever been a better time to be a Hooters waitress? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton's $10 million book deal broke the all-time record for a book deal that was held by Pope John Paul II. Pope John Paul II got the most. Now Bill Clinton's getting more money for his book than the Pope. Well, it is nice to see the good guys win one for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize Clinton -- God, he's getting $1 million for every commandment he broke. Do you realize that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just like Clinton, the book will come with a jacket and no pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it should be exciting. I think it will be exciting. You know Clinton -- there will be a climax on every page with that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There'll be something happening every second of the day. In fact, you know who wrote the forward for the book? Patrick Ewing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, the President's brother Roger Clinton got a new movie - 'Driving Miss-Demeanor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about this. Yesterday in Los Angeles, Roger Clinton pleaded guilty to reckless driving charges, thus maintaining a perfect record of a Clinton never being innocent of anything, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon announced this week they're going to let Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin' Donuts provide the food for our troops. . You know, it's not a good sign when they start issuing helmets that have three chin straps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that big trial, the strip club trial down there in Atlanta? Well, you know, the government took it over. They closed it. And now politicians in Atlanta want to bulldoze the Gold Club strip club and transform it into an outdoor park they say will beautify the environment. They're going to knock it down. Congress is opposed to it. Yeah. They say you can't destroy the natural habitat of the North American lap dancer. That's an endangered species.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton signed a $10 million deal to write a book by 2003. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, and get this not only that, President Bush signed a $10 million deal to read a book by 2003.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so hot in Washington, for the first time ever, Strom Thurmond's body temperature rose above 50 degrees.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, Republicans in Congress went to the Arctic Wildlife Refuge just for the Arctic part. They weren't even drilling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An angry George Bush defended his long vacation in Texas today. He said people who criticize him are gonna have to look him in the eye when he gets back to work next January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Bush explained he has what's called a faith-based approach to work. See, that's when he spends all his time golfing, jogging, hiking, fishing, and then he prays someone else gets all the work done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard that while President Bush was in Texas, he helped to build another one of those Habitat for Humanity houses. And god bless him, that's a wonderful thing to do. But, really, would you want to live in a house that George W. Bush helped put together? Every time you turn on the lights in the living room, the toilet flushes. Come on, you're gonna go nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see what Bush helped build today down there in Texas? Take a look, take a look. Here he is. He's helping -- okay, he's got -- there he is, hammering something. Can we get in close, see what he's making? Look, a little electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush still trying to prove to reporters that he can grasp international affairs while working at the ranch. He's not out of touch. Like, the other day, he said he spoke to the King of Jordan, and he asked the King of Jordan, 'So, are you coming back to the NBA next year? What's gonna happen?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also said he's the kind of guy who needs to get outdoors, as opposed to Clinton who didn't like the outdoors, because there was no place to corner women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Clinton got $10 million for his new book. He's calling it an inside look at Washington. Here it is. We have a copy of the book right here. It's called 'Below the Beltway: By Bill Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you probably heard, Bill Clinton's brother Roger -- Roger Clinton got probation the other day on a reckless driving charge. One condition of the probation -- you cannot associate with any criminal element. So there pretty much goes the Clinton family reunion this year, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is holding hearings on movies like 'American Pie 2.' They say they want to prevent young Americans from seeing sexually explicit films. Congress is concerned that teenagers may copy this behavior and start having sex with other teenagers instead of sex with old men like them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush...defended his vacation by saying, 'Being outdoors keeps my mind sharp.' That's what he said. Apparently, this is the first time he's been outdoors in 40 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, last night, President Bush announced his decision on stem cell research. He said if this research can produce a better cell phone, he is all for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it was a tough, agonizing decision for the president. He said he was on the phone for six hours yesterday talking it over with Ms. Cleo.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush, I guess he came up with a compromise plan. Interesting. He says he will now offer each cloned fetus a $300 tax break. So I think that -- that should please everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush also said the reason he is only for limited stem cell research is that human life is too sacred to tamper with -- which has got to be a surprise to all those guys.on death row, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seriously, this was a tough one for Bush. Because no matter what choice he made, it was a no-win situation. You know, kind of like what we had to go through during the last presidential election. You know what I'm saying? There's no winner on this. We're screwed no matter what happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so hot in New York City, Bill Clinton actually went inside his office in Harlem. He's never done that before. Actually went in the building. Can you imagine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it was so hot in Washington, the Supreme Court took off their black robes, only wore black speedos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it was so hot today, in Modesto, California, Gary Condit was heard telling a woman 'get off me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the long-awaited expose on Gary Condit came out in 'Talk' magazine. I tell ya, I read this thing -- one bombshell after another. Listen to this, 'Talk' magazine believes they have evidence that Gary Condit may have cheated on his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA headquarters fire caused over $1 million worth of damage. Actually, it would have been a lot less. But when they called 911 to report the fire, being the CIA they refused to tell them where they were. Give them any further details. 'There is a fire. That's all we can tell you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all, of course, watched President Bush's speech last night, right? . No, he spoke last night. Last night, in case you didn't see it, which is most of you -- in a primetime address, President Bush said he backed limited Federal funding for stem-cell research. That's what he said. It's a big announcement. . The president said -- this is a quote. The president said, 'the research could help cure brain diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and whatever it is I have.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week President Bush -- you know, he's on vacation. Well, he took time off from his vacation to do something nice in Texas. He helped build a home for Habitat for Humanity. He helped build a home for a single mom. Isn't that a nice thing to do? I thought that was very nice. . And not only that, former President Clinton offered to take the single mom out for drinks. That's right. And then he said, 'cause I like the booby.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does he say that? He shouldn't say that anymore. That's causing trouble. He always gives a great speech, and then stops, and everyone thinks that's good, and then he goes, 'I like the booby.' Like no! Don't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A record number of school districts all across the country already have kids coming back from summer vacation. . Some of them started a week ago.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, that was the great thing about Clinton. One day of dancing on the beach with Hillary, that's it, vacation's over. He's ready to go back to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he is taking 30 days off because being outdoors keeps a person's mind sharp. Yeah, that works so well for the homeless, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush reiterated his stand to conservatives opposing his decision on stem cell research. He said today he believes life begins at conception and ends at execution, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a news bomb shell that was in today's 'US News and World Report.' They say plans are being discussed as to who will replace Dick Cheney if he has to resign for health reasons. It's not easy for President Bush. You can't just name a replacement. He would first have to be confirmed by the oil, gas and power companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was first reported that former President Clinton would be getting $10 million for his book. He is really getting $12 million. The $10 million is just what he told Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit went to see 'The Vagina Monologues' the other night. He said, 'Too much monologue, not enough vagina.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit issued a very angry press release today saying that his hometown newspaper never should've called for his resignation. He said they should first hear his side of the story, just as soon as he comes up with it. His people are working on it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said 30 years of public service should have earned him that much. See, Condit believes that a long history of loyal service should be respected. Yeah, I'll tell that to his wife when I bump into her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fidel Castro had a birthday today. Fidel Castro is 75 years old. He has been hinting recently about retiring. So you know what's ironic about that? Castro could wind up one day living in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George W. Bush continued his vacation by playing an early morning round of golf in Texas. . You are the weakest on the links. Good-bye.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After playing golf nearly every day on vacation, Bush's handicap remains his intellect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush decided he needed a vacation because besides the energy crisis, the economic crisis, arms crisis, environmental crisis and crisis in the Middle East, the country seems to be running just fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush shot a 98, but after a call to his brother Jeb, Katherine Harris knocked it down to 67.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani taking steps to shut down Time Squares' last remaining strip club. Gonna shut it down. We have to applaud Giuliani. He wants to make New York City a decent place to bring your mistress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the lipstick industry, the average woman swallows three pounds of lipstick in her lifetime. But then again, so does Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Gary Condit lashed out at his hometown newspaper, the Modesto Bee.for printing editorials calling for his resignation. You know, I think he better watch it. The way his career's going, a couple of years from now, he could need a job delivering those papers and I don't think he should be attacking them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post today, Gary Condit is gonna run in 2002. He's gonna run -- not for Congress, from the law. Apparently, he's just started realizing, they can start closing in about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said his wife helped him make the decision. His wife helped. Apparently, she kicked him out of the house. He's got nowhere else to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fidel Castro celebrated his 75th birthday. Isn't that nice? He's really getting up there, yeah. And you can tell that Fidel is getting old because he's thinking of retiring and moving to Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Miss America pageant is considering adding an academic competition where contestants have to -- listen to this -- where contestants have to answer multiple choice questions about history. True story. Yeah, which means, folks, it may actually be harder to become Miss America than it is to become President of the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, Gary Condit was hitting on frozen embryos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, Democrats are getting behind Al Gore just for the shade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the White House, doctors say George Bush has the lowest heartbeat ever recorded by someone in the White House. Well, second lowest. Dick Cheney got his down to zero a couple of times.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That guy who was supposed to be executed in Texas -- remember they were gonna execute a guy in Texas? A 23-year-old guy got a stay of execution. And a disappointed President Bush said, 'Damn, I planned my whole vacation around that. That's what I was down there for.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush attended a baseball game between the Colorado Rockies and the Atlanta Braves. Baseball? Where does he find the time in his busy schedule, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he even sat in his favorite seats in the far, far, far right field. The far right field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today that President Bush is next gonna climb an 8,000-foot mountain while he's there in Colorado, and cynics say, 'Oh, this is just an attempt to impress the media.' But you know? We always see Bush jogging and he's hiking, he's golfing, he's playing baseball. If he wants to impress the media, get a picture of him doing some work. You know? Sit behind a desk, signing a bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like today, they showed him in Colorado clearing some trees on the path. Don't we have people that can do this? Aren't there other people that can maybe handle this job? Do we have to bring in the President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey, the number one thing women are looking for in a man: honesty. Yeah, that explains why Clinton and Condit do so well with women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;USA Today reporting that Gary Condit is currently on a family vacation, but he did not bring his wife. She did not go. I'm sure that's just an oversight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Gary Condit's gonna run for reelection. Do you believe this? Do you think he'll be reelected? Do you think he will? You know, I think he's got a good chance. Hey, if you lived in Modesto, wouldn't you vote to get this guy the hell out of town?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is still on vacation. It's apparently a nine-month vacation. He wants to relax after his three months in office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While President Bush was visiting Colorado, he went on a hike through Rocky Mountain National Park at an altitude of 8,000 feet. Pretty impressive. Yeah. Apparently, the President hasn't been that high since college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuban President Fidel Castro celebrated his 75th birthday this week, and he had a giant party that included Elian Gonzalez. It's true. Elian was at his party. Yeah, apparently, the party went really well until Elian stole the cake and tried to sail it to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, Gary Condit actually shed his skin, that's how hot it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush lashed back at critics who say -- what, he is on a six-month vacation? They say his one-month vacation is too much time away from Washington. Bush said today, 'Hey! The President on 'West Wing' gets four months off with nothing but reruns. Nobody attacks him. Why is that? Because he's a Democrat, that's why.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night that guy who was supposed to be executed in Texas, Napoleon Beasley, received a stay of execution. Got a stay of execution. Or as Bush is calling him, 'The one that got away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times reported today that at his wife's birthday party in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Dick Cheney -- the Vice President -- Dick Cheney had a huge steak and battered onion rings for dinner. Isn't that unbelievable? Then afterwards, he met with 100 donors. Not campaign donors, heart donors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now possible to protest in front of the White House by hiring a stand- in, okay? Listen to this. I'm not making this up. You e-mail this company about what issue you're mad about, and they provide a sign and your own personalized protester to stand in front of the White House and picket the President. How fat and lazy has this generation become?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jesse Jackson's mistress, Karin Stanford -- you know the woman who had his baby? She's being interviewed by Connie Chung for '20/20.' It's supposed to be on tomorrow night. Yeah, yeah. And Stanford says she does not think it was hypocritical of Jackson to counsel Bill Clinton on adultery while she was pregnant with his child. That's what she said. No, she said, 'Who better to give advice than someone who walked in your shoes?' Which is true. But as you know, Clinton wore rubbers on his shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
