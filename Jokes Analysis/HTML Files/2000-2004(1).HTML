<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Presidential candidate Gary Bauer -- you know him, the little guy there? I think he usually sits on Reggie White's knee. He says the Vermont Supreme Court's decision to recognize gay couples is worse than terrorism. Really? Wouldn't you rather have a gay couple living next door than a terrorist? At least his yard would be nicer, wouldn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the National Enquirer -- listen to this -- Linda Tripp recently had a face-lift. And the bad news, the doctor who.gave her the face-lift got a hernia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A woman artist, she uses her breasts to paint with. She dips them in paint and then she presses them on a canvas. And she's doing quite well. In fact, today Clinton asked her to paint his official White House portrait, yeah. Clinton also offered to help clean the brushes, which I thought was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush had a quote today. He said that if elected President -- this was his big statement -- if elected President, he would not object if a guest wanted to light up and smoke at a state dinner. That was his statement. That's what he said. That's right. Yeah, Bush says he only hopes they have the courtesy not to hog the crack pipes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Also in politics today, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura said he will not.support Pat Buchanan in his bid for the nomination in the Reform Party. Not going to support him. He had a reason. Ventura explained, 'I'm sorry, but Buchanan's ridiculous views conflict with my ridiculous views. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that in the past few months Linda Tripp, we all know and love her -- this is what she's had -- she's had a nose job, a chin tuck, neck reduction, and liposuction. She's had all of that done.  Yeah. True story. Not only that, not only that, she is now taping conversations in Dolby stereo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;People are going crazy celebrating early. In fact, down in Washington, President Clinton spent the entire day playing with a noisemaker. . I believe her name is Rhonda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;According to The National Enquirer, Linda Tripp had a plastic surgery makeover to improve her looks. And that's good. Now, after the surgery, Linda Tripp's doctor upgraded her condition to 'very unattractive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Linda's operation included a chin tuck, a facial peel, and what we call a snout job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewinsky.has some Jenny Craig commercials she's doing. . Monica has opened up and said the reason she finally decided get help with her weight was she looked down and realized she couldn't see the President's feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Preparations almost complete in Times Square. . One thousand cops have been assigned to protect government buildings and three secret service guys are guarding the Mayor's hairpiece.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Washington, DC, boy, they had heavy security for their millennium celebration. In fact, this is interesting - the police were urging people to call in if you saw anything at all suspicious. And I guess thousands and thousands of people called when they saw Bill and Hillary holding hands.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the Drudge Report, at the Clinton's New Year's Eve party, at the White House, a Secret Service agent caught three people having sex together in a White House bathroom. Now, when Clinton said he was bringing Syria and Israel together, I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're having sex parties in the White House, and Hillary hasn't even left for New York yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Monica's commercial? She's lost 31 pounds. In fact, she's already dropped three desk sizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Big news from Russia. New Year's Eve, Boris Yeltsin resigns. . He says he's sorry, he apologizes, and he would like to be forgiven, and then he resigned. And I'm thinking, jeez , wouldn't it be nice if we could get a president like that, wouldn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yeltsin said he was having more and more trouble running the country since he passed away two years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight, Monica Lewinsky was on the Larry King Live television program. . And I think she took live phone sex calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;She was on with Larry King for the entire hour, which is 55 minutes more than President Clinton ever spent with her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Boris Yeltsin Resolutions 10. Run for Senator of New York. 9. Tell new guy to wear 'Hello, My Name Is...' tag if he meets with George W. Bush. 8. Taking cue from Will Smith, release new rap album 'Yeltsinium.' 7. Finally get around to trying this vodka Russia is so famous for. 6. As prank, walk by bread lines announcing 'The 8:15 showing of The Green Mile is sold out.' 5. Buy new liver on eBay. 4. Get in on the swing dancing craze. 3. Personally check all three of Russia's computers for Y2K compliance. 2. Write letter to Wynonna Judd and tell her how he really feels. 1. Remain alive until at least February. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A huge New Year's Eve celebration at the White House over the weekend. It got out of control. Everyone partied a little too hard. The President got so drunk he actually did it with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewinsky was on the Larry King show earlier tonight and she said.she is now casually dating. Of course, by casual Monica means she's only using one kneepad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica told Larry she actually wants to have a baby, which is kind of nice. She says if it's a boy she's going to name him after the great love of her life. No, not Bill Clinton: Haagen Daas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big gossip in Washington is the Secret Service allegedly caught three people having sex in a White House bathroom during the big New Year's Eve Christmas party. See, how do they know it's three people? See, how do they know it just wasn't Clinton and one of his big girlfriends?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, that's terrible, sex in the White House bathroom. Don't they know that's what the Lincoln Bedroom is for? That' that's why you pay 10 grand a night.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, I feel sorry for the next president, regardless of who it is. Carpet stains all over the White House. I think Clinton should not get his security deposit back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you know by now, Monica 'Mouth of the Potomac' Lewinsky now doing commercials. She's now doing commercials for a diet plan. I bet you there are a lot of guys interested in getting their women on the Monica Lewinsky plan. 'Honey, I don't care if you lose weight. Just try it. It's supposed to be pretty good.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you read her interview in USA Today the other day? She said. in looking for a guy, she looks for the element of trust. And you know, if you can't trust a married guy, who can you trust, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica said last night dating is not easy for her. Aw. I can imagine why, huh? You think maybe the men she goes out with have a certain expectation as to how the evening might go?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They brought up President Clinton. And she did say there will ways be a small room in her heart for President Clinton. And President Clinton said today there will always be a small room for her, too. It's that little study off the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like Elizabeth Dole has endorsed George W. Bush for president. You can see why. They do have one thing in common. He's the only other Republican out there who powders his nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Monica Lewinsky said that she is 'looking for Mr. Right.' That's what she said. That's right. And Monica went on to say that she doesn't think she'll find him till after the primaries are over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin is reported.to have stashed $15 million in a Swiss bank account. That's what they're saying. And Yeltsin said, 'There is nothing dishonest about it. I won that money playing quarters.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The three-way meeting between President Clinton and the leader of Syria and the leader of Israel has been canceled. I just found that out. Yeah. And when asked about it, the President said, 'Sorry, but I promised Hillary, no more three-ways.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tomorrow night in New Hampshire, we have the big debate. We have Al Gore, and Bill Bradley head-to-head, mano a mano in New Hampshire. And people are exited because tomorrow night, Al is going to unveil his new gaucho look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you folks saw Monica Lewinsky on 'Larry King Live' last night? Exciting, wasn't it? Monica told Larry that she hates having lost her privacy. She hates the fact that she no longer has any privacy. That's what she told Larry. She also told that to Barbara Walters, she told that to 'USA Today,' 'Entertainment tonight,' the AP, Reuters...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Monica continues to exercise bad judgment. She's now dating Puff Daddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Monica told Larry.she always wanted a husband. Well, Monica, mission accomplished, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewinsky last night was on 'Larry King Live.' And she told Larry, she told Special K that she's casually dating, seeing a guy right now. And Larry said, 'Is he the one?' And Monica said, 'Close but no cigar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Elizabeth Dole has officially endorsed George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination. While no longer a presidential candidate herself, she says she is still running from her husband's erection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush says he was pleased by Dole's endorsement because it showed that the pineapple industry is solidly behind him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, it's Wednesday, or as they call it in the White House now that Hillary's moved out, hump day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Hillary Clinton has begun moving out of the White House this week. This is the story. Yesterday, three full moving vans left the White House for the Clintons' new home -- where is that, Chappaqua, New York? Three full moving vans, and that was just for the lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I can't wait to see how the neighbors react when Bill's stuff starts showing up, you know, all the stuff from Arkansas, the velveteen Elvis paintings. You know what I'm saying? The Astroturf for the porch, you know, the car up on blocks in the front yard.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To help with the move, Hillary's opponent, Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- you know, they're supposed to be archrivals -- sent over some cardboard boxes to help her move. Now, he did. He did. Unfortunately, he took them from homeless people who were living in them at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's going on tonight? President Clinton is flying up to stay in the house. Hillary and Bill are gonna spend their first night in the new house together. I understand President Clinton's a little nervous. Well, you remember how it was the first time you slept with someone. You don't know what they like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in his new budget, President Clinton now proposing $10 million to help develop smart gun technology. Are you familiar with this? With smart gun technology, the gun will only work if it's handled by you, not if it's held by another. If it's handled by you, it will work. If it's held by another person, it won't go off. And today, Hillary says she wants the same technology installed in the President's pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton was in West Virginia yesterday with Israel and Syrian leaders for those Middle East peace talks. Then he's heading down to Atlanta for peace talks with Jane Fonda and Ted Turner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Who would have thought the man with the most stable marriage at CNN would be Larry King?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch Monica Lewinsky on 'Larry King' the other night? Yeah, she told Larry she's seeing a therapist now. Just hope his wife doesn't find out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;She also said on 'Larry King' the other night that she'll always have a small room in her heart for President Clinton. Today, President Clinton called and said, 'I'd like to reserve that room for the weekend.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;For a woman who says she's not a media hound, she is doing a lot of interviews. She is on everything. This could be the first time she's ever got chapped lips just from talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boris 'Buy Me a Drink' Yeltsin. Yeltsin, you know, he's a private citizen now. He announced today he would like to continue working for the government, for the Russian government, in some capacity. Maybe something like Ambassador to Margaritaville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This woman in New Mexico has come out of a 16-year coma. Did you read about this? Woman had a baby, went into a coma, just came out of it. 16 years in a coma. And I guess she's doing okay. Doctors told her to take it easy. They told her, take walks, and, for God's sakes, avoid watching any of the Al Gore-Bill Bradley debates. They said that could plunge her right back in again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Tonight, Hillary Clinton will spend her first night in her house in upstate New York. And this prompted President Clinton to ask, 'Is it too late to change my New Year's resolution?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Ways The White House Is Different Now That Hillary Has Moved Out: 10. President no longer sleeping alone. 9. Faucets in master bedroom now dispense scented message oil and gravy. 8. Forget dress down Friday - now all-nude Friday and pantsless Monday through Thursday. 7. Volumes of Hillary fan mail redirected to new house. 6. Hillary no longer writing volumes of fan mail to herself. 5. No pressure to cuddle. 4. Token male intern transferred out. 3. Oval office covered with 'Vote Giuliani' posters. 2. Women's soccer team no longer has to win World Cup to spend night at White House. 1. Menorah taken off living room mantle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Alan Greenspan has been convinced to stay another term as the Chairman of the Fed, you know. He said he'd do it under one condition: he wants in on some of that hot intern action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Clinton moved from Washington to her house here in New York. She and Janet Reno, they swung by Ryder and moved themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary spent the day unloading boxes, and boxes, and boxes of personal stuff, or as we call it, evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now her husband, Bill Clinton, says that when he's out of the White House, he'd like to move back to Arkansas and run for Senate, as well. So, you have Clinton, Bill, living in Arkansas, Hillary living in New York. And I'm thinking, I hope this doesn't put a strain on their marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Boris Yeltsin had a couple of stiff belts and resigned on New Year's Eve. And we're learning more and more about his successor, the acting president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. He has a black belt in Karate. And I thought, that's a coincidence right there, because Bill Clinton, our President, has a black belt. It's usually down around his ankles, but that's not the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Ted Kennedy endorsed Al Gore. Gore was so excited, he lost it and claimed that he invented the liver transplant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Pat Buchanan said he's expecting a big upsurge now because with Y2K put behind us, his constituents are now free to leave their bunkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;In West Virginia, they are trying to solve the Middle East peace problem. The negotiators from Israel and Syria -- President Clinton was there yesterday, trying to encourage them, trying to get these guys to finally make a lasting peace in the Middle East. It's very tough to get these negotiators to renounce violence, because if you do, first of all, if kills any chance of ever dating Jennifer Lopez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Clinton is planning to spend her very first night in her new home in suburban Chappaqua, New York. Tonight, Bill Clinton is planning to spend the night with a band, a bathtub full of margaritas and 45 waitresses from Hooter's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;According to the movers, packing up the President's things was simple. Everything he cherishes fits neatly into a humidor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Mrs. Clinton isn't planning to spend too much time setting up their home because it's a matter of days before Bill wrecks it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A McDonald's ad running in Hong Kong has angered officials from China's army because it shows a boy offering french fries to a soldier. .  This is the second time McDonald's has offended China. In an ad last year Ronald McDonald was seen making an illegal campaign contribution to Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Media mogul Ted Turner and actress Jane Fonda say they are separating. Or, as it's called these days, moving to Chappaqua.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Stunned by the news, President Clinton called Jane Fonda to say, 'Come on over. Hillary's gone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. What a hot crowd! Oh, man! Thank you very much. Man! What a crowd. You sound like President Clinton when he heard Hillary was moving out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday Hillary Clinton moved into her new home in Chappaqua, New York. It's considered an affluent bedroom community. As opposed to the White House, which Clinton turned into an affluent community bedroom.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And you know, last night President Clinton spent the night there.  He slept over, which is a new record for him, the whole night in one bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see on the news, footage of Bill and Hillary helping unload the moving van? They're really into this thing. The way it works, I guess the moving guy would hand a lamp from the van to Hillary, and then Hillary would throw the lamp at Bill's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many watched the debate last night? The big Al Gore-Bill Bradley smackdown 2000, yeah! Did anybody watch? No, nobody watched.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I watched about a half hour of it. I felt like that kid in the 'Sixth Sense,' 'I see dead people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why are these two even debating? You know, it's like arguing the difference between Spam and Spam light at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, finally, Monica Lewinsky described exactly how she lost the 31 pounds. She says her secret, between meals, no longer snacking on presidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you hear about Jane Fonda and Ted Turner have separated? And you know, I think it's serious, too, because today Jane Fonda bought a house in Chappaqua, New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Clintons moved into their new house in New York yesterday. They moved in for the first time, unpacked their stuff -- very big story. And White House press secretary Joe Lockhart described the couple as 'excited.' That's what he said. Yeah, yeah. He then admitted that it's very seldom when at least some part of the President isn't excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin has embarked on a trip to the Holy Land. Did you know that? He went to the Holy Land. And, of course, the Holy Land to Yeltsin is Milwaukee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, Bill Clinton, President of the United States, and his wife, Hillary Clinton, the first lady, moved from the White House down there in Washington, DC, to their brand-new home in Chappaqua, up there in Westchester. Hillary, understandably, was quite excited. But you know, to Bill, it's just another one-night stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;When the Clintons looked at the calendar and realized it was time to move, they were going to have all of their friends help them move, and then they realized, of course, all their friends are in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Moving for the Clintons is no big deal, because they've had the U-Haul since the impeachment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Clinton wants to be our senator, and life in New York for Hillary Clinton is tough. . For example, every day, she has to memorize the name of the new Jets head coach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Clintons bought that house up there in Chappaqua, and they did a lot of work on it. Put a new roof on the house, put a new floor in the house, put a new garage. Next, they're going to add a cement pond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary was busy all day today. She had to unload the boxes, had to unload the tables, had to unload the chairs. Now all she's got to do is unload Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Cuban kid's going back. . At the end of the day, you have to say, it's like the old saying, 'If you love something, set it free. If it's meant to be, it will come back as a baseball player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Clintons moved into their new house, and Bill was not supposed to go with Hillary on moving day, but he did. They spent the first night together, last night in the house together. And you know how a new home is, there's all sorts of strange noises at night. Apparently, Hillary, at one point during the night, got so scared that she got up and went into Bill's room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Monica Lewinsky is doing Jenny Craig ads because she lost a lot of weight. Now, Jenny Craig franchises, some of these franchises, refuse to run the ads. They say they're in poor taste, which they may have a point because in one of the ads in the 'before' picture, she's wearing a semen- stained muumuu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Gore/Bradley debate last night. . It was full of, they said, put- downs and one-liners. You know, I'm not kidding. Politicians actually hire comedy writers, and I think Gore may using some of Sonny and Cher's old writers, because two of his zingers had to do with Bradley having a flat chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Clintons, as you know, spent their first night in their new home in New York last night, in Chappaqua. Clinton said he didn't get a good night's sleep. For one thing, it takes quite a while to get used to a new couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bill and Hillary christened the house in the traditional fashion by not having sex in any of the rooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sure you know by now, Bill and Hillary Clinton have moved into their new home in the small community of Chappaqua, New York. . You know, 'Chappaqua' is an old Indian word meaning 'place to dump the wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We got Hillary a housewarming gift. Can't go wrong with a map of New York. I think she might need that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's funny, today a reporter asked President Clinton, 'How does it feel to spend the night in a strange house?' He said, 'Oh, hell, I do that at least four nights a week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see this on the news, they showed Hillary and Bill walking around their backyard, holding hands. Did you see that? You know, it's kind of like that footage at the zoo, where they put the two pandas together. You know they're not sexually attracted. You just hope something will happen. You know, they put them in the cage, they walk around. 'Hey look, maybe they'll do something. Oh, no, I guess not. The male does not seem interested.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton told reporters that he and Hillary stayed up late the other night unpacking boxes. And they discovered possessions they hadn't seen in 17 years. Like every time they'd pull something out of a box, Hillary would say, 'Oh, my God, I remember who you were cheating on me with when we first got this item.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's got to be strange, don't you think? Opening boxes and seeing things you haven't seen in 17 years. Then they went upstairs, got undressed for bed and the same thing happened. They saw things they hadn't seen for 17 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of cynics are saying the Clintons are using this as an excuse to engage in a trial separation. You know what that is, a trial separation? That's when they're separated, but stay married so they can't testify against each other at their trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore really went after Bill Bradley the other night. Whoo! Did you see that? He said Bill Bradley's health care plan will leave the American people 'high and dry.' I always like that. You always hear politicians use that expression, that somebody will leave the people 'high and dry.' You never hear them say somebody will leave them 'low and wet.' Okay, maybe Clinton, he's the only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the first primary is next month in New Hampshire. In a few weeks, you know, you'll see the number of candidates start to dwindle down. You know, when you watch this political race, it's kind of like keeping a tank of tropical fish. You know what I mean? Every once in a while you look in, you count them. There's not as many as there were before. Until there's only one left and he's really fat and mean, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, to protest the decision to return that 6-year-old boy back to Cuba, a large group of Cuban refugees in Miami intentionally drove very slowly on the freeway. Drove slowly around town, blocking traffic. So you had thousands of immigrants driving really slow in the fast lane blocking traffic -- or as we call that in LA -- rush hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bad news today for Linda Tripp. Oh, boy. Did you hear about this? Oh gosh. Today her body rejected her new face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As I'm sure you know, Linda Tripp underwent extensive plastic surgery and liposuction. I don't know.just because you put an awning on the outhouse doesn't make it a guest room, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: (The theme from &quot;The Hillary No-Billy&quot;:) &quot;Come and listen to my story about a girl named Hil, who was sick and tired of that cheatin' no good Bill. Got so fed up with the women on his lap that she loaded up the truck and bought a Yankee cap -- New York that is. Senate seat up for grabs. Well, the next thing you know she's bought a brand-new house, trying to put some distance from that no-good horny louse. Now Hillary is out on the campaign trail, while Bill is back home chasing intern tail -- girls that is. DNA, Jenny Craig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton was in New York all this week getting settled into his brand-new home in the suburbs. And yesterday -- true story -- two of his neighbors dropped off bottles of champagne. Isn't that nice? I thought that was sweet. Not only that, but three other neighbors dropped off restraining orders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Jenny Craig franchises in Wisconsin and Iowa are refusing to air the Monica Lewinsky ads because they say Monica is not a person to look up to. That's right. That's what they said. True story. And this is the weird part: Monica actually agreed, and said, 'You know, usually, I'm the one looking up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Donald Trump today told reporters there was, quote, a very good possibility he would announce he's running for president next month and he said if he runs he will commit $100 million of his own money, $20 million towards the campaign and the rest for something The Donald calls 'tang.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night Republican presidential hopefuls Bush, McCain, Forbes, Hatch, and Bauer all competed on TV's hottest new game show, 'Who Wants To Be A President?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The new issue of People magazine has scooped its competitors with exclusive pictures of Linda Tripp's plastic surgery. She had an eye job, neck tuck, and skin peel and while she was under, doctors figured she might as well get spayed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Boris Yeltsin and Yasser Arafat.attended an Orthodox Christian service yesterday. Between the two of them, needless to say, everyone got bombed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Pat Buchanan called a press conference to distance himself from John Rocker.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They showed President Clinton on the news the other night, walking around his new neighborhood, introducing himself to the other parents in the neighborhood. He didn't want to, but they had to because New York state has that sexual predator notification law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I was watching news the other night, and one of the newsmen said, 'Clinton's new house has a big backyard for Buddy the dog to bury his bones. ' Which is the same thing Clinton's going to be using the guest room for.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many watched the Republican debates the other night? You know, I feel sorry for some of those other candidates, like Orrin Hatch. I like this guy. Did you see, the first question the moderator asked him was, 'What the hell are you doing here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And George W. Bush is starting to speak out, starting to finally give some opinions on the issues. Like when they asked him about gays in the military, he said he was a 'Don't ask, don't tell' man. When it came to drugs, he was a 'Can't say, don't remember' man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We are in the middle of the deadly cold and flu season. . Here's good news, though. The folks who make Sudafed, a couple of weeks ago, introduced a brand-new non-drowsy Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Good Things About Having a President With A Temper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Fun to hear White House spokesman use phrase 'road rage'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 4 words: Vice President John Rocker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Sam Donaldson would find himself on a raft to Cuba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. New monument: Tomb of the Unknown Guy Who Looked at the President Funny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Instead of jar of jellybeans on desk, president claims to have 'can of whoop-ass'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. State of the Union address begins with the words 'Hulk mad...'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Years from now, it would be cool to have coin with a guy giving the finger on it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Ends each radio address with 'Well, I see it's clobberin' time'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Goodbye presidential veto -- hello guy named Vito hired by the president to break legs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Look how well it worked for Nixon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In an obvious attempt to score political points, Al Gore has reversed his stand and now says gays should not be allowed to serve in the military, though when pressed he said he could not say for certain whether actor Kevin Spacey should be allowed to serve in the military.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like that 6-year-old boy from Cuba can stay in the country. . Do you know why? Turns out his father's David Crosby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know, the town of Chappaqua, New York, welcoming the Clintons with open arms to their lovely community. Local businesses are rolling out the red carpet. And today one dry cleaner, now offering one- hour Clintonizing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview yesterday, Hillary Clinton now says.she opposes same- sex marriages. And she's pretty tough on the issue. I guess she figures gays just won't have that same strong marriage bond and commitment that she and Bill have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that ad in USA Today, 'Secret Service is Now Hiring'? They're looking for recruits. No, they're actively pursuing people who would like to become members of the Secret Service. They're low on staff. What a coincidence, huh? Hillary moves to New York. Bill's alone in the White House. Two days later, the Secret Service is calling for reinforcements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton announced that she opposes -- she's against the legalization of same-sex marriages. . She said marriage should remain as it has always been -- between a woman, a man and his intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton wants $30 million from Congress for contraception and family planning. . It sounds to me like somebody's getting ready to go dating again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton says that he plans, in the next election, to vote here in New York City.so he can vote for his wife. . I think the last time he actually voted for a woman, yeah, she was wearing a wet t- shirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;That Time Warner/AOL deal went through. Apparently, that's really going to happen. . It does put to rest anybody who thought that the Internet was not here to stay. The Internet is here to stay. . In fact, even Strom Thurmond today said, 'I got to get me one of those dot-com machines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Secret Service has announced that for the first time, they have to recruit. They are placing help wanted ads if you want to be a member of the Secret Service. They said they've been losing a lot of agents lately because the agents realize after a few years that they could make a lot more money being a pimp in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Whoo, did you see the Republican candidates? Oh, man, it looked like a bad robot show at Chuckee Cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other night they did a report on the Republican candidates. And they asked them each what their first jobs were. It was interesting. I guess, George W. Bush, his first job, runner at a law firm. That's what he did. John McCain, his first job, newspaper delivery boy. He delivered papers. And if Steve Forbes gets elected, his first job will be President of the US.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an effort to appeal to voters, Donald Trump has lost 35 pounds -- his girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess he broke up with that supermodel girlfriend. She was here, very attractive. He broke up with her. Same old -- it was over sex. It was over sex. Apparently, during sex, she got in the way and interfered with Trump's view of himself in the mirror over the bed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton was in Arizona yesterday, where he designated some land for the National Park Service. Then he went for a hike, three miles down into the Grand Canyon. You know, at first it was reported that Clinton rode a pack mule, but it turned out that was just his date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Then he went on a sightseeing tour by Arizona's Virgin River. Clinton didn't go in the water. He just stood at the mouth of the Virgin River.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton, pretty excited about moving to the suburbs of New York. He told reporters today he had never done it with a soccer mom before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton is starting to give her opinions. She's now against same- sex marriages. She opposes them. And the way things have been going for her, I'm surprised she doesn't oppose all marriages -- I mean, no- sex marriages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a very bizarre story. According to the National Enquirer - - and you know, they check, recheck and then double-check the facts again. . Actor Jan-Michael Vincent -- remember him? . Anyway, it seems he was recently rushed to the hospital after he took Viagra and was aroused for four days. Four days! They took him to the hospital. Hey, Clinton's been walking around like that for the last 7 1/2 years. I don't see anybody rushing him to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Apparently, this is not good news for her, but in the paper, Hillary Clinton is slipping in the polls. Have you heard about that? She's not doing so well in the polls. Apparently, one of the reasons is that she's not connecting with female voters. That's what they're saying. True story. Yeah. Right. Hillary said, 'You know, it's hard to connect with women when you've called them at 3:00 AM and told them to stay the hell away from your husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Presidential candidates George W. Bush and John McCain did something pretty interesting. They shook hands, and they agreed not to take part in any negative advertising. Isn't that cool? I thought that was neat. Yeah. I think, though, they've gotten a little carried away, because George W. 's newest ad says John McCain is a patriotic American and a great kisser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Five of the nine candidates for president had their first jobs in media related fields. That was interesting. They all worked in media, I guess. It's true. Steve Forbes worked in a magazine's mailroom. Bill Bradley was a paperboy. And Al Gore worked as a radio antenna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;First Lady Hillary Clinton is on the program tonight, ladies and gentlemen. I'm a little nervous. This, of course, means just about this time tomorrow: I'll be getting my ass audited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I've been thinking about this long and hard. I came up with one question, and this is what it will be: 'Is the government controlling the weather?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Questions Dumb Guys Would Ask The First Lady:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. So, have you actually, like, met the President?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Did you ever rebuild your house after it got blown up in 'Independence Day'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. What's your stance on that guy in that country doing that stuff?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. How about a Federal law making shoes easier to tie?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Aren't monkeys funny -- especially when they're smoking and dressed like people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Do you have one of them robot maids like in 'The Jetsons?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This is the White House, right? Well, gimme some of them square hamburgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Is it wrong for the President to appoint his own wife first lady?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If elected Senator, would you please, please, please bring the strip clubs back to New York City?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Have you ever met my dad, George Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bidding is now under way at Sotheby's for one of the 25 original copies of the Declaration of Independence. Some experts are questioning the authenticity of this particular document, which begins, 'We, the peeps, in order to keep it real.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Janet Reno, our Attorney General, wants to set up a vast national network to monitor cybercrime, because, you know, there's a lot of crime on the Internet. She said the problem is that people on the Internet too easily can change identity. Women can pose as men. Men can pose as women. Kind of like a bar she used to go to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess the first big snowstorm of the year hit back East today. You know, all the candidates are talking about it. Anything they can -- any excuse -- and Steve Forbes said today the snow reminded him of when he was a little boy. Whenever it would snow, he'd get all bundled up and jump on his toboggan, and then the chauffeur would jump in the front and steer it down the hill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I felt bad for Al Gore. Did you see him on the news? Spent all day building this snowman, and then tonight, the snowman endorsed Bill Bradley.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, Attorney General Janet Reno -- or as the kids call her, the 'Iron Giant' -- said the court in Florida has no jurisdiction over that 6- year-old Cuban boy. How do you say his name? Elian, Elian Gonzalez, yeah, yeah. Reno said she wants Elian Gonzalez to go back to his father where he can live a normal life without TV cameras in his face 24 hours a day. And today, Jesse Jackson said, 'Hey, what's wrong with that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, I have a solution. I have a solution to this whole Cuban thing with this young boy. Let the boy stay with Bill and Hillary Clinton in that new home in New York. The home has five bedrooms. Bill and Hillary are only going to be using two of them. I say, let the kid have the extra one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You probably know about this, Hillary Clinton this week came out against same-sex marriages. And actually, President Clinton said today he feels the same way. He said he believes marriage is a sacred institution in which one man enters into a union with one woman and cheats on her and her only.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;You know he (Donald Trump) and his girlfriend separated. It was in all the papers. Everyone's talking about this. The newest wrinkle on this is that Donald Trump's lingerie model girlfriend -- I envy this man -- his lingerie model girlfriend says that she broke up with him because Trump cheated on her. That's what she says. Yeah. Yeah, which got me thinking, 'Hey, maybe this guy is presidential material.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;First Lady Hillary Clinton was a guest on the show. . And afterwards, she, and me, and Walter Cronkite, went to Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I really think that her appearing on this show last night could actually help her career, you know? I really do. I wish it would do something for mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Things Hillary Clinton Whispered To Me Before The Interview:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. May I leave now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Al Gore was right -- you do smell like a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Will there be time for me to do a song?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. At this instant, my husband has 3,500 Tomahawk missiles pointed at you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Do you mind if I give a shout out to my homie Ol' Dirty Bastard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. I can't believe I'm going to sit in the chair that Tony Danza sat in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. You have an audience? The show always seems so quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Just thought you should know, your announcer made several clumsy passes at me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. I need $20,000 and a speedboat -- don't ask why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. And you are...?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Get this. Ten percent -- that's a lot when you hear what I'm going to say. Ten percent of Americans have something in their body that wasn't there when they were born. And they say there's no Clinton legacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The US Post Office has announced plans to raise the price of a stamp now to 34 cents. That's ok. Good news, the estimated $40 million in additional revenue they're going to use to open a second window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A guest appearance by the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, last night on 'David Letterman' created quite a stir. While Hillary was on Dave, Bill was on an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary says there's another show she'd like to be on. No, not 'The Late, Late Show.' It's that new syndicated one, 'Divorce Court.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;You know, if Dave Letterman can get Hillary, I'm starting my own campaign to get Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman on this show. Dan, what are you so afraid of? If you want to make it in the world of agriculture, you have to pay the toll here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The weather back East -- man, it is so cold in New Hampshire today, Steve Forbes' tongue got stuck to the silver spoon in his mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, they had to jump-start Al Gore, it was so cold this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And this flu, man, this flu that's going around killing people. In fact, George W. Bush sneezed so hard today, his Kleenex had a street value of $2 million.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Experts now say there's new evidence of global warming. New evidence. Scientists say the earth has warmed up half a degree in the last 20 years, half a degree. And today, President Clinton says, 'You know, so has Hillary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton announced new protections for whistle-blowers in the airline industry. Clinton said, 'People who know how to blow a whistle are our most cherished workers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a story that's rocked the entertainment industry. Boy, this just hit today. Didn't know anything about this. Seems the White House has been reviewing TV scripts of TV shows like '90210' and a lot of these other shows. And if they like the message in the script about drug use or whatever, they give the networks financial incentives. This is unbelievable. You know, that explains that episode last week of '90210' where Tori Spelling announces that oral sex isn't really sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know Donald Trump has split up with his supermodel girlfriend. Yeah, they broke up. Apparently, she did something that damaged the relationship forever. Yeah, she turned 25.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you know that during George W. Bush's term as Texas Governor, 113 people have been executed. 113! In fact, it is so busy now on Texas' death row, the last meal is a buffet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like the fate of that 6-year-old boy down there in Miami is going to be left to the courts. According to the experts, in these kinds of cases, whenever the mother is deceased, the father.in American courts, has a tremendous advantage. Well, duh, we're the country that gave O. J. the kids back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Mayor Giuliani announced that he's gonna start seizing the cars driven by problem motorists. He will take the cars away. And Giuliani described problem motorists as anyone who has a bumper sticker that says 'Hillary for Senate.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton was in New York yesterday. Anybody see him around? Ladies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Well, anyway, he was in New York yesterday. And last night - - true story -- a cab hit one of the escort cars in the President's motorcade.  Big news, yeah. Luckily, no one from the escort service was hurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush argued this week that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez should not be returned to Cuba, saying it's in our best interest to keep the pressure on Fidel Castro until he allows free elections, free press and frees the prisoners in that island. To which Elian replied, 'I'll see what I can do. But keep in mind, I'm 6.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;While appearing with his wife on ABC's 'This Week,' Bob Dole maintained his support of John McCain, even though Elizabeth has publicly endorsed George W. Bush. While they did not agree on which candidate to support, the Doles did agree on one thing -- there's something pretty creepy about Gary Bauer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Senator John McCain took on Washington's most powerful special interest Tuesday by calling for an end to billions of dollars in tax breaks for large corporations. General Electric, Newscorp, Viacom and their subsidiary television networks said they wish Senator McCain luck with his new ad campaign, the Windield Flyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;The bickering between Democratic Presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley escalated this week when Gore accused Bradley of being 'bad for the economy,' and Bradley responded, 'Really? That's not what your mother said.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;According to press reports, Peter B. Lewis, an insurance billionaire and supporter of George W. Bush's campaign, was arrested in New Zealand last week, allegedly carrying two ounces of hashish and ounce of marijuana, prompting an obviously concerned Bush to demand, 'What happened to the rest of it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;The California State Assembly will vote this week on a bill requiring prospective handgun buyers to pass a written test. This would replace the current verbal test which requires gun dealers to ask customers, 'Seriously, you're not going to shoot anybody, are you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;The US Postal Service this week began the year-long process necessary to raise postal rates, calling for an increase in first-class postage of one or two cents. The surplus money will be used to buy thousands of new signs that read, 'This window closed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Later this month, Congress plans to consider a bill that would outlaw betting on collegiate sports. Pundits are calling the measure too little, too late, however, as it's now been a week since I took Virginia Tech with the points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Happy Martin Luther King Day. Or as John Rocker calls it, Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;We didn't get a day off. Although the White House said, think of it as 'a day on,' not 'a day off.' And to that note, a lot of people around the country were volunteering, doing special things, painting schools, reading to school kids. In fact, for example, school kids in Boston marked the occasion by picking up trash, which also served to honor President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Havana, Cuba, several thousand protesters rallied in a two-mile-long parade to demand the return of Elian Gonzalez. . Gonzalez, now in Miami, has to make a choice: live in a world of senseless violence and abject poverty or he can go back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke optimistically about the robust American economy and stock market. He then told members of the club, 'We still face one looming hazard, errant bullets fired by Puff Daddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;John McCain running for the Republican nomination, I guess he's the number two guy now. He says he never tried marijuana. And you know, he was in Vietnam for five years, but he said the drug use in Vietnam got popular after he was a prisoner of war. Although, he did say that at one time he got so bored in prison, he actually tried to smoke a roach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night Al Gore and Bill Bradley held their final debates. While the two disagreed on many issues, they both agreed David Crosby should stay far away from Al Gore's daughters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In the celebration for Dr. Martin Luther King yesterday, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Reverend Al Sharpton. She said it was a genuine pleasure to share the podium with someone she was generally certain her husband had never slept with.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Supreme Court is reviewing Colorado's buffer zone law.  . That is the law that says if you go into an abortion clinic, the anti- abortion activists have to stay eight feet back from you, because they do not want patients being harassed. Because one thing these women don't need is haranguing and pressure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mean, that's what got a lot of them there in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night the Pentagon tested a new weapon, its anti- missile defense system, which, unfortunately, missed its intended target. . The mock warhead continued in an arc and eventually smashed safely into Fabio's nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The defense system also had problems last month, when it failed to intercept Bicentennial Man before it hit theaters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The CIA is engaged in its first-ever public recruiting campaign. It appears to be working although it's hard to tell because all of its classified ads are classified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In an interview with a Buffalo newspaper, Hillary Clinton said she plans to stay married to husband Bill for the rest of her life. President Clinton would not comment on his wife's statement because he was too busy looking for some rope and a nearby tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A spokesman for Hillary said the First Lady wants to spend the rest of her life with the President because it's the only way she could possibly get even.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This is January 20th, Inauguration Day, which means this is the first day of President Clinton's final year in the White House. And you know what that means? Seven-year itch!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;In Canada. they want to put graphic, I mean graphic pictures of diseased lungs on the packs of cigarettes. This to deter people from smoking. They have also, by the way, asked Monica Lewinsky for a picture of her ass to put on Ho-Hos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The White House said today they are going to stop its practice of reading scripts beforehand to see if they're anti-drug or not. President Clinton said it's too controversial and besides, it's no fun watching 'Dawson's Creek' when you know who's going to get nailed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Today is January 20. That means President Clinton has exactly one more year in office. . One more year. So from today that's just, let's see, 365 interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Along with the rest of the northeast, Washington, D.C., has been blanketed in almost six inches of snow after an unrelenting winter snow storm.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;It was so cold in Washington that President Clinton called an emergency press conference on the White House lawn just to see all the nipples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Navy has announced it's re-establishing ties to Tailhook. . They said they've changed their image and announced a new slogan: 'It's called Tailhook, now with 30% less grab ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore was a much bigger pot smoker than he previously admitted. One source says Gore smoked the reef right up until he ran for Congress . Well, that makes one thing official -- pot smoking is no longer cool.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of Al Gore's best friends from his younger days claims that Al used marijuana regularly for years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me tell you something. Now, you see, Al Gore smoking marijuana: if that doesn't prove to young people once and for all that drugs are not cool, nothing will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;While we were off last week, maybe you heard about this, Hillary Clinton got in an argument with a telephone-radio interviewer in Buffalo -- this is a big story -- over a very personal question. You probably saw this on your news. It turns out, the whole thing was a big misunderstanding. I guess the reporter asked Hillary, 'Have you ever committed adultery?' and Hillary said, 'Honey, it's for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary let the reporter know, in no uncertain terms, that her sex life was none of his business. And, later, when President Clinton was asked about it, he said he felt the same way. He said, 'Hillary's sex life is none of my business.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Watergate tapes of former President Richard Nixon went on sale last week. Have you heard these things? Oh, man. Nixon swears so much in these tapes, they're now thinking of re-releasing them as a rap album.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The biggest snowstorm in four years hit Washington, D.C. . They say there's so much snow, all nonessential federal employees were asked to stay home. You know, if they're nonessential, why don't they stay home every day, all right?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You all watch the results of the Iowa caucus last night -- or carcass -- a lot of Iowa carcasses lying around there, whoo. You thought Bill Bradley had heart problems before, oh, my God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush declared the big winner in the Republican caucus. You see him on the news? Man, I haven't seen him this happy since he passed his last urine test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is a pretty good indication of what's gonna happen in November, Gore and Bush. It'll be like the cokehead versus the deadhead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you believe this rumors going around that Al Gore smoked a lot of dope when he was a kid? Who would sell him -- he looks like a narc, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve Forbes came in second. Actually, Steve Forbes said he learned a lot about Iowa while he was there. For example, he said, 'Do you know there are other parts on a cow besides the filet mignon?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As reported, Orrin Hatch will drop out tomorrow. He's gonna announce tomorrow he's dropping out. . He got 1% of the vote in Iowa. But the good new is, that exit polls showed he carried 100% of the vote of guys named Orrin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess President Clinton was here in Los Angeles again over the weekend. You know he's been in L.A. 60 times since he took office? That's more times than Hillary's been in New York. He could be our next senator from California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He was at the.the California Institute of Technology. And he gave a speech where he said he wonders a lot about why we age. That was his talk, 'Why We Age.' What's he talking about? He eats his meals at McDonald's. He sneaks out of the house in the middle of the night. He dates college girls.  Why we age? We're wondering why he never grew up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He also told 'The Christian Science Monitor' this week that he's working on how to forgive those who have wronged him. In fact, they said he's even asked Nelson Mandela about the art of forgiveness. Why is he asking Mandela? Why doesn't he just ask Hillary? I mean, how many times has she forgiven him? Do you remember Clinton ever cheating on Nelson Mandela?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Still no resolution down there in Florida, that little 6-year- old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez. I guess the grandmothers were down there. Well, I guess all grandmothers have to go to Florida eventually, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's something that I thought was nice. Listen to this -- If Elian does get sent back to Cuba, David Crosby has promised to help the relatives create a new baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;As a result of last night's Iowa caucus, Senator Orrin Hatch announced that he's going to drop out of the presidential race this week. But first, Hatch has to tell everyone he was in the presidential race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At a big Hollywood party, President Clinton met an actress from 'Baywatch Hawaii,' and he was overheard admitting to her that he has watched the show before. That's what happened. . Then he poured a glass of water over his head and pretended he was drowning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nice day today, but boy, terrible back East. Man, cold weather, whoo! In fact, in Washington today, President Clinton said he hasn't felt this cold since Hillary was living at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so cold in Washington, today, Al Gore came out in favor of global warming.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In New Hampshire it's so cold, George W. Bush spent the entire day shoveling white powder out of his nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see what the latest news is on that 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez. Now they're trying to make him a US citizen.which I think should be easy. I mean, he already speaks the language -- Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton commented on the Elian Gonzalez case. He said he is 99% sure he is not the father, so that's a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow night, President Clinton will give his annual State of the Union address. You know, it's interesting -- just by watching these State of the Union addresses, you can tell his marriage with Hillary is not going that well, you know? You know how the first lady would always sit up in the box seats? Remember when he first gave it in '92, and they'd always cut to her sitting right there? . Do you notice every year President Clinton has been in office, her seats have gotten worse?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Orrin Hatch has dropped out of the presidential race. You know, I don't know why he thought he was gonna do well. Even in the polls, he was two points behind the margin of error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Hatch's wife was really surprised by his announcement today. She said, 'I didn't even know you were running for president.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, Steve Forbes, he's still hanging in. But what is Forbes, really? He's just Orrin Hatch with an allowance at this point, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A big, big snowstorm, of course hit the East coast. . It's affecting the presidential race. Did you know this? Yesterday, true story, New Hampshire got hit with so much snow that the presidential candidates were having trouble making their campaign stops. . In fact, George W. Bush said he hasn't seen the ground this white since he tipped over a coffee table in college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During a Rio interview yesterday, the first lady, Hillary Clinton, said that some people have a problem with her because she's a woman, she said. Yeah. And when asked about it, President Clinton said, 'You know, my problem with her is that she's not several women.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, those snowstorms back East -- and you know, it's starting to affect some of the candidates, these snowstorms. In fact, some of the snowdrifts back East are so high, Pat Buchanan's right arm was the only thing visible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, it's so cold in Florida -- even in Florida, people were hugging that little Cuban boy for nonpolitical reasons.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now the boy's relatives in Miami are claiming that the little boy is suffering from human rights violations. They claim the Cuban grandmothers pinched his cheeks for more than two hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Police in Miami said there was a plot by Castro to kidnap the Cuban boy and bring him back home to Cuba. In fact, the plan was to wait until Sunday during the second half of the Super Bowl when everybody in America was sound asleep, and then sneak in and take him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton giving the big State of the Union. The state of the marriage, that's the one I want to hear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton's a big movie fan. He loves movies. And he's gonna be on the old 'Siskel &amp; Ebert' show. . It'll be the first time Clinton's been with someone Ebert's size that wasn't a date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton -- he's going to be on the balcony with an intern and demonstrate the old 'popcorn box in the lap' trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier tonight, President Clinton made the final State of the Union address of his presidency. You can kind of tell that Clinton's at the end of his last term, because he delivered the speech from his hot tub.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;President Clinton -- Wow, what a bitter sweet moment. His final State of the Union address that he gave tonight. And you know, he's feeling a little wistful, too comfortable perhaps.because, they always have that guest of honor in the balcony. Tonight's was a chick from the travel office named Aniqua.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;He really wanted to focus on his legacy and put all the scandals behind him. In fact, the theme of the speech was 'The Era of Big Girlfriends is Over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch President Clinton's State of the Union miniseries? It went on for an hour and 29 minutes. Interrupted by applause 119 times. Sounds like my wedding night.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I thought he did a great job. Terrific speech. Very uplifting speech. You know, I was watching him last night, speaking at the capitol there. And did you notice on the wall behind him, this oil painting? . I'm wondering, 'Whose portrait is that? It looks familiar.' Then I realized, it's not an oil painting, it was Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, every year, the State of the Union address answers the age-old philosophical question: 'What is the sound of one party clapping,' you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Could the Republicans be more sour? . They didn't applaud, they didn't stand up. You know, they looked like a bunch of straight guys who had wandered into a gay strip joint by mistake, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton also said that he had a new plan to go after Latin American drug dealers' money. And today, George W. Bush said he thought it was a great idea. He said, 'In college, those guys took all my dough. I am so mad. . I want to get some of that back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He also talked last night about getting rid of the marriage penalty. And, you know, for Clinton, the marriage penalty means having to sleep with the same one you're married to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Nebraska football coach Tom Osborne announced this week he's running for Congress. You know, he retired a couple years ago to do humanitarian work. And I guess the humanitarian thing didn't work out, so he's now going to join the other side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, football is a lot like Congress, you're just working with a different group of felons, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Florida's Supreme Court has struck down part of a state law that gave grandparents the power to seek court-ordered visitation rights with their grandchildren. The court says the state can't go against the parents' wishes, unless, of course, the parent lives in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A minor earthquake struck New Hampshire while the presidential candidates were campaigning. . Reporters actually say it's the first time in years they've seen Al Gore move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During his State of the Union address last night, President Clinton did what he always does. He acknowledged several heroes in the audience including an Air Force pilot named Captain Cherry. And there was an awkward moment when the President said, 'You know, my nickname in college was Captain Cherry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all enjoy the Super Bowl yesterday? . Man, that was an exciting ending, wasn't it? Everybody's heart was beating like Bill Bradley's.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all like the commercials? . My favorite one, that e- trade one where the patient had money up the wazoo. You know, when they said the guy had money up the wazoo, at first I thought it was a Steve Forbes campaign commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, all of the Sunday morning talk shows are still talking about President Clinton's State of the Union address. You know what my favorite part was? When President Clinton said, 'We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,' because you know Hillary's sitting there going, 'You bet your ass you are, pal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In New Hampshire, they showed all of the Republican candidates flipping pancakes. . Did you see (Gary Bauer) fall off the stage flipping the pancakes? . Forget about being president, this guy doesn't have the skill to work at I-Hop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest on that little 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez. Have you heard this? Now Cher is dating him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You heard the latest on those two Cuban grandmothers? You hear about this? Next month they're nude in 'Playboy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher : &quot;President Clinton was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. They say his chances are not good.because it's very rare that a sitting political leader wins the Nobel Peace Prize, especially one whose wife is not talking to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The other big political news, of course, the New Hampshire primary. . Apparently, John McCain on the Republican side has a razor-in lead over George W. Bush. Bush said he's not worried. He said he has seen razor- thin lines before, and they always disappear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big primary was today -- or as Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are calling it, 'New Hampshire, The Farewell Tour.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The networks declared John McCain a big, big winner in New Hampshire. . I guess this is the biggest setback for George Bush since he took his SATs, probably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Not a good day for Steve Forbes. . Friends say this is the worst setback for him since that big chardonnay shortage in 1993.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky has agreed to do her third interview with Barbara Walters. She's been with Barbara more than she's been with Clinton at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's going to be on Barbara Walters' TV show, 'The View,' and if she does well, they're thinking of giving Lewinsky her own interview show called 'The View From Down Here.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Playboy magazine is now publishing the second part of their Jesse Ventura interview. See, interviews with Jesse always come in two parts, the interview and then the apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Many Beltway insiders are questioning the strategy of Bill Bradley, whose new slogan is 'I am a big dork.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;We, here at 'The Late Late Show; fully endorse and ask that you vote for Gary Bauer. Why? Because we work at a comedy show. And, well, have you seen what this guy looks like?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The US mint has unveiled its newest currency, a $1 coin with the face of Sacajawea. Governor Bush was not in favor of the coin because it's impossible to roll up and snort coke through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton says the new coin costs less and is more durable than paper money but much harder to put into a stripper's g-string.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met yesterday with the Russian Foreign Minister. The meeting was going well until Albright demanded everyone refer to her as Butch Cassidy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez returned to Cuba without the boy yesterday. Fidel Castro was very sympathetic and said he didn't blame them for not bringing Elian back, and it was only with greatest reluctance that he had them executed by firing squad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy Groundhog Day, everybody. . George Bush spent today seeing John McCain's shadow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John McCain.won so big, George Bush called Regis Philbin today and said, 'Look, I'm going to take my $60 million and go home.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Experts say they haven't seen a politician get crushed like that since the last time Monica was on top of Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush, in a speech, said New Hampshire was just a bump in the road. That's what he called it, a bump in the road -- You know, kind of like the scene in 'Titanic' when the guy goes, 'What was that? Oh, probably just a little iceberg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve Forbes, he spent a fortune of his own money. What did he spend, $29 million, $30 million? He did not do as well as expected, but he said his campaign will continue, which is good news for his supporters, but, of course, bad news for his kids' inheritance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gary Bauer got less than 1%. He got less than 'Other.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gary Bauer said, 'No, I thought I did well.' He said he thought he did well. Apparently, he thinks of it like golf -- you know, low score wins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On the Democratic side, Bill Bradley finished a pretty close second to Al Gore. Political experts said today you could feel the electricity around Bill Bradley, but it turned out it was just his heart defibrillator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Bradley's cardiologist was on CBS yesterday to reassure voters that Bill Bradley is in fine health. And today, not to be outdone, Al Gore's mortician was on the Today show, saying pretty much the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's reported now that Monica Lewinsky will have her third interview with Barbara Walters on her TV show 'The View.' Third interview? Is there anything about this woman we don't know by now, really? I mean, unless she was also doing Hillary, what else is there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton announced today he will visit India. He's going to India for five days in March. I guess he wants to clarify some questions about position number 64 in the Kama Sutra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, spotted in Manhattan with his fianc looking at engagement rings. I understand it's going to be a double chin ceremony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Here are the results of the New Hampshire primary. John McCain did very well with independent voters. Al Gore did very well with party regulars. Gary Bauer did well among voters who were just kidding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Voters in New Hampshire said that unlike President Clinton, they want the next president to stand up for what he believes in. . They also said that unlike President Clinton, when the next president stands up, they don't want him to be aroused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's Groundhog today. And according to the results from last night in New Hampshire, Bush has at least six more weeks of John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;President Clinton, as of today, is set to sign a new law outlawing GHB. Do you know what GHB is? That is what they call 'the date rape drug.' . He says it's too late to give it to Paula Jones, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I really enjoyed groundhog day, yesterday, I really did. You know, wasn't it nice to finally see something crawling out of a hole in the ground that wasn't running for president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John McCain easily beat George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary, which just goes to show. See, when given a choice, people will take a hothead over a crackhead any day of the week.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is kind of licking his wounds today. He said he wants to put New Hampshire behind him and forget it ever happened. You know, kind of like he did with the entire 1970s, 'I don't remember a thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In his speech yesterday, Bush said New Hampshire's not a problem, because, 'getting beat will make us a better team.' . Oh, yeah, worked for the Clippers, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But he said he learned a lot. . In fact, now he said he wants to spend a lot more time working on his smirk. So apparently he's gonna try and get that down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve Forbes, he didn't do too well either. You know what's interesting, in 1996 Forbes got 12% of the vote in New Hampshire. 12% in New Hampshire. He spent $30 million. This year, he got 13%. So at this rate, in 150 years, he could go back and win this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now that New Hampshire's over, all the candidates have gone to different states. I guess Al Gore was here in California, came here last night. Steve Forbes, I think, went to Delaware. And I think Gary Bauer, I believe, is in the state of denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;(Bauer) is dropping out tomorrow. . After getting only 1% of the vote. He said he's not delusional, he was just hoping we were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently he got 2% of the vote in Iowa last month. But see, he only got 1% in New Hampshire. See, he peaked too early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I guess Gary Bauer got some good news today. About 4:00 this afternoon, he hit puberty. So that's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush now campaigning in South Carolina. . Did you see who introduced him on the stage down there yesterday? Dan Quayle. . Pretty clever strategy from the Bush campaign. These people are smart. This makes their candidate look more intelligent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton spoke at the big bipartisan prayer breakfast this morning, in Washington. Gary Bauer was there speaking, too. Actually, not speaking, he was flipping pancakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton.said his favorite movie this year is 'American Beauty.' I wonder why he liked that movie, huh? About a middle-aged man, unhappy in his marriage, who lusts after a young girl. What could he see in a film like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, President Clinton did complain about the current ratings system. He was complaining. He said, you know, he can't tell any difference between 'X' and 'XXX.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Due to a problem that they were having yesterday with Air Force Two, which is the way that he usually flies, Al Gore had to take a US Airways shuttle back to Washington yesterday. He had to get on a US Airways shuttle and fly back. And reportedly Gore spent the entire flight in the full upright and locked position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to exit polls in New Hampshire, they're just finding out what was on the voters' minds. Voters like John McCain, apparently, because he says whatever he thinks. . As opposed to George W. Bush who says whatever he can pronounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that Mayor Giuliani.has received a campaign donation from 'Wheel of Fortune' host Pat Sajak. That's right. Apparently, Sajak donated $1,000 and two vowels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush got the endorsement of Dan Quayle today. . Quayle said he is endorsing bush for three reasons. One, he is a true conservative. Two, he has the be chance of winning the Republicans. And three, Quayle says, 'He has the same name of the guy I used to work for. How weird is that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gary Bauer, the Christian right candidate, he is going to drop out tomorrow. Turns out, the voters wanted someone who looks slightly less than a maitre d' at a church picnic for dwarfs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gary learned a tough lesson of politics. You can pander all you want to the unborn, they just don't turn out to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bill Bradley wants an apology from Al Gore because.one of Bradley's surrogates is John Kerrey. . And Bradley says that Gore supporters heckled Kerrey, calling him a cripple. And Gore said, 'This is terrible.' He clearly told his hecklers to call him 'differently abled.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John McCain moving up in the polls. . There are people in the GOP now whispering that this temper might be too hot to be president. . I don't think so. I mean, after Clinton, it's nice to have a president with veins throbbing in his forehead for a change, don't you think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush supporters are comparing McCain to Bill Clinton. That's what they're trying to do now, compare him to Clinton. And they do have something in common. McCain is personable, Clinton is personable. McCain wants a tax cut, Clinton wants a tax cut. McCain was a prisoner of war for five years, Clinton is married to Hillary.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gary Bauer bowed out of the race today. Boy, I'm shocked. Got only 1% of the vote in New Hampshire. I guess that big endorsement from John Rocker just didn't pay off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, (Bauer's) hoping the Jolly Green Giant will give him his old job back as Little Sprout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve Forbes says he's going to stay in the race, despite his poor showing in New Hampshire. You know, this guy spent over $30 million to accomplish really nothing. . Forget the presidency, he should be in Congress with a record like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know the Cuban boy, who got visited by the two grandmothers? . When the grandmothers went back to Havana they did a TV interview, and they said.to get the boy to open up, they bit him on the tongue and unzipped his pants to see if he's grown. . President Clinton said he wants to meet personally with these grandmothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Presidential hopeful Gary Bauer has dropped out of the race for the presidency. Like Ross Perot before him, he said he had to accept the fact that America probably wasn't quite ready to elect an insane squeaky- voiced leprechaun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;At his press conference, Bauer thanked his supporters, then drove both of them home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Stepping up the pressure on the gun industry, today President Clinton announced new proposals to crack down on illegal guns. One innovative proposal includes making illegal guns illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Big box office news this weekend -- Scream 3 made $35 million. . Sequels are never a sure thing. They can be disappointing -- Speed 2, Jaws 3, George W. Bush. You see, the sequel is never what you expect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looked like Bush was going to walk away but now you got McCain getting scrappy in there. Looks like George is getting a little worried. Now he's trying to find ways to attack McCain. . He accused McCain of not filing taxes for five years during the Vietnam War.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They say in order to carry the election, Bush is going to have to get an enormous number of votes in his home state of Texas. Bush said today if he had known that, he wouldn't have executed half the people in the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dan Quayle has officially endorsed George W. Bush for president. . I think they worked out some kind of a deal, you know? Like I guess Bush promised him, if he's elected president, he'll let Quayle, you know, ride in the front of the limo and play with the siren and flash the lights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve 'Grey Poupon' Forbes still in the race. He's spending all his kids' money. The kids have to be going nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you heard his new slogan - 'Forbes, the white Urkel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton.officially announced her candidacy for the US Senate before a crowd of 2,000 of the party faithful. Well, 2,000 faithful plus her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton promised to bring more jobs to New Yorkers. But if she wins, isn't she taking a job from a New Yorker?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary might land a big job in New York before Monica Lewinsky. And she didn't even have to sleep with the President to get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Yesterday afternoon at a crowded press conference, Hillary Clinton made public what many had suspected. That's right, she killed Vince Foster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;She also announced her candidacy for the Senate, and the President used a chart to explain what he called 'my sex life with Hillary between now and 2013.'&quot; (Clinton was shown drawing a graph with an extreme downward slope)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The President said he stands behind Hillary 100%. Hillary then asked the President to stand more to the front and side where she can keep an eye on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;This counts as the first time a first lady has ever run for office, not counting the time Eleanor Roosevelt ran for mayor of Ugly Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Hillary Clinton has announced.she is actually running for the Senate. She said, 'The last few months have really been just sort of a dry run. And come to think about it, the last 15 years of my marriage are kind of a dry run.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;On the other side.John McCain, he's the guy with what they call 'big mo.' He's on the cover of all of the news magazines and George Bush is angry. He's out there. He's got a new whole thing. He went to the wizard. He got a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;(Bush) is blaming the media. He's a whole new guy, and he said that he knows about some of the mistakes he made up in New Hampshire. Among them, campaigning with his father probably was not a good idea. Nothing says strong and independent like standing on a stage with mumsy and dadsy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Following his loss Tuesday, Bush admitted the primary was the worst he had been beat since the time he bought 50 ground-up aspirins for 50 bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;McCain celebrated his victory by yelling at his family and punching out drywall in his hotel room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;With his victory, Vice President Al Gore might be getting a bit overconfident. Earlier today, he actually allowed his photograph to be taken with this man.&quot; (Picture of Bill Clinton and Al Gore shown)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;According to records released Wednesday, Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign received a large number of donations from Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise, Barbara Streisand and Steven Spielberg. Apparently, these principled celebrities are willing to go to any length to ensure that Hillary Clinton is elected to represent a state that they don't live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;As the deadline for nominations ran out this week, President Bill Clinton remained in the running for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. In recognizing Clinton, the Nobel committee cited the president's tireless work in preventing his wife from killing him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daryl Hammond: (As Bill Clinton in SNL) &quot;Looks like it's boiling down to McCain, Bush, Gore, and Bradley, four reputable men. Any one of them would make an honest, scandal-free president. Your next leader will show up where's he's supposed to show up, say what he's suppose to say, and conduct himself with decorum at all times, thus restoring dignity to the Oval Office. You're gonna miss me, aren't you? You miss me already.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and I guess you heard, it looks like Steve Forbes is throwing in the monogrammed towel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Word is he's going to drop out of the Presidential race tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah, see? It's true what they say, 'Good looks can only carry you so far,' you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, he dropped out after finishing a disappointing third in Delaware. I understand he locked himself in a wine cellar, wouldn't come out. I understand his daughters actual cried. They were crying, which is understandable. Hey, if your dad loses $30 million of your inheritance, you'd be crying, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Bradley says -- you know, he's trying to liven up his campaign. He's bringing in a '60s rock group. I think it's Gerry and the Pacemakers, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And John McCain continues to make quite an impact on voters. He's riding around on this bus. He's got this bus he calls the 'Straight-Talk Express.' This is not new. He got that idea from Clinton. Remember Clinton's bus? The 'Double-Talk Express.' Don't confuse this with George W. Bush's bus, the 'Marakesh Express.' That's a totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a great story in the new issue of People magazine. Maybe you saw this. It's about this doorman in New York's Plaza Hotel, retiring after 53 years on the job. He said in the article, he's met Presidents from Eisenhower to Reagan, but he says he's never met Bill Clinton. Duh! I'm sure he's met him. . Clinton never checked in under his own name, you know. Probably knows him as Mr. Rogers or something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in New York, Hillary Clinton says she is working hard to define herself, because a lot of people are unaware of how she spent her life before she went into the White House. You know, it would be a lot easier for us to know about her past, if she didn't shred all the documents first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I've got to give the woman credit. She is really trying hard to prove she is a New Yorker. Like, just today, she got arrested for shoplifting at Bloomingdale's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Rudy Giuliani is criticizing Hillary Clinton because he claims that a song that was played at her campaign event the other day encourages masturbation. True story. That's right, and in response -- in response, Hillary said, 'You know, with a husband like mine, I need to encourage masturbation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;One of the hottest toys at this year's toy show is a doll called 'My Real Baby,' and get this, 'My Real Baby,' it can be taught to boost its vocabulary from 'goo goo' to full sentences. Sounds cool, huh? Not only that, the same technology is being developed for George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Delaware primary -- John McCain, the guy with the big mo, he did not even campaign there. He said, 'You know, any time I step in a place that small, I get flashbacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;In South Carolina, get, this, he's campaigning there trying to get the Gen-X vote and he attended a rave party. I'm not kidding, and he tried to get them. He said to the kids, 'You know, I spent half the '70s in a room doing nothing, which kind of makes me the original slacker.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It is getting nasty between him and George Bush. The other day, McCain said, 'I still have some of the fighter pilot in me.' and Bush said, 'Oh, yeah? I still have some of the out-of-control cokehead in me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Not that these are the only guys in the presidential race. There's Donald Trump. Trying to be presidential, he unveiled his health plan. . He said there are millions of children in this country without health insurance, including three of his last six girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: (On CNN's &quot;Larry King Live&quot; (2/9)) &quot;Alan Keyes said if we lose the family farm, we lose the moral cradle of America. Why? Why am I morally inferior to someone with a big garden? I am just saying, 1% of the people work a farm now, 1%. I mean, more people have plowed Courtney Love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: (On CNN's &quot;Larry King Live&quot; (2/9)) &quot;I have a big problem with (Bob Dole's) commercial for Viagra. . I think we're really lowering the bar on courage, if it's about that. . It's like, 'Take this before the gardener gets to her.' It's just -- it's a tawdry ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: (On CNN's &quot;Larry King Live&quot; (2/9)) &quot;(About) John McCain, from the Bush camp -- first they tried he's crazy! He has been to 'nam, God knows what he'll do. That didn't stick. Now, he's an insider -- yeah, that's it, he's an insider. . If not that, what is it? Oh, he plays with puppets. he goes to the movies with Peewee Herman. What are they going to say next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced he will release his memoirs in October. Good news for American readers -- Yeltsin's memoirs will be translated into English from the original 'slurred.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Steve Forbes says he is going to drop out of the race for the presidency. Forbes made the decision to abandon the run after he failed to pick up the endorsement of 'Forbes' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;At the same time, Forbes announced plans to drop out of the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential races.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Forbes says he is proud he was able to maintain his image as a weird one in a group that included a coked-up moron, a homicidal schizophrenic and an insane dwarf.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Steve Forbes has officially dropped out of the presidential race.  He said he wanted to spend more time with his servants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess he realized things weren't going well when he was at the magazine stand. He noticed John McCain was on the cover of Forbes magazine.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Forbes spent over $34 million of his own money just on this last campaign. 34 million bucks. He said he knew it was time to get out of the race when he visited a homeless shelter and ran into his family there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see him on the news making the announcement today, surrounded by his five daughters? . After the big win in New Hampshire, John McCain was on the stage, surrounded by his seven children. I saw Vice President Al Gore, he had his three daughters. In fact, the other day on the news, they showed President Clinton, he was surrounded by his four daughters. Wait, he doesn't -- who could those women have been there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like John McCain's got the momentum now on the Republican side. Look, he's on the cover of three major magazines. This is unbelievable. Just this week, this is this week -- cover of Newsweek, cover of Time, cover of US News &amp; World Report. And George W. Bush made a magazine cover this week, the cover of High Times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton.offended several Irish groups. Because he said that Ireland should, 'belly up to the bar' in the peace process. . A spokesman for Ireland said that the comment was inappropriate, and he then excused himself so he could get roaring drunk and sing like a pirate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to recent polls, Hillary Clinton has not been connecting with female voters. . After hearing this, President Clinton said, 'You know I keep telling her, establish eye contact, then start gently caressing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher : &quot;Internet hackers. . It's been going on all week. . Janet Reno. said today that she was going to take action against these cyberterrorists. She said, 'It's going to be swift and severe,' as soon as she figures out a way to burn down a Web page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Steve Forbes is out of the election process. . McCain thinks he can pick up the Forbes voters because of his conservative stance on abortion and taxes. And George Bush thinks he can get the Forbes voters who still want a useless idiot son of a famous guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;(Bush is) on the attack against McCain in South Carolina. He is already calling him a liberal. . I think it is a little early for Bush to be playing the liberal card. If he plays that now against McCain, what is he going to call Al Gore, a lesbian?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore was in Los Angeles today. And Bill Clinton gave Al some advice. He said, if you're going to be in the L.A. area, be sure to visit Beverly Hills. Yes, Miss Beverly Hills, one of the finest strippers in West Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Michael Jordan has officially come out to endorse Senator Bill Bradley for president. Some of you may remember Jordan's 1996 endorsement of Bill Clinton, 'White Men Can Hump.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Jordan will appear in TV ads endorsing Bradley for president. One downside to the deal -- Jordan will appear as a baseball player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bradley isn't the only candidate being supported by pro athletes. Today George W. Bush picked up the endorsement of Daryl Strawberry and the Dallas Cowboys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Steve Forbes has dropped out of the race for the presidency.  Forbes told the CBS' 'Early Show' there was not going to be a way to win the nomination. The announcement came as a severe shock to his wife, who said her husband always finishes first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Forbes said he doesn't know yet whether he will run again for president or just fly his Learjet over a forest fire and toss $60 million out the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;His one lasting contribution to politics was the idea of a flat tax. It's a 10% surcharge added to any ticket for a movie featuring Gwyneth Paltrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;GOP candidate Alan Keyes was surprised today when several high- ranking members of his staff quit to work on the campaign of a snowball running for president of hell. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We had fun with Al Gore when he was here last night. You know, he said he had good time. He said he felt like he was back in college. Especially when he walked into the band's dressing room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After Hillary Clinton was treated to a free breakfast by the owner of the diner.she stiffed the waitress. See that in the paper today? Which is kind of a shock. Because usually it's Bill who's stiffing the waitress.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the company that insures the TV show 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' -- you hear about this? They're suing to get let out of their contract because they say the questions are too easy and they're paying out too much in prize money. That's what they said. They said the show is so easy, they said even George W. Bush could win as much as $200.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Dan Quayle -- we all remember Dan Quayle -- attended the 80th birthday party for Reverend Sun Myung Moon. That's right. Yeah, Quayle went for a reason. Quayle attended as a representative of the US and because he heard there was going to be a pony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day, hotel guests at the New York Sheraton were surprised. They were shocked when Al Gore came into the hotel's gym and ran on a treadmill. He just started running on the treadmill. They were really surprised. Guests said the main reason they were surprised is because they didn't know Gore's legs could move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier this week, Hillary Clinton had breakfast at a diner in Upstate New York, and she didn't give the waitress a tip. Which isn't exactly true, because she did tell the waitress to 'Stay away from my husband. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Hillary Clinton finally announced her candidacy for the US Senate this week, raising doubts if she will be able to do her duties in the White House. Aides say it will not affect her main duty being the First Lady: looking the other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;While waiting for his wife's announcement rally to begin, President Clinton ducked into a local Starbucks, where 29-year-old Jennifer Cook offered the President a massage. Clinton responded to the offer by turning to his daughter and asking, 'Shouldn't you be helping your mom?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;The centerpiece of Hillary's announcement was where she bragged, 'I make a mean toss salad.' You know she's definitely new to New York if she doesn't know what tossed salad means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;The Republican Presidential race got personal this week as George W. Bush, in an effort to portray John McCain as a Washington insider, began referring to his opponent as 'Chairman McCain.' In response, McCain, now trying to paint Bush as an simpleton who owes all his success to his father, has started calling the Texas Governor 'Tori Spelling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;And publisher Steve Forbes dropped out of the Republican race Thursday, after a poor showing in the Delaware primary. They speculate it will boost Bush's campaign since Forbes was splitting the important spoiled rich kid vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;A small bomb exploded in the heart of Wall Street before daybreak Friday. A small bomb -- or, as the IRA calls it -- an 'initial public offering.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: And President Clinton this week upset Irish advocates by urging the participants in the stalled Northern Irish Peace process to 'Belly up to the bar.' Clinton then insulted Israelis while trying to explain his Middle East peace plan when he offered, 'Have I got a deal for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Governor Jesse Ventura announced today he was severing his ties from the Reform Party. Ventura's defection is expected to leave the Reform Party in total disarray. In other words, it hasn't changed a thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They showed President Clinton on the news tonight. . He got roses and candy and a beautiful Valentine card that was signed from 'the woman who has shared your life and your love for the past 20 years.' Clinton said, 'I have no idea who this is from.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Donald Trump announced he is dropping out of the presidential race. . What a grueling two weeks that was, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;(Trump) said because it was Valentine's Day, he dropped out because he wanted to be able to spend more time with himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Trump said he will continue his work with undernourished youngsters, or as he called it: 'dating supermodels.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura says he's leaving the Reform Party. . He said, 'It's full of phonies.' Well, how bad is that when someone involved in professional wrestling thinks you're a phony?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator John McCain.pledged not to indulge in any negative campaigning. . Don't you love the negative campaigning? . I love it when the candidates call each other liars and cheats, because that's the only time they're telling the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I saw a good campaign picture of Bill Bradley today. The bad news: it is on the side of a milk carton. What happened to him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the New York Senate race, Hillary Clinton has come out for the death penalty. She is for the death penalty, but only in cases of adultery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush, trying to appeal to the religious conservatives down there, has been invoking a lot of Bible imagery. . He said, 'Jesus also had 20 missing years and never held a job he couldn't get through his dad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Donald Trump.is not going to run for president. He said he realized it wasn't for him when he went to one of those town hall meetings and they didn't even have a VIP room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Clinton caused a buzz in the quiet town of Albion, New York, over the weekend when she ate breakfast at a coffee shop and she stiffed the waitress, no tip. This is interesting. Simultaneously, back in Washington, the President also stiffed a waitress and a hostess at the same time that Hillary was in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Donald Trump announced that he is ending his run for the presidency. Trump's unwillingness to go into politics proves what I've always said -- sleaze and scum don't mix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Donald says he plans to return to his old job of growing eyebrows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;To put this in perspective, Jesse Ventura's departure last week has cut the Reform Party's number of dangerous, unqualified kooks by almost 50%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Authorities investigating Haitian drug trafficking have seized nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine in four ships docked along the Miami River. . In a completely unrelated story, the George W. Bush Valentine's Day party was cancelled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;American Beauty, eight (Oscar) nominations. . It's the story of a husband who lusts after a teenage girl, while his cold wife puts together bad real estate deals. In fact, today, President Clinton called it his favorite film of the year. But he thought it was a documentary.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, Jerry Lewis stunned the crowd. . He said, 'You use women as just baby-producing machines.' . In fact, his thinking was so irrational, was so bizarre, that today he was named Reform Party candidate for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Bill Bradley spoke at the Sierra Club headquarters up there in San Francisco. He talked about the latest name on the endangered species list -- his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Donald Trump has dropped out. He's not going to run for president. He says he wants to spend some more time with his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman was married in Washington. President Clinton attended the wedding ceremony. Boy, that's got to be the groom's worst nightmare, don't you think, huh? Watching Bill Clinton lining up to kiss your bride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview on CNN, President Clinton said one of the toughest things about Hillary's campaign for the New York Senate is having to listen to people criticize her. He said people lying about his wife drives him nuts. That's what he said. Which is kind of odd. Apparently, lying to his wife, he doesn't see anything wrong with that. Lying about her, that's much worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Republicans had a big debate there in South Carolina tonight. . Bush and McCain and Alan Keyes.are very angry at each other, but they had to agree that America is basically peaceful, happy and prosperous right now. What they disagreed on was who is to blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;(Clinton) was online the other day with CNN and hackers broke in and made it sound like he had written, 'I'd like to see more porn on the internet.' . And he was not amused. He got up from the computer and he said to one of his aides, 'Get my pants, we are leaving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Elian Gonzalez's father wrote a letter yesterday to Janet Reno demanding that he be returned to Cuba. And Janet Reno was so touched, not by the letter, just that a man sent her a note on Valentine's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Harry Browne, who ran for president in 1996 on the Libertarian ticket, is once again seeking the nomination of his party. The Libertarians will choose their candidate in July at their convention in a McDonald's restroom in Anaheim.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Last night was the last debate down there in South Carolina. . Why were the candidates sitting so close together? It looked like some bad Delta flight, fighting over the armrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All the reporters saying that Bush is looking tougher and more presidential in the debates. Still, doesn't Bush remind you of the guy in college who's always collecting money for the beer run? 'I'm going to Piggly- Wiggly, come on! Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush said last night that even though President Clinton is popular, you don't see many mothers and fathers naming their children Bill Clinton. Well, sure, that's because they're still waiting for the DNA tests to come back.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, both McCain and Bush are trying to say the other guy is more like Clinton. They're each accusing each other of being more like Clinton. You know what we should do? Bring in Monica Lewinsky. Have a blind taste test, like the Pepsi Challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, in Brooklyn, Bill Bradley met with doctors to discuss health care. . He's talking about health care. Then he leaves the doctors, and eats a big piece of cheesecake. . A candidate with a heart condition eating cheesecake. Why don't you have some fries and shovel snow for an hour, too, while you're out there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Bradley is now accusing Al Gore of using unfair tactics to win over gay voters. . I think he's right, because today, Gore announced that his running mate would be either Seigfried or Roy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Drug Czar.said (Colombia's) cocaine production is twice what we thought it was. He said they're producing 520 tons of cocaine a year. . George Bush commented on this. He said, 'That is enough to give every man, woman and child in America an embarrassing drug history that they are unwilling to talk about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush is sort of changing his stripes. First, he was a compassionate conservative. Now, he's stealing McCain's issues. He's a reformer with results. . Among his results and his reforms: voluntary pollution control, which has given Houston the worst air quality in America. although that gives him a great Clinton-style campaign line, 'I couldn't inhale.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Alan Keyes.said, 'The party is not doing enough to reach out to the Republican black voter,' until someone pointed out he is the Republican black voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Our top story -- the Best in Show prize was awarded at the Westminster Dog Show today. . Contrary to what you might be expecting, there will be no cheap jokes about Linda Tripp in our dog show coverage tonight. We are simply not that cruel. Besides, Ms.Tripp didn't even attend the dog show. She was too busy competing in the national hog and livestock show.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all see President Clinton's press conference yesterday? He came out in support of Al Gore, which is not surprising. . He told reporters that Al Gore has always been brutally honest. But you know, to Bill Clinton, any kind of honesty is brutal, isn't it, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He also told reporters he was very troubled by the rising cost of home- heating oil. Then he went on to say, even more troubled by the rising cost of scented massage oil.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch that nasty, contentious Republican debate in South Carolina the other night? . They kept shouting each other down, interrupting each other. In fact, George W. Bush said, 'Please, let me finish, ' more times than a Bill Clinton mistress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Bush is getting a lot of criticism over all the death row inmates the state of Texas has executed. . He is the compassionate conservative. Like he said today, Texas is replacing the old electric chair with a new electric chair that has a lumbar support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The producer of 'Baywatch, Hawaii,' said that unless the state of Hawaii can pay $2.5 million in production costs, the show will have to be canceled. As a result, today Hawaii was granted federal emergency relief by President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senator John McCain.received the endorsement of former presidential candidate Gary Bauer. After hearing about it, McCain said, 'Well, that's nice. But who's Gary Bauer?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Down there in South Carolina, the primary is Saturday, the Republicans, Bush and McCain. And it's gotten so nasty -- get this -- the latest is Bush's allies -- I don't know who these people are -- are putting out a magazine accusing John McCain of being a Marxist who doesn't particularly care that his wife was a drug addict. . They also say, in 1988 he and hippie friends broke into the White House and gave Reagan Alzheimer's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush is getting desperate because he's running out of all that big money he had. And McCain, who doesn't have nearly as much money, is at least even with him. And McCain was bragging about this. He said his campaign, 'was a seminal event in American politics.' Clinton said, 'Look, if anyone's responsible for a seminal event.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The President had a press conference the other day. . He said that the race is shaping up to be one where they are so consumed with character, they are ill-prepared to debate the issues. The head of the Republican National Committee sort of took Bush and McCain to task. . He said, 'How long has it been since either of you guys has accused a fictional character of being gay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Westchester County, New York, residents are hopping mad about a leak at a Hudson Bay power plant -- the most serious release of pollution in the area since the Clintons moved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;C-SPAN has a new show with President Clinton - 'Who Wants to be First Lady for a Night?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton and Al Gore are going to make a joint campaign appearance. . They're going to speak for the first time at a church. Supposedly, both Hillary and Gore are going to speak about their common ground. I guess their common ground is the fact that Bill doesn't spend much time with either one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton has promised to go back to the diner where she stiffed the waitress.and vowed to leave a tip. Although, the waitress said President Clinton already came by and took care of it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow, the big primary in South Carolina -- Bush versus McCain. 'The Thriller in Vanilla,' ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Alan Keyes is in this. . He's a black guy running a state with the Confederate flag on the top of the capitol. Good luck. Let me know how you make out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush's wife Laura was asked if she thought her husband had peaked too soon. Now, you see, that goes over the line. What happens between two married people in the privacy of their bedroom is their own business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush is.calling himself a compassionate conservative. See, I don't understand what the compassionate part is exactly. I mean, he's fried so many prisoners in Texas, instead of Governor, they should be calling him the Colonel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A woman is going to be executed. And I tell you, those compassionate Republicans, they are very conservative when it comes to women, and they are tough on the women. Not only do they execute them, but they make them cook their own last meal, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But in his speech today in Michigan -- George W. Bush said he smelled victory, which is pretty good, considering how much damage his nasal passages have had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, you watch McCain, you watch Bush -- they keep attacking each other, these vicious attacks. why? Remember the old days of the Republican party, when they were all united against the poor and minorities? What happened there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton has called and apologized to the upstate New York waitress that she didn't tip the other day. . President Clinton called the waitress, too, and asked what she was wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Are you all going to get to South Carolina tomorrow and vote tomorrow? . Apparently, anyone can just go there and vote. So feel free. We have a bus waiting outside, to really screw things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to the Washington Post, this Valentine's Day, John McCain gave his wife two dozen roses, but George W. Bush didn't give his wife anything. And in a related story, earlier today, Bush's wife endorsed John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During a radio interview yesterday, George W. Bush said he would not -- he would not appoint an openly gay person to his administration. . George W. went on to say, 'All my appointees will be repressed homosexuals or closet cases.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;On Saturday, South Carolina voters go to the polls for the pivotal South Carolina primary. George W. Bush leading with voters who don't give a damn, John McCain with voters who don't give a crap and Keyes with voters who don't give a rat's ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a welcome attempt to get away from recent negative campaigning, Senator McCain said his opponent Governor Bush was among the party's most respected spoiled rich-kid coke fiends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, all the candidates agree on one thing -- after tomorrow's primaries they'll never think of South Carolina again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Iran held elections today and early indications are that reformers are edging out hard-line conservatives. Could be the end of a reign of terror and the start of a milder mist of terror. Women may be allowed to remove their veils for 10 seconds every week to brush teeth and shave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;George W. Bush got his campaign back on track with a victory over Senator John McCain in today's South Carolina primary. Bush garnered 54% of the vote, prompting the ecstatic Texas Governor to declare, 'I haven't gotten grades this good since Yale.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;After his victory party earlier tonight, a jubilant Bush shouted to his supporters, 'Now it's on to Michigan,' then hopped into a car and drove into the ocean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn : &quot;Political insiders believe George W. Bush's primary victory today could set the tone for the campaign, since South Carolina is always a good indication as to how the rest of the country will vote in 1850.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Bush attributed his win today to voters believing in his promise to put an end to Clinton-era mistrust and create a White House free of scandal and sex. 'After all,' remarked Bush, 'I feel pretty weird doing it on my mother's bed anyway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Bush admitted that he has spent $50 million so far, the most money ever spent on a GOP nomination, and has already begun pleading for more, prompting potential GOP contributors to ask, 'Exactly how much does it cost to fool the American public?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he will not vie for the Reform Party presidential nomination has left the remaining candidates scrambling for the all-important 'elderly casino slot machine addict' vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;On Monday, Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Bill Bradley will meet for a crucial debate in Harlem. One of the top issues to be covered -- which one of them is whiter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Earlier this week tempers flared between Bush and McCain as the Texas Governor lashed out at his opponent for comparing him to President Clinton. Bush angrily said he is nothing like Clinton, because although they were both southern governors and avoided service in Vietnam, Bush never once smoked pot without inhaling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This is President's Day. And they rated them today. . (Clinton) came in the poll of historians dead last in the morality category because, I guess, Monica Lewinsky. But you know, he was not the only president with a mistress. His problem is that he just had sex with his mistress. He would have done better if he owned her like Jefferson. Or killed her like Kennedy&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Al Gore and Bill Bradley had their debate tonight at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Unbelievable. Two white guys on the stage at the Apollo Theater pandering for the black vote. Bradley, first of all, promised to have Lil' Kim declared as a protective wet land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Then Gore claimed that his sister died from not washing her ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did You see Al Gore and Bill Bradley debate at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem last night? . I don't want to say Gore was stiff, but for a second there, I thought he was the wooden log that performers rub their hands on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Gore trying to be hip? . He kept saying, 'What you talkin' about, Willis?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bradley said he would consider naming a minority as his running mate. Gee, what a coincidence he would wait until he was at the Apollo to say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Minor setback for Al Gore today. . I guess as Al Gore was walking the streets of New York early this morning, they found him three hours later in Queens, up on blocks, all of his mechanical parts stripped off. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess those two love birds (from 'Who Wants to Mary A Multi- Millionaire') are having some problems. . The paper today called it 'America's phoniest sham marriage.' Well, I bet the Clintons are happy to lose that title, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A panel of historians.has actually rated the presidents. . And President Clinton came in last in the category of moral authority. . And in response, the President said, 'That's true, but I came in first in most booty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's the Michigan primary. . It's so close, Bush is predicting that he will win by a nose or what's left of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Yesterday, Bush was at a grade school. It was Presidents Day and the little kids were dressed as presidents. Some of them are very realistic. The little kid who was dressed as George Bush Sr. threw up during lunch. And the little kid who was dressed as Clinton had an accident in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The President.said today he is going to visit India. . You know, he's very popular in India, Clinton is. Because over there Monica Lewinsky is considered sacred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gore and Bradley were at the Apollo last night in Harlem at their debate. . The crowd was crazy, and it included Whoopi Goldberg, who was a Gore supporter, and Spike Lee, who was a Bradley supporter, and Johnnie Cochran, who was just there in case Bradley and Gore killed each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;According to a new survey by historians, Abe Lincoln ranks as America's best president. . Bill Clinton ranked smack dab in the middle. Which would have been OK if he hadn't started yelling 'President sandwich, President sandwich!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Results indicate Senator John McCain is the winner over George W. Bush (in Michigan). The Texas Governor isn't giving up just yet. He's hoping a late turnout will help him win by a nostril.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Asked for a comment on the Michigan results, McCain said, 'I'd have to be crazy to quit the race right now,' and then promptly quit the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night, Al Gore and Bill Bradley held a debate at Harlem's historic Apollo Theater. Al Gore made a huge error in judgment when he threatened to pop a cap in his opponent's buttocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see this on the news tonight? Yet another Texan on death row - - George W. Bush, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator John McCain won two primaries yesterday, beating Bush -- beating Bush handily. Yeah, it's a fascinating story, this John McCain guy. He spent 5 1/2 years in prison. Now he's running for President. Talk about doing things backwards.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't want to say Bush did poorly in Michigan, but he finished 12 points behind Rick Rockwell, the 'Millionaire guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some sad news -- Darryl Strawberry once again testing positive for cocaine. But in his defense, he said all he did was shake hands with George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky was on Barbara Walter's show, 'The View,' the other day, talking about how she has a new website, which I think is great. You can sit at your desk and access Monica, just like Clinton used to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see her on 'The View?' She was showing off her line of handbags. Apparently, she makes handbags now. And you can tell a Monica handbag. See, they don't have straps, they just have two ears on the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Senator John McCain won the Michigan and Arizona primaries yesterday.with help from his new campaign slogan - 'Give government back to the people.' That's a nice slogan, isn't it? That was his slogan. That's right. Yeah. George W. Bush has had less success with his new campaign slogan - 'Vote for me or I'll tell my dad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that Donald Trump doesn't like George W. Bush because he's 'a lightweight with no brain.' That's what he said. Apparently, those qualities are only appealing to Trump when he's looking for a girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;White people Al Gore and Bill Bradley took.a police-escorted limousine to Harlem for an important face-off at the historic Apollo Theater. The two candidates met in a 90 minute debate on urban and racial issues, followed by 15 minutes of 'snaps.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;The hysterical mishaps started early when Bradley came on stage and, in a long Apollo tradition, rubbed Gore for good luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;The always-outspoken Rev. Al Sharpton called the nationally- televised forum 'the demarginalization for our concerns as a community.' As usual, nobody knew what he meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you all by now have heard and seen on TV all the reports about that so-called millionaire? You know, the guy that's not quite what he's cracked up to be. But enough about George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More than 200 truckers drove into Washington.to protest the high cost of diesel fuel. To his credit, President Clinton actually went down and talked to the truckers. Not about fuel prices -- he wanted to find out where they got those cool nude silhouette mud flaps.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night at the White House, the Queen of Spain slipped on a set of stairs while greeting President Clinton. . The President said he was surprised she fell, because he hardly even goosed her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Republicans are jumping ship from the Bush camp. . Bush didn't do well in the primaries the other day. And so the Secretary of State out here in California, the Mayor of San Diego, Bill Bennett, they're all going over to McCain. And Bush is no stranger to this kind of abandonment, I have to tell you. The same thing used to happen to him when he ran out of blow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Secret Service is being sued by former black agents who claim there is racial bias in the way promotions are dolled out there. Clinton's own lead agent used to be a black guy, which explains why he wound up with a chick with a big ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: (Sen, John McCain said:) '&quot;I will beat Al Gore like a drum.' To which, an angry Al Gore responded, 'Oh yeah? Well, I will blow John McCain like a clarinet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Concerning the set-backs (in Arizona and Michigan) George W. Bush said, 'This is a marathon and I'm going to be in it to the end.' Although he lost the crowd when he added, 'And come next November 7, I'm going to vomit on the curb and wear a little silver blanket.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Governor George W. Bush failed to give a reprieve to that 62-year-old Texas woman who was put to death last night by lethal injection. I don't think she did herself any favors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you hear what her last words to Bush were? 'I'm voting for McCain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President George Bush, doing much better. . I guess his heartbeat skipped a thing there. Yeah, he must have seen his son's latest poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see the 'multi-millionaire' bride talk with Diane Sawyer last night on '20/20'? . I guess she gave a lot of details about the honeymoon. Apparently, they stayed in separate rooms. They didn't have sex. They didn't even talk, or as the Clintons call it, Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard by now, New York Yankee Darryl Strawberry tested positive for cocaine again. Third time. . Hillary Clinton is more likely to wear a Yankee hat this year than he his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Bob Dole warned the Republican presidential candidates to stop negative campaigning before irreparable damage is done. . Dole said if you're not careful, you can end up losing the respect of your party and doing Viagra commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;President Clinton had to be evacuated from a hotel today when a fire alarm went off. They had to get him out of there right away. Apparently, as soon as he heard the alarm, the President put his pants on and left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former President George Bush was rushed to a local hospital after suffering a dangerous heart palpitation. Former first lady Barbara Bush said it occurred while her husband was watching the Grammys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A guy was trying to sell his soul on the Internet. . They told him he can't sell his soul on the website. They said, 'If you want to sell your soul, hey, run for president, like everybody else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President George Bush doing better. . He said he felt dizzy, felt lightheaded, felt nauseous. He had a hard time breathing. The same way his son feels whenever you ask him a question about foreign policy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To his credit today, George W. Bush finally said he regrets not speaking out against the racial and religious intolerance associated with Bob Jones University. . I think their motto is, 'Preparing students for the 14th century.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Bradley. dropped off the radar screen. He's so desperate, now, he's thinking of marrying Rick Rockwell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new poll, 32% of Americans say that John McCain is the candidate they most trust to baby-sit their 16-year-old daughter. I guess they think with McCain's combat experience, he could fight off Clinton until help arrives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last Friday, in Washington, President Clinton was evacuated from an awards ceremony where he was giving a speech. He was at the Marriott Hotel, fire broke out at the hotel. . According to the fire marshal, what happened was apparently a spark from Clinton's zipper ignited -- there were some papers on the podium, and apparently it made the jump. Boom, the whole thing went up. They said it was the first time Clinton's ever run out of a hotel without his pants down at his ankles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems the biggest contributors to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign in New York are lawyers and Disney. . That means, if you're backing Hillary, you're either crooked or Goofy, one or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Just down the street from the house President Clinton recently bought in New York, they're building a Dunkin' Donuts.which means now all the neighborhood has to do is build a Hooters, and we're all set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has a new campaign slogan. It's 'A reformer with results.' . I think it's better than his old campaign slogan: 'A dumb guy with connections.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush had a full weekend. He spent the entire weekend apologizing for his appearance at Bob Jones University. . B.J.U., wait a minute. That's where Monica Lewinsky went to school, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;John McCain took on the religious right today. . He gave them what for in their home state in Virginia. . And of course, they fired back.. And the only way they know how is insinuating someone was gay. Pat Robertson said that don't forget during the war, McCain was 'held by Charlie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George W. Bush had to apologize for what he did at Bob Jones University. . He said he regretted going there and not speaking out against religious intolerance. I think his drug past came back because he said, 'We shouldn't have lines that divide people. We should have people dividing up lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore is campaigning now to make medical marijuana legal and to also improve medical treatment for the elderly. In order to do this, Al Gore is encouraging the development of the first Craftmatic Adjustable Bong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Bush was released with his irregular heartbeat under control. The stay is going to cost him thousands and thousands of dollars. It would have been less except when he was President, Bush cut Medicare benefits to the elderly in half.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;George W. Bush offered an apology to Cardinal John O'Connor and Catholics in general, after coming under fire for visiting South Carolina's Bob Jones University; also known as the Harvard of the 1600s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Bush's relentless pandering to American Samoa has paid off as he scored primary victories there, as well as in Guam, the Virgin islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These island wins would give Bush much-needed momentum if the next primary was to be held in Brigadoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Bush trounced McCain 93% to 6% in Puerto Rico largely because of his pro-Puerto Rican statehood stance, which is in line with that Island's Republicans., while Democrats tend to favor either the status quo or independence. It is a divisive issues, and one that can only be ultimately solved by parades.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess gas is at an all-time high. It's the highest it's ever been, at least that's what they're telling Bill Bradley as to why there is only two cars in his motorcade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bill Bradley, it doesn't look good for him. Last week, he concentrated a lot of his efforts in Washington State, which is what they call a 'non- binding primary.' They often call that a beauty contest which is -- you know, it's too bad it's not like a real beauty contest. Because if you notice, we do things backwards in this country. Did you ever notice how in political contests, candidates wave, they ride in parades, they cut ribbons. In a beauty contest, what do you ask the contestants? 'How do you feel about world peace? What is your plan?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush continues come under fire for speaking out at the Bob Jones University. I've been reading more and more about this -- very conservative school. Like, do you know, apparently, men and women aren't allowed to have any kind of sexual contact while they're going to this school.  No sexual contact at all, which sounds like the school I went to, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: John McCain keeps referring to himself as a 'Reagan Republican.' And this is driving George W. Bush nuts, because he keeps going, 'Who's this Reagan guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And John McCain got some good news today. He was endorsed by Kathleen Willey, remember her, the White House worker President Clinton allegedly groped in the Oval Office? This is true, she came out for McCain. And you realize, if McCain can get only half the women hit on by Clinton, he'll win by a landslide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to an article in the New York Post, Monica Lewinsky -- she is talking about Bill Clinton again. She now says that he thought she was beautiful, the things she liked about Clinton. Clinton thought that she was beautiful and sexy no matter what size she was. But she was also very concerned about her weight. Like when she was with the President, she would often ask him, 'Does this desk make my ass look big?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm worried because we have George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, and early on in the campaign I said, &quot;This guy, to me, looks like he could be a colossal boob.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So the thing I will remind the Governor of, when we get him on the satellite there from wherever he is out on the campaign trail, is that the road to the White House runs through me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There for awhile it looked like he was down and out because he really upset the Catholics, you know? And I'm saying, you know, if you want to go after somebody, go after the Presbyterians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Today, McCain called Bush to congratulate Bush on his victory, and during the conversation, McCain said, 'I think I have a bad connection,' and Bush said, 'Try my guy. His stuff is primo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush is back ahead in the delegate count. I think it came out the other day, because he said, 'Boy, it's good to be out from behind the three and a half grams -- I mean the eight ball.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gore and Bradley tonight had their debate here in California. Wow! It was on CNN. It was on C-Span and it was on Fox under the title, 'Who Wants to Marry a Monotone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I tell you, Gore really knows how to play Los Angeles. You know, he knew exactly how to get the L.A. crowd, and just show them that he is more powerful than Bradley because during the debate, his cell phone rang, and he went, 'I got to take this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Senator John McCain suffered a major setback in his presidential bid yesterday when he lost the primaries to George W. Bush. Three losses came on the heels of a tactical blunder by McCain who announced his new running mate: Kathie Lee Gifford.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senator John McCain was here last night. He was here last night. And after the taping, he went down to speak in Little Saigon. In fact, I understand they're still holding him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Woo, scary couple of moments in LA International Airport. Did you hear about this? Boy, there's always something in this town. I guess air traffic controllers said they saw something just disappear off the radar screen. Turns out it was just Bill Bradley's campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard Bradley's campaign is not doing well. In fact, today his campaign bus was pulled over for driving in the carpool lane with not enough people in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The man can't get a break. You know who was driving the bus? Halle Berry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, Al Gore and Bill Bradley debated. And I think Bradley -- you know, he's a nice man, but he's really getting desperate now for attention. You see what he wore? He had on the Jennifer Lopez dress. Did you see that thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, the Democratic debates were so boring last night, people actually switched back to watch '10th Kingdom' on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, President Clinton certified the nation of Colombia as our partner in the war on drugs. Whose idea was that? . Are they really going to be a help, Colombia, on the war on drugs? Isn't that like naming Great Britain as our partner in the war on tooth decay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Two astronauts allegedly had sex in the space capsule with the full endorsement of the NASA space agency. That's what they are saying. People are upset about this. Do you think that's so bad? I don't think that's so bad. You know, I think Clinton should try that. No, think about it. I mean, in space all his girlfriends would be weightless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, Jesse Jackson said that although he likes Bill Bradley, he's decided to endorse Al Gore. That's what he said. Big announcement. Yeah, Jackson said it was a very difficult decision, but there are a lot more words that rhyme with 'Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some gruesome news. Another execution scheduled for this Tuesday. But enough about the Bill Bradley campaign. Move on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Bill Bradley hanged out at a gas station today, not even to get gas. He just wanted to see some numbers that were going up for a change.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that great picture of Al Gore and his daughter jogging on the beach in Santa Monica? It made history. It said it was the first time a 52-year-old guy in LA was seen with a girl young enough to be his daughter who really was his daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republican candidate Alan Keyes today came out today in favor of human cloning research. He feels with cloning, he could possibly get two supporters now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know 'The Star.' They check, recheck, and then check the facts again. Hillary Clinton, allegedly, has been taking dialect lessons to sound more like a New Yorker. That's what they said. I think she's always sounded like a New Yorker, you know? Every time she gets subpoenaed or asked a question, she goes, 'I don't know nothing. Hey, I didn't see nothing. Hey, shut up. I don't know what you're talking about.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Monica Lewinsky said.that President Clinton is so charismatic, that after being alone with him for five minutes, any woman would have done what she did. That's what she said, which explains why today President Clinton scheduled a four-minute meeting with Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know what I took away from that little chat with George W.? Don't you think? A very confident guy. In fact, this weekend, he's going to ask his father to help him bungle his choice for vice-president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bill Bradley has a new campaign slogan. 'Give him the ball.' Boy, you know, that's silly. You don't want to really, give the ball to the white guy, do you? No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman : &quot;Hillary Clinton, she'll be marching in the gay-lesbian Irish parade, and I think she just wants to spend some time with people who have not had sex with her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton has certified the nation of Colombia as our partner in the war on drugs. Once again, that goes to prove Clinton will pick anyone as a partner. Doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn. &quot;Presidential candidate Bill Bradley purchased 4 1/2 minutes of air time on CBS last night in last-ditch effort to win votes. Bradley says if this latest stunt doesn't spark a fire, he has one idea. Next week he's going to marry some billionaire low-life on Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's how stiff this guy is. (Gore) is campaigning in New York. He went up to Grant's tomb, and they wouldn't let him out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush.came to New York and said, 'I can smell victory.' . Let me tell you something. I've lived in this city 20 years, and what your smelling isn't victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Signs Your Campaign Is Doomed: 10. Campaign bus adorned with catchy slogan 'Greyhound.' 9. Your staffers already refer to day after 'Super Tuesday' as 'Crushing Depression Wednesday.' 8. Your name: Michael W. Dukakis. 7. John Rocker won't shut up about how great you are. 6. You ask your wife who she voted for; she says, 'That's personal.' 5. You own one suit, and it's starting to get ripe. 4. You've done the bulk of your campaigning in Mexico. 3. Only 'celebrity' supporting you is guy who sort of looks like Roy Scheider. 2. When McCain mentions years in Vietnamese prison, you brag: 'In junior high I was, like, always getting detention.' 1. Voters refer to you as 'The dork in the pirate outfit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush and John McCain appeared on the Letterman and Leno shows respectively.presumably to promote their new show on the WB.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Bush's Letterman appearance was quickly hailed as 'a train wreck the likes of which the American public has not seen since 'The Fugitive. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Bush's aides assured the Governor that he killed and when the audience groans it is a sign you are getting through to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;Meanwhile, McCain showed up on the Tonight show and while he did not appear presidential, he was a solid second guest -- Neve Campbell follows no one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart: &quot;McCain's impression of Leno brought the house down. And by down I mean it made everyone kind of glum.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Arizona Democrats became the first voters in the nation to vote over the Internet in a legally binding election. This is true. So far, Al Gore I guess has gotten 43% of the internet vote. Bill Bradley, 34%, and 22% voted for the naked Alyssa Milano.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John McCain told a group of his supporters today, 'I feel a surge coming on.' The last time we heard that in Washington I believe Monica's dress got ruined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the polls, they said Bradley does great with Democrats who make over $100,000 a year. Do you know what you call Democrats who make over $100,000 a year? Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems Miss Northeast Arkansas was arrested for drunk driving on her way home from giving a speech about the dangers of drunk driving. . You've got a beauty queen from Arkansas with a drinking problem. Boy, this has Clinton girlfriend written all of over it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bill Bradley, probably not all that happy. . He lost all the states. Didn't even win his home state.and the kid from 'The sixth sense' is suddenly able to see him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;You have to give Bradley credit. He did run a dignified campaign, and I'm sure that the Doritos commercial he's filming tomorrow will be just as dignified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;A good day for George Bush. He did very well. It looks like it may be over with that campaign as well. . Bush said the battle with McCain has made him a better candidate. He said it proves he has 'inner strength.' He's not just talking about his liver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Today is Super Tuesday, the day people who live outside New York and California realize how unimportant they really are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn : &quot;Bill Bradley will be celebrating drunk, locked in a hotel room, 'Drunk- off-his-ass Wednesday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Rodham was in New York to lend her support to Al Gore, who immediately left a message on the first lady's answering machine saying 'not helping.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;With Dole in 1996 and McCain in 2000, America is sending a clear message to the veterans: We don't care.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Big victory for George W. Bush yesterday. . Bush was in such a good mood, he went the entire day in Texas today without executing anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He did real big here in California. They said.59% of the female Republican women went for Bush. 57% of Catholic Republicans went for Bush. And 100% of frat boys who smirks went for Bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is what they call a new Republican. That's a Republican who does not want to return to the past because he cannot remember any of it, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess it's Bush versus Gore, huh? You got Yale man versus Harvard man. . It's good to know America is a place where any preppie can grow up to be President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush and Gore. This has turned into a real polo match, hasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;McCain did not do too good. . His people are denying he would accept an offer to be vice president. Well, I can understand that -- shut up in a room with nothing to do for four years. He had enough of that as a POW, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The good news for McCain, the rabies test came back negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess we know what Bill Bradley is giving up for lent, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I felt sorry for Bradley yesterday. . He didn't win one state. Nothing. In fact, they said in the news today it was the worst performance in history by a basketball player not wearing a Clippers uniform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More bad news today for Bill Bradley. It turns out two weeks ago he bought 500 shares of Procter &amp; Gamble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that one ad where Michael Jordan was endorsing (Bradley)? And I thought, 'Hey, that was a pretty credible endorsement, Michael Jordan.' Until a few minutes later, I saw another ad where Michael was talking to Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny and all his 'Space Jam' buddies, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;California voters have banned gay marriages, and they also voted to ban anyone from marrying Rick Rockwell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;California approved Proposition 22. Now, as I understand it, this bans, in that state, gay marriages. So I'm confused, because I'm thinking, one of the advantages of being gay was you didn't have to get married.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last night I was looking at George W. Bush. . He's talking about his big victory in the Super Tuesday, and he's thanking John McCain for bringing out the best in him. . And I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, we've seen George W. Bush at his best?&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush won Super Tuesday in the three biggest states, and when I heard that I thought to myself, 'I wonder if George W. can name the three biggest states.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Headlines During A George W. Bush Presidency 10. President Streaks Supreme Court 9. President Fails In Shoe-Tying Bid 8. President To Nation: Do These Non-Prescription Eyeglasses Make Me Look Smarter? 7. Bush To Hussein: I'm Telling My Daddy On You 6.

President Trades America For 'Magic Dog'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;These people love Gore and Bush, or as I now call them -- Bore and Gush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bradley said for sure he's going to drop out tomorrow, which leads to the biggest question of the campaign -- how will we know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Arizona was the first state ever where voting occurred on the Internet. Americans for the first time were able to make important political decisions in their underwear. Just like President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, I saw Bill Bradley's new American Express commercial, 'Hi, remember me, I ran for president once.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Bradley's out. . and by all accounts, Bradley (is) truly a decent man (with) high moral character -- right there, he's wrong for the job. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;(Bradley) lost every single state to Al Gore. Every single one. Which just goes to show, charisma can only carry you so far.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;John McCain also dropped out today. I was sad to see that. You know, if we can just get Gore and Bush to drop out, we're home free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But today, both McCain and Bradley got good news -- Alan Keyes says he's considering both of them as possible running mates, should he get the nomination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore versus George Bush. . This is like class warfare -- the haves versus the really haves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is changing, not so conservative now. He's moving toward the middle. They said today he's trying to position himself as a different kind of Republican who can win in November. Just winning in November would make him a different kind of Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;(Bush is) reaching out to the center. Like today he talked about the plight of the homeless. Actually, it was the plight of the summer homeless. You know, those tragic Americans who are stuck in Connecticut on the weekends have no place to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;McCain is not going to drop out of sight. In fact, just today he signed a deal to wrestle Maria Shriver on pay-per-view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said today he wants China to have permanent most- favored nation status. Which makes sense. That's the nation that gave him the most favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bradley's speech, I felt, was especially moving today quitting the race. He said, 'You know, it's easy to look back and sww all the things you did wrong.' But he pointed out that the main thing he did wrong was probably his campaign slogan - 'Vote for Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George W. Bush already veering back toward the middle. He kind of went to the right in South Carolina to win his nomination. . When he was down in South Carolina, there at Bob Jones University.they (had) outlawed interracial dating. Since then, (the school) has sort of recanted that. they've allowed interracial dating. And (Bush) produced a letter today from one of the white students there that said, &quot;Thank you, Mr. Bush. you have improved my sex life amazingly. You truly are a reformer with results.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Pope is going to make a sweeping apology for a lot of the stuff that he says are sins over the 2,000 years of the Catholic Church. . And Bill Clinton today said this was very impressive, as the Pope was making this kind of apology considering that he doesn't even have a wife that's not speaking to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;John McCain.suspended his presidential campaign today. McCain blamed his poor showing in the primaries on bad organization and inability to make his message clear, and the fact that no one seemed to want a president who was a nasty, temperamental, moody son of a bitch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's interesting about this election? It's that Al Gore has the opposite problem that George Bush has. Like when Al Gore is asked about Chinese world leaders, he has to pretend he doesn't know their names.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore is saying that...he would like to debate George W.  Bush twice a week on television. I don't know, Al. You know, the American public really doesn't respond all that well to threats, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And Bush, he's not dumb. He says he's going to attack Al Gore with all the Clinton scandals. . And I'm thinking, well, now, how will that hurt Al Gore? I mean, the Clinton scandals didn't even hurt Clinton, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After a string of losses on Super Tuesday, John McCain announced he's dropping out of the presidential race and a spokesman for John McCain said, 'Hey, anybody looking for a good spokesman?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Asked if he would consider a spot as vice president on a Bush-McCain ticket, McCain grabbed the microphone, cracked the reporter over the head and kicked him repeatedly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, gas got expensive this week, didn't it? . In fact, gas is so expensive -- listen to this -- guys now are actually dating Monica Lewinsky just for her siphoning skills.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kind of embarrassing moment for Al Gore this past weekend. I guess he and Tipper were at home, you know, in Washington. They sent out for Chinese takeout. The restaurant sent over $2 million in cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview today with the New York Times, Al Gore says he's going to make campaign finance reform a cornerstone, a cornerstone of his campaign. And he also said anybody could have their name engraved on the cornerstone for a simple donation of $10,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So it's going to be George W. Bush versus Al Gore. Yeah, kind of like Tylenol P.M. versus NyQuil, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I haven't seen a contest this exciting, well, since that guy shampooed half his head with Tegrin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now with John McCain out of the race, George W. Bush has to pick a running mate, which is kind of a scary proposition when you think about it. I mean, his dad picked Dan Quayle, and he isn't as smart as his dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see that heated exchange on the ABC Sunday morning show between Bill Clinton and the Vice President of the NRA? . They were kind of going at it -- which is kind of ironic. When you think about it, Clinton is the one who looks like he has a gun in his pocket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Pope, has apologized for past wrongdoings over the last 2, 000 years. And not to be outdone, today the Baptists apologized for President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The United States and Great Britain now plan to share genetic data in the future. This is part of a plan to mix the genes of an English man with the genes of Bill Clinton, to create a man with a normal sex drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This whole Filegate thing that's been going on for a while. President Clinton said the White House getting FBI files on Republicans was a completely honest mistake. . Wouldn't you know it, the first completely honest thing Clinton has done, and it was a mistake.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How about Clinton taking on the National Rifle Association? You gotta admit, Clinton is a man of conviction. You know, he once left the country for four years to avoid carrying a rifle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview with a New York hip-hop radio station, Senate candidate Hillary Clinton.said Motown is her era and those are her people. Only someone from Arkansas would run for the Senate in New York and claim their people are from Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush said that he will debate Al Gore when people are paying attention. Let me tell you something, if people were paying attention, George W. Bush wouldn't be a candidate, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gore e-mailed Bush, and then Bush tried to e-mail him back, but he couldn't get the stamps to stick to the screen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They say now, this election is going to be decided by the female vote. That's what they're saying. . So they're both pandering, of course -- because they're panderers -- to the women. Bush has hinted he wants a female running mate. Gore talks about women's health issues. And both say they want to see more of Katie Couric's colon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The 2000 Census.came the other day. The Census forms have arrived. They say the average household will take 38 minutes to complete the census and another five seconds to chuck it in the garbage after you realize that you are sending President Clinton your daughter's phone number.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hillary Clinton did a big interview with a New York hip-hop radio station. Many did not know it was Hillary, because she used her rap name, Queen Subpoena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Hillary said if you vote for her, you'll also get her husband, Notorious DNA.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;She said she's running for Senate to forget about Monica Lewinsky, also known as MC Hummer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Dan Quayle will be getting his own bust in the United States Capital. It's a big honor. The head will be 100% marble, just like Dan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A judge in Pakistan today ordered a convicted murderer to be strangled, cut into 100 pieces and then boiled in acid -- or, as they call it in Texas, a slap on the wrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was on this day in 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Spain after discovering America. . Columbus was considered a failure. Remember, he was looking for a direct route to China. He didn't find it. See, we know today that if he'd wanted a direct route to China, he should've gone through the Clinton White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Census Bureau has received hundreds of complaints this week, because people think the Census form asks questions that are too personal. For instance, one of the questions for women is, 'When was the last time you had sex with President Clinton?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gas is a lot more than it used to be. . Clinton said he feels your pain about this. He said he really feels for all the gas station patrons who are trying to cut costs. Because, after what's happened to him the last couple years, he knows what it's like to have to pump it yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Actually, do you know who doesn't get the Internet? George Bush Sr., because he was in a chat room the other day and some wise-ass -- you know how these people are in the chat rooms -- they said, 'Describe your boobs,' and Bush typed in, 'One governs Texas, one governs Florida.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy St. Patrick's day, everybody. Today's the day, of course, millions of Americans put on the silly hats, you drink beer, you party till dawn, or as George W. Bush calls it, '1973.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There are reports today Bill Clinton is having a tough time finding a golf course near his new home in New York that would accept him. . O.J. can play anywhere he wants. Clinton can't get in. That's when you know something is basically wrong.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This week, Clinton proposed an agreement with England to share genetic material. Although Great Britain said today they still have a lot of American DNA left over from when Clinton was in Oxford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A sculptor has been commissioned to carve a statue of Dan Quayle for display in the hall of Vice-Presidents. This means Al Gore, of course, will also have his statue there. There's a job he's been preparing for his whole life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The State Department said today they are easing trade sanctions against Iran. Finally, we're going to trade with Iran and letting Iran send in a few items, like Persian rugs and caviar. Or as Republicans call it, 'essentials.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton marched in today's St. Patrick's day parade.  . Spectators at the parade accused her of pandering to voters, trying to get the vote out. . I gotta say, they might be right, because Hillary was wearing a button that said, 'Kiss me, I'm Irish. Oh -- I'm also Jewish, black, Puerto Rican and a huge Yankee fan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;While marching in yesterday's St. Patrick's Day parade here in New York City, first lady Hillary Clinton was greeted with boos and shouts of 'Go back to Arkansas.' Mrs. Clinton was unfazed by the abuse, however, having endured similar taunting over the past seven years from her husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Chelsea Clinton joined her father today on a historic ten-day trip to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Which brings up an interesting question -- who exactly is baby-sitting whom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;After attending a fundraiser for her Senate campaign thrown by a New York Pakistani group, critics of first lady Hillary Clinton charged this week that as long as the President is in office, special interests by may seek to influence his policies by making donations to his wife. The President laughed off these accusations, however, defying anyone to actually name one of his policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Governor Bush this week blamed President Clinton for the recent increase in gas prices and said if he were president, he'd abolish the gas tax and, if necessary, go to war with Alaska and steal their oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the Washington Post -- they check the grades of all the candidates. They said Al Gore actually got worse grades in college than George W. Bush. Here's the scary part. The next time you watch Bush interviewed on TV, remember, he's the smart one!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is in the news again this week. . I don't think he's the brightest candidate out there. And today a reporter asked Bush how he felt about the NRA, and Bush said, 'Hey, I think the Lakers are going to win everything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton is in India right now. It's his first trip over there. He said everything is new to him, and he feels the same way his wife Hillary does every time she goes to New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As they were stepping out of Air Force One, workers in New Delhi, you know, scrambled to paint walls and repair the pock-marked roads and, you know, cleaned up the city for his visit. Why? Clinton is from Arkansas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;While in India, President Clinton may ride an elephant. Well, that should bring back a lot of memories for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the Secret Service yesterday made Clinton cancel a trip to a small village in Bangladesh because they said it was too dangerous for him. Apparently it's one of those villages where they stone adulterers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Due to pressure from President Clinton, Smith &amp; Wesson announced last week they will install gun locks on all their guns. And due to pressure from Hillary Clinton, Levi Strauss announced they will put zipper locks on all their pants now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems President Clinton is having trouble finding a golf course to play at near his new home in New York, now. I guess the courses don't want to deal with all the increased security. But Clinton's taking it well. In fact, he told the golf course -- he says, 'Look, I don't really want to play here, I just want to be able to tell Hillary I'm leaving the house to play here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Plans are under way now to put up a marble bust of former Vice President Dan Quayle in the US Capitol. And here's the nice part. It will be a fully operational Pez dispenser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're doing a bust of Dan Quayle. And the sculptor was on the news tonight. He said the toughest job, of course, is trying to capture that same blank look that Quayle has in his eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, something happens when it's springtime. Love is in the air. You know what I'm saying, in springtime? Mayor Giuliani called Hillary today. He said, 'Hillary, I'm single, you're single, what do you say?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewinsky is getting serious now about losing weight. It's being reported that she over the weekend hired a personal trainer. She said she knew it was time to hire a trainer when she discovered she had love handles on her ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Tonight.(there are) jokes about President Clinton being in Bangladesh that have me asking who this 'Ladesh' is -- and when did the President start banging her?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton visited Bangladesh today. It's the most crowded nation on earth and one of the poorest. On the up side, it's far away and we don't live there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;On his first stop, Clinton met with a group of children who confessed they get up very early, work hard all day for pennies and have never even met Kathie Lee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton is in India, right now. He's a big hit in India. They love him over there. Because cows are sacred in India, and if anyone knows how to make a cow feel special, it's President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton was in Bangladesh yesterday. No, I'm sorry. He banged someone under the desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some sad news, Ross Perot announced today he will not run for president this year. . An election without Ross? Come on. It's like going to Taco Bell and not seeing the little chihuahua, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Post reporting that Monica Lewinsky has hired a personal trainer. . The guy said in the paper today he's very impressed with her. He told reporters she can do pushups with her tongue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Just 24 hours after she hired this guy, she fired him for talking. Yeah, yeah. Monica firing somebody for opening their mouth, what's that like?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, former President Gerald Ford told the press that if the Republican Party wants to win the upcoming election, George W. Bush has to unite all the Republicans. . After apparently hearing the comment, George W. Bush said, 'Who's Gerald Ford?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that Monica Lewinsky has hired a personal trainer to work out privately with her in her apartment. . When asked about it, Monica said, 'We're gonna start slow, with three-pound cigars. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Our friend Elian Gonzalez back in the news. A federal judge said today he probably is going to have to go back to Cuba. Which is especially disappointing, because -- did you know he was next in line to impregnate Madonna?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;One day after hiring a personal trainer, Monica Lewinsky has fired the guy. Monica says it just didn't work out. He wanted her to get up early, run five miles and do sit-ups. She wanted to watch TV, cartoons, and brush her teeth with mayonnaise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica said she hired the trainer to help her lose weight , and that her goal was to fit into a size 2 desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A US judge decided that Elian Gonzalez, the ship wrecked Cuban boy, should be returned to his father in Cuba. Little Elian will be forced to return home on an inner tube.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton currently in India. . He went on a safari looking at tigers. Of course, this is not the first time Clinton has came face-to-face with a man-eater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night I guess President Clinton called the front desk of the hotel where he was staying at. And he asked the guy, 'When you order Spectravision, the name of the movie doesn't show up on your bill, right?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Senate voted unanimously yesterday to allow people over 65 to work as much as they want and still collect Social Security, with no penalty. So, finally, some good news for the Rolling Stones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A tough week for Elian Gonzalez, you know, the little 6-year-old Cuban boy. On Tuesday, I guess a US court ruled he should be returned to Cuba.  And then today, for two hours, he was fighting off the Ramseys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Texas this week, Governor George W. Bush signed a new law that exempts condoms from sales tax. . In a related story today, Clinton endorsed Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica is Lewinsky now selling handbags. She should be selling grocery bags.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This was in the paper today. 5% of people on antidepressants experience orgasms when they yawn. That means Al Gore could be responsible for more orgasms than Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a New York department store yesterday, while Monica Lewinsky was making a personal appearance. She was heckled by a woman who had to be escorted away by security guards. . Later, the guards released the woman, and then she continued her campaign to be Senator of New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The President in India. Huge crowds. People don't like him here sometimes, but, I tell ya, overseas they love him everywhere he goes. In India, even the untouchables came out for the President. They figured if any world leader was gonna touch them, it would be Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Last night he stayed in Jayper. . Somebody brought up Monica Lewinsky. They shouldn't have, because it prompted one of the wise men to use the old Indian saying, 'Love means never having to spray you're sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Today, Clinton spoke at the India's parliament. And, you know, they're a very proud nation. And you can't tell them what to do. And Clinton said he never presumed to tell a nation of over 1 billion people how to run their affairs -- but would it kill you guys to wear a condom once in a while?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Drug Czar.announced today that cocaine prices are at an all- time low. I tell ya, maybe George W. Bush is a reformer with results.&quot;</SPAN></P>

And he's got, you know, the cigar and he's got the gray beard. He's got the long hair. And then I realize, that's not Castro. That's Elian. He's really old now. He's been here a long time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see President Clinton on the news in India yesterday? This is interesting. Hundreds of women honored him by throwing rose petals on him. And I guess, the thorns ended up scratching his neck . or at least that's what he told Hillary, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But you, know it's nice, each one of the women -- he gave them an autographed copy of the book 'Leaves of Grass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton did say that this week's visit to the Taj Mahal fulfilled one of his life's dreams. I believe the other life dream involved the Barbie twins and a vat of jello.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new report by the White House Director of Drug Policy, the price of illegal drugs is at an all-time low in this country. Crack and heroin the cheapest they've ever been, which is very frustrating if you're a junkie, you know. I mean, the drugs are cheap, but gas is expensive. Oh, and you can't drive downtown to get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;China is planning to make cable TV available to 800 million viewers, but they don't have the Spice Channel. They have the MSG channel. It's a totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky has fired her personal trainer after just one day on the job. Apparently he went to the media and blabbed that he was the personal trainer, and she didn't want that kind of publicity. You know, I understand she's very tight-lipped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess Monica was at a New York City department store yesterday, selling her handbags. She's designing handbags now. And the bags go for $180 each. It's a lot of money. Or you can go to Times Square, pay $50 and get a real Lewinsky. $180 seems like a lot of money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you folks paid your taxes already? . I was going over the 1040 form and there's a box on the 1040 form you can check if you want to send Hillary back to Arkansas.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;People, experts, political pundits are saying now that if Hillary is elected as senator, that she will then after that run for president. . That's all we need, you know? Bill Clinton back in the White House with even more free time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In response to demands by the US for lower gas prices, oil ministers from OPEC met in Vienna. Asked if they were going to help the us out, they said, 'We'll let you know in a day or two, oh great whore, Satan nation of evil.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The meetings were held up when no one could agree on pizza toppings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Asked what the US can do if OPEC does not lower gas prices, a spokesman for the US State Department said, 'It's called the atom bomb. Look into it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'I love my Cuban daddy, but my Cuban daddy doesn't give me toys' news, little Elian Gonzalez continues to stay in America despite a court order sending him back to Cuba. The struggle is between the US, Cuba, and Mia Farrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Campaign finance. They're having that battle now, who's going to take over that mantle. Gore made a proposal this week about campaign finance. He called it, today, 'a cancer on our democracy,' which must explain the time he came into Clinton's office and he was giving a mammogram to a stewardess named Ling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They caught a guy running across the White House lawn. Luckily, authorities said, he never had any real chance of making it to the White House, and they described him as Alan Keyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Down there in Washington last night -- this is kind of scary -- the Secret Service arrested a guy in the middle of the night climbing over the fence at the White House. . And the interesting thing about this, usually when a guy is climbing over the fence at the White House in the middle of the night, it's Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A deranged man jumped a steel fence at White House and ran straight for President Clinton. Clinton is fine. Out of habit he blurted out, 'Hey, I never met your wife, man. Back off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;When it comes to the Presidential race, (Steve) Forbes' endorsement of Bush is expected to have no effect whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Forbes said he decided to make the endorsement after Bush and his buddies threatened to give him a swirly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush said he has already gotten the support of beady-eyed people. Now he can get the bug-eyed vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Experts believe that Forbes' endorsement will practically guarantee our next president is Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Elian Gonzalez.may be facing his last days here in America. They are threatening to throw him back to Cuba, yes. His family apparently is pulling out all the stops. . I think these people just like publicity. Because now they're saying Elian cannot go back to Cuba because he got trapped down a well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Senate has been having hearings on Internet stalking. They listened yesterday to several teenage girls testify about meeting men on the Internet and being lured into a rendezvous where they were forced to perform unspeakable sexual acts. Now, the senators agreed this is not the biggest problem facing America, but they said it sure beats the hell out of listening to Alan Greenspan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There could be some problems for Vice President Al Gore. It seems his campaign chairman, a guy named Tony Coelho, is under criminal investigation for financial irregularities at the 1998 World's Fair. . This could be the biggest setback for the Gore campaign, well, since Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush been complaining. He says he doesn't like having the Secret Service around him. He says they look too much like narcs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush said he's more comfortable with the Texas Rangers. That's who guards him. He wants the Texas Rangers guarding him. Considering his drug use, I think the Dallas Cowboys would be better, probably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the saga of Elian Gonzalez? It's a fascinating story, isn't it? . He's everywhere. I think last night he was involved in a nightclub shootout with Jennifer Lopez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Over the weekend, Hillary Clinton accused Mayor Giuliani of turning Elian Gonzalez into a political football. . Now, wait a minute, let's get this straight. Is he a political football or an international pawn?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Did you remember to change your clocks? . It is said to be a ritual with President Clinton down in Washington. Sunday morning at precisely 2:00 a.m., he moved an intern's hand forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;If you've got Microsoft stock, bad news for you. And, of course, bad news for Bill Gates. Janet Reno was up there saying this guy broke the law and made illegal activities, and told him in a very cute way. She sent him a little message that said, 'You've got jail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Did you hear about the Prime Minister of Japan? . He had a stroke and is in a coma. . On the good side, it gives Americans some idea what it'll be like when Al Gore is president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Elian Gonzalez. . Just before I came out here, late this afternoon, they said that the visa has gone through. So his father will be coming here, possibly as early as tomorrow. . The Justice Department now, of course, needs to find an expert when it comes to picking up family members. So they put in a call to Woody Allen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They did a survey of Americans -- how they feel about this. Six of out of ten Americans think that little Elian should be sent back to Cuba. And 30% think he should stay in America. The rest think, 'You know, this kid can go live with Michael Jackson for all I care. I've had enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian Gonzalez's father has obtained a visa, will be coming to the US. . Yeah, the raft should be coming in any day now depending on the tide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More bad news for Elian Gonzalez today. It turns out he had 500 shares of Microsoft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Microsoft has lost its big antitrust suit with the government. The government said today they have to stop Microsoft. They said they want to stop Microsoft because competition is the American way. Oh, yeah, that's why the most popular board game is Monopoly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As part of an Earth Day special to be shown on ABC, Leonardo DiCaprio.got an exclusive interview with President Clinton. And DiCaprio asked Clinton, you know, what we're doing about global warning, and Clinton asked DiCaprio, 'Hey, got any more naked pictures of Kate Winslet?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know if you've seen this commercial for the census. They show this burning house, the house is burning down, and this couple is watching their house go up in flames because the government didn't know how much fire-fighting equipment they should buy, because people did not fill out their census. . Is the government leaning on us now, like with the Sopranos or something? 'Hey, you know, fill out your census form. It'd be a shame if something was to happen to your beautiful home here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said today that if Hillary wins the Senate race in New York, he has no idea what the duties of the husband of a senator are. I can bet you one thing, it won't be interviewing interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the New York Post, Monica Lewinsky's mom just paid $15,000 for a painting of her daughter. . And that was just to cover the cost of the paint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day Leonardo DiCaprio.interviewed President Clinton at the White House for an ABC Earth Day special. . Leo apparently asked the President to support the environment. And the President asked Leo if he could join his posse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, ladies and gentlemen, I just don't care. I don't need this job, you know? All my money is in Microsoft stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bad news for New York: the murder rate here in New York City is up 13% over last year. . As a result, Mayor Giuliani is putting more police on the streets. And I'm thinking, 'Now wait a minute, isn't that what caused the murder rate to go up?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Japanese Prime Minister is now clinically brain dead. On the bright side, this must be very encouraging news for George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Yesterday, the big opening day in baseball, and it was kind of exciting. Janet Reno marked the occasion by throwing out the first 6-year- old Cuban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Following the disabling stroke of the Japanese Prime Minister and the resignation of the entire cabinet, the country temporarily is being led by the most powerful figure left in Japan, acting Prime Minister Pikachu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Let's get to 'As Elian Gonzalez Turns,' the soap opera. I don't even have time in the monologue to keep you up on all the developments. You will have to read it in 'Soap Opera Digest' tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The big news is that his father, Juan Gonzalez, of course, has his visa. That happened yesterday. Castro was with him today. Apparently, he is absolutely ready to come here to America. He wanted to bring 27 people. Now they have got it down to six. . But they said any more.won't fit on the raft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Al Gore, never losing an opportunity to pander, was at his alma mater last night making a speech talking about how blacks are lacking in access to the Internet. And he said he will not be happy until there's a computer in the home of every black person and they start naming their daughters Pentium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gore wrote a book called 'Earth In The Balance,' about the environment. And Bush has been criticizing it. It came out yesterday he never read the book. And this is not the first time this happened. I tell you, the way Bush talks about books he never read, you think he was still on drugs he never did.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton urging all Americans to honestly fill out their census forms. Clinton? This is a guy who wouldn't even answer a question when he was under oath.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Got my scores back today on my census, 570 on the verbal, 680 on the math.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like Elian Gonzalez's father put off his trip to the US for a while. Yeah, they're waiting for a stronger breeze.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Vice President Al Gore has broken ranks with the Clinton Administration. Gore has come out in favor of granting Elian Gonzalez and his father something called permanent resident status. . That means they will have all the rights of the average American citizen, only they're not allowed to serve on jury duty. Hey, how do I get permanent residency?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore had a birthday this week. . Al likes birthdays, because it's the one day a year he can open gifts without denying he knew it was a gift.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kermit the Frog held a press conference in Washington. . Kermit actually testified, quite seriously, in support of a bill in Congress, the bill regulating the sale of exotic animals. And Kermit testified. In a related story, President Clinton was caught in the Oval Office with Miss Piggy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, while campaigning for the New York Senate seat, Hillary Clinton criticized the National Rifle Association, but then she admitted that she has gone hunting. This is true. Hillary Clinton said she likes to hunt. She couldn't be a very good shot, huh? I mean, Bill's still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the New York Post, Monica Lewinsky's mother just paid $15,000 for a painting of her daughter. . You know the sad part -- in the painting, the desk is blocking her whole face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now, they're talking about Elian's father.coming with five friends and relatives, and they've already (been) granted the visas. So these people are coming to the United States, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is going to screw up the census.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you have filled out your census? You know, that's bad enough, because the long form is, like, 40 pages. But in addition to that, on the 23rd, we all have to get together for a group photo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;ABC has hired Hollywood pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Bill Clinton. . So I guess Leonardo goes to the White House, and was granted total access. After the interview, President Clinton offered to let him sketch an intern in the nude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know, Leonardo was the star of the &quot;Titanic&quot; movie. President Clinton.has a lot in common with the &quot;Titanic.&quot; I mean, you know, many, many people have also gone down on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Japan's new Prime Minister.has decided to keep the current cabinet, including the Minister of Bowing.and the Secretary of Shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Mori finished first among several candidates. Finishing last and, no surprise here, Gary Bauer. Sorry, Gary, just not your year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Miami, hundreds of protesters broke through barricades and joined hands to form a human chain around the home of Elian Gonzalez. Fearing for the boy's safety, protesters then formed another human chain around Michael Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Regardless of your stand on little Elian, I think I speak for all Americans when I say we're really getting sick of you, kid, I'm sorry. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;If you know what happened to Elian Gonzalez today, don't tell me, I'm taping it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Ling Ling -- the panda from China -- died about a year ago. . Apparently, they are not going to give into pressure. . People wanted to stuff and mount Ling Ling. But they said no, they said if people wanted to see a semi-lifelike gift from China to America, they are going to have to vote for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian Gonzalez's father, he arrived in Washington, DC this morning. At least that's where the cab driver who picked him up in Miami dropped him off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess our government pulled some strings to get him here. They got him a visa in one day. They got Castro to release him. In fact, I understand they even called William Shatner at priceline.com to get him a cheaper inner tube.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess he had a good first day. His dad went shopping, and he got a try- out for the Mets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's going to happen here, don't you? In about four weeks, Elian's grandfather is going to be calling, 'I want my son back -- and my grandson!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess this is the first time Elian's dad has ever been to the United States. In fact, he said he was so unfamiliar with this place, he's now thinking of running for Senator from New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, the United States government has given the father a choice. They said today, 'Either take back Elian, or leave the kid here and have another kid with Madonna.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I understand that Elian's father will try to bond with him again, and they're planning some father-and-son activities. I don't know what activities they have planned, but I think you can rule out white-water rafting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said today that if Hillary does win the Senate race in New York, he has no idea what the duties of a husband of a Senator are. Husband of a Senator? He doesn't know what the duties of a regular husband are!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Texas Governor George W. Bush presented his conservation plan for when he runs for president. Six-point plan -- number five is very interesting. He said he would use solar energy to fry death row inmates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Elian Gonzalez's father arrived in the United States today and said he wants to take his son back to Cuba with him immediately. . Apparently, the dad's demands are getting really out of control, because now he also wants to take the kid from 'The Sixth Sense.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Sam Donaldson is furious that ABC chose Leonardo DiCaprio instead of him to interview President Clinton about the environment. . In response, ABC said, 'You know, we couldn't use Donaldson for an interview on the environment, because he wears an endangered woodchuck on his head.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday Hillary Clinton said that it was her idea to ban smoking in the White House. . Hillary said, 'Now, people have to go outside if they want to smoke cigarettes or my husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;What the hell is going on? I wake up this morning and my house is surrounded by Cubans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian Gonzalez' father arrived in the United States, I guess, early this morning, and then later in the day he was interviewed for ABC by Leonardo DiCaprio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was an exciting first day in America for Elian's father. He spent his first night not watching 'Falcone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's too bad that Elian looks like he's going home now. It's too bad, because things were really starting to come together for the kid. He had signed a deal to become the voice of the Taco Bell Chihuahua.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;What really upsets me is the way everybody is jumping in on this thing trying to make themselves look good. . For example, Hillary Clinton today announced that she was part Cuban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton himself is also caught up in the excitement of the Elian Gonzalez case. Last night he had sex in a Castro convertible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Somebody at ABC, an adult, thought it would be a good idea to have Leonardo DiCaprio interview President Clinton. 'So, did you like me in Titanic, dude?' 'Hey dude, did you see me in Gilbert Grape?' What, is Ted Koppel dead? Did I miss something? What about Peter Jennings? What about Mr. Trenchcoat? Is he out of town?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Things Elian Gonzalez's Dad Said His First Day In The United States 10. You people are some Starbucks-lovin' sons of bitches. 9.  I want to thank your great land for not turning my young boy into a political football. 8. Something's wrong with this television -- the picture's in color. 7. Elian can wait -- first I visit the grave of Ricky Ricardo. 6. I will only be interviewed by respected ABC newsman Leonardo DiCaprio. 5. Does anyone know who shot J.R.? 4. I don't care if you are from the Yankees -- I can't pitch. 3. I have just heard a shocking story about your President Clinton and our cigars. 2. As long as I'm here, I also want to take back Jennifer Lopez. 1. What's a Regis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There are rumors that Monica Lewinsky may be considering becoming a lesbian. . Apparently Monica was totally turned off to men after she was betrayed by Linda Tripp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived in Washington today hoping to take his son home. Elian's father took time to check out the sights in the US, like people with food and shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Elian's father was expected to fly to Miami where his son will meet him at the emotional baggage claim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Now that his father is in this country, maybe people will finally start paying attention to this story.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Attorney General Janet Reno says Elian Gonzalez must be returned to his father. Was there any doubt, huh? We're the country who gave the kids back to O.J.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see today, Elian's dad with Janet Reno, looked like the Jolly Green Giant and Sprout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Elian's father and Janet Reno met privately for several hours earlier today, and both said they were nervous, certainly. Elian's dad was nervous because, of course, his future and his son's future was on the line, and Janet Reno was nervous because this was the first time she's ever been alone with a man.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of Americans.not answering the 2000 census. . Some of the questions are being criticized as being too personal. Like the one they ask women, 'What are your turn-ons and turn-offs?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you all know about ABC's news coup, their new news man -- Leonardo DiCaprio. . Do you know DiCaprio is the first 25-year-old to visit the Oval Office and not end up having sex with the President?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Nightline host Ted Koppel, said that he thinks Elian Gonzalez should go back to Cuba with his father. That's what Ted Koppel said. And not only that, Koppel has offered to let the two use his hair as a raft to get over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the Hillary Clinton-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Senate race? You know, it's taking kind of a turn now. Hillary Clinton is ahead in the polls. So I guess next week, Mayor Giuliani is going to begin Plan B. He's going to have her roughed up by the cops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, Elian Gonzalez's father arrived from Cuba, and he's going to take Elian back to Cuba, where they're going to live La Vida Commie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;ABC has hired Hollywood pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Clinton. . I want to tell you, this will be the first dumb blonde in the Oval Office Clinton hasn't hit on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore has begun his search for a vice presidential running mate. He says he is looking for a beloved figure with a high-media profile that people respect. Unfortunately, his first choice is being sent back to Cuba next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The firestorm of controversy surrounding little Elian Gonzalez continues today as the boy's father met with Attorney General Janet Reno. The media spotlight appears to have gone to Juan Gonzalez's head. After the press conference he said he was 'more popular than Jesus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Whether the Justice Department decides to let Elian stay or go, one thing is certain -- his story will be made into a crappy TV movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Juan Gonzalez, Elian's father, finally arrived in Washington today. . He said he wanted to meet Ted Kennedy. He said, 'Here's another guy who knows what it's like to have a chick drown on him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;In Washington, supporters of Al Gore have formed a human chain around the last three things he won't say to get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's funny, Juan Gonzalez, Elian's father, has been in Washington only about ten hours now and George Bush is already running attack ads calling him a Washington insider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The House of Representatives, your Congress, has voted for the third time in five years.a ban on partial birth abortions. . They always bring up the fact that the fetus is extracted with a suction device. You know, I don't know what it is with the Republicans. First Monica, now this. What do they have against suction devices?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see that CBS live TV show last night, 'Fail Safe'? .  There was a part in there, if you didn't see it, if you're familiar with the movie, where the president of the United States, in order to avoid war with Russia, had to order our planes to drop nuclear bombs on New York City, even though he knew that the First Lady was there. Today Clinton said, 'That was my favorite part. Oh, yeah!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The presentation was introduced by distinguished journalist Walter Cronkite. Now, if there are any young people out here, if you don't know the name Walter Cronkite, I should explain. Walter Cronkite was the Leonardo DiCaprio of his generation. He interviewed presidents long before actors did it, you see.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Thirty-five more Cubans were taken into custody after making it to the Florida keys in a wooden boat. And I understand their father is coming next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Janet Reno has ordered that Elian Gonzalez be returned to his father. She said in a press conference the other day, 'A child needs to be with the father.' Which is the same thing Woody Allen told Soon-Yi, 'You need to be with the father.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The government did not give an exact date of when Elian and his dad will be returned to Cuba, but it has something to do with the high tides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you noticed that President Clinton has certainly kept a low profile during this whole Elian Gonzalez thing? You can't blame him. Remember how much trouble he and Monica got into the last time they found a new home for a Cuban?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Everybody filling out the census forms? . I'm doing the long form. One of the strangest questions -- did you see this one? - 'Which two women on The View would you most like to see doing it together?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Kermit the Frog held a press conference in Washington last week. Kermit.was testifying in support of a bill in Congress to regulate the sale of exotic animals. . And now the tabloids.have linked Kermit the Frog to Monica Lewinsky. . Apparently Monica was overheard telling a friend she had a frog in her throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Jenny Craig, they're not using Monica anymore. They've dumped her from those ads. She'll have no trouble finding a desk job, believe me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A North Carolina jury has awarded a husband $30,000 after another man stole his wife. Guy got 30 grand for losing his wife. Today Clinton said, 'Hey, how do I get in on that deal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Sunday, it was about 20 degrees, and we got ten inches of snow. Crazy! But here in the city, I'm telling you, Mayor Giuliani was right on the snow. . As soon as it started to snow, he had police shoot it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Mental health experts will meet today with Elian Gonzalez's relatives. As the saga drags on, another problem has emerged: How the hell can I keep making jokes about Elian Gonzalez?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Elian is meeting with psychologists to help get over the trauma he will suffer, specifically that there is no Space Mountain in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Experts feel that little Elian will be just as important a figure when he returns to Cuba because 6-year-olds are really good at picking plantains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Let me catch up on the Elian Gonzalez saga. . The Justice Department today assured the boy's father -- Juan Gonzalez -- that he may have to stay in America and is allowed to and welcome to for up to ten months while the appeals process goes on. And this was good news to the Cubans in Miami because they think surely if he's going to stay here ten months, he will decide to stay in America and raise Elian here, along with the son that he has probably already fathered with Madonna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Monica Lewinsky is in the news. . 'The Enquirer' last week was saying that Monica probably has given up on men and is turning to women. I think it's all a big misunderstanding. It's just that her neighbors, the people up the stairs from Monica, overheard her moaning when she was eating Sara Lee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, the big opening baseball game at Baltimore's Camden Yards. President Clinton threw out the first pitch, and Attorney General Janet Reno stepped out, threw out the first Cuban boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;When Elian's dad finally meets with Elian, wouldn't it be great, as a joke, if he just said, 'Well, that's not my son.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It looks like he's finally gonna be going back to Cuba. But the good news is, 'Nightline' said today they may bring him back for May sweeps.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're trying to get Leonardo DiCaprio to interview him (the Cuban boy). At least that's what the head of ABC News, Britney Spears, said today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush was here in Los Angeles over the weekend. He told a woman's group he's a different kind of Republican, who welcomes new faces into the party. Well, he certainly came to the right town, didn't he? People in this town get a new face, what, every month? Some of them start out with two faces right from the beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody filled out their census yet? . I love these people,. 'These questions are too personal. This is an intrusion.' That's what I love about Americans, you know? We have cybersex with strangers on a computer. We give credit card numbers to phone sex operators. Yet god forbid the government should know how many bedrooms are in a house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that CBS TV movie 'Fail Safe' the other night? It was pretty good. In the movie, they dropped a nuclear bomb, they dropped an atomic bomb on New York City. In fact, when the bomb first went off, people just assumed, 'Oh, the police, they were retaliating against an unarmed black man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;China is going to give the National Zoo in Washington a pair of giant pandas who, interestingly enough, have thus far been unable to mate. . Which means there will continue to be a couple in Washington with a sex life as bad as the Clintons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's the middle of April, it's cold here in New York City.  . So cold here today, I tried to get Janet Reno to send me back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I have a special message and announcement for the father of Elian Gonzalez, Juan Gonzalez. Juan? Listen to me, Juan. This is your last chance to see 'Cats' before it closes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Signs President Clinton Is Bored 10. Spent weekend alphabetizing thousands of lawsuits pending against him; 9. Weekly radio address features less talk, more rock; 8. Every twenty minutes, calls Area 51 to ask 'Any new aliens?'; 7. Often cuts cabinet meetings short to catch 'Judge Judy'; 6. Hefty intern starts working in Oval Office, and he doesn't even grab her ass; 5. Watched every episode of 'Falcone'; 4. To stir up controversy, gave Delaware to the Dutch 3. In addition to Leonardo DiCaprio, agreed to do an interview with little girl in Pepsi commercials; 2. Has started smoking cigars; 1. Actually tried to sleep with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The leaders of North and South Korea will meet in June. The leaders will meet to discuss issues of border security, trade sanctions, and whether a Daewoo is even crappier than a Hyundai.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Both nations share much in common, including language, customs, and tasty recipes for poodle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The biggest sticking point in the long standing conflict is who gets custody of Margaret Cho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The big news is that Janet Reno is coming down to Miami tomorrow. As usual, she's the only one in the Administration with any testicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Microsoft has hired Ralph Reed.as a lobbyist to convince George W. Bush.to go soft on Microsoft, who is in a lot of trouble. Boy, there's a switch. A member of the Christian right urging a politician not to look into windows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Robert Ray said today he's going to spend an additional $3. 5 million of your money to pursue a perjury conviction against President Clinton for his dealings with Monica. . I'll tell you, by the time they finish this investigation, they will be checking semen stains with carbon dating.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Seems two giant pandas arrived at the Washington zoo all the way from China this week. Bad news, five minutes after they got here, Janet Reno demanded they return to their father in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Been watching CNN all day, the Cuban News Network.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Janet Reno, man, she is getting tough with the relatives of Elian Gonzalez because, you know, they refused to turn the kid over today. More problems, yeah. She said either they give the kid up by tomorrow, or she's sending them the Ramseys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday Vice President Al Gore got caught in some more exaggerations. . I guess he hosted a fundraiser attended by 50 gay and lesbian activists. He not only told them he wrote the song 'YMCA' -- he also told them he was the cowboy in the Village People.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Florida Governor Jeb Bush.announced that he will not allow the execution of mentally retarded convicts. He's gonna send them to his brother in Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky now says she's gonna vote for Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate race. Monica voting for Hillary - I'm sure Hillary's thrilled to have that endorsement. Hillary not only has the woman vote, now she also has 'the other woman' vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Doctors in Washington now say John Hinckley Jr. (is) well enough to be let out to wander the streets of Washington, D.C. on his own. He can go out on field trips by himself. What an odd country we live in, huh? We send a 6-year-old back to Cuba, but Hinckley, 'La, la, la, la.' Hey, I'm going' to the gun show in Virginia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I have an update on Elian Gonzalez. He has decided to stay. He's going to stay in the United States and become a Latin pop star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Rush Limbaugh says he wants to be a sportscaster now for ABC's Monday Night Football. Rush says he's just like everyone else. He's just a normal average guy who's lowered into his pants one leg at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A government plan to reunite Elian Gonzalez with his father was put on hold, because according to his uncle, the boy did not want to go. It should be noted that all the uncle asked Elian this question, 'You don't want to not go, do you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I have to catch up on little Elian Gonzalez again. Well, Janet Reno's on the scene. Now this thing is going to get resolved. . She didn't threaten the drunk uncles exactly. What she said was, 'Waco and smell the coffee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Reno.said if there was one bright spot in this whole thing, it reinforced her decision never to have children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The President of China went over to Israel today. He's there trying to get an Israeli radar that we don't want the Israelis to sell to the Chinese because they could be our enemies. . The Israeli radar is a little different. Not only can it spot planes and missiles, but it tells you if you're spending too much for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush now this week has taken on the issue of health care, which some people think is odd, because Texas has one of the worst public health records in the nation and has for many years. I don't want to say that Bush doesn't really know a lot about health care, but he thinks that Kaiser-Permanente is the leader of Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see what's going on with the new hit sitcom, 'Elian in the Middle.' . The actor Andy Garcia held a press conference in front of the house. Gloria Estefan, she held a press conference in front of the house. Darva Conger wants to marry little Elian now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some people say that if Elian goes back to Cuba, he'll be used for propaganda. You know, unlike here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The family today released a video of Elian saying he doesn't want to leave. In fact, Elian says what he really wants, he wants to direct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He was speaking in Spanish on a home video, and he addressed his father by saying he did not want to return to Cuba with his father. . Actually, it's hard to make out exactly what Elian was saying, because of the sound. You know, in the background you could hear his new puppy barking at the bunny, and the singing clowns, and the Playstation, the DVD player was going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky said she's gonna vote for Hillary Clinton for the Senate. . First she's under Bill, now she's behind Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;They did not meet the 2:00 PM deadline.to hand Elian over to authorities. And I guess the relatives are really starting to run out of excuses. Because today they said they missed the deadline because their dog ate Elian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian Gonzalez is ready to leave the country. Last night he saw the final episode of Falcone. And today, he unloaded all his tech stocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewinsky has been offered a part in a new romantic comedy called 'Crimes of Fashion,' and I believe she's going to be playing the heavy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Earlier today a federal appeals court in Miami issued a temporary restraining order that will keep Elian Gonzalez in the US for at least four more days. Elian himself spoke to reporters, saying, 'Hey, even I don't give a crap about me anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Let me catch up on Elian Gonzalez. . I'm so bored with this kid, I wish Clinton and Monica would get back together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The drunk uncles are defying Janet Reno and saying they're not going to be able to get this kid except by force. I don't know, do we really want this kid raised by guys stupid enough to get into a hostage situation with Janet Reno?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Everyone is getting involved now. Gloria Estefan got involved. She challenged the father to come to Miami. Andy Garcia then got involved. He said the boy should decide his own fate. Now everyone is afraid to make a move until the Taco Bell dog weighs in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush.finally met with the gay Republican organization. .  I don't know if they met politically, but I think something can be worked out, because they're gay and he's a guy that did a lot of liquor and drugs. So even if they don't have a meeting of the minds politically, they can always open a disco.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I got an idea. Let's keep Elian Gonzalez in this country, send Alan Greenspan on a raft back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see all those wildfires burning out of control down there in Florida? 15,000 acres destroyed so far. You know, when I first turned on CNN, I saw all the flames and went, 'Uh-oh, Janet Reno's trying to smoke 'em out now. Here we go again!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Janet Reno is pretty upset. . People said they haven't seen her this angry -- well, since she was cut by the Knicks in '84, remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, she was so mad yesterday, in Miami, police actually heard her going, 'Fe, fi, fo, fum -- bring me Elian!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess it's been a while, what, four, five, six months since Elian has seen his father? Because, yesterday, Janet Reno went to the house and Elian looked up at her and went, 'Dad?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian's dad not quite so diplomatic. Did you seem him today? Gave the finger to the TV cameras. Which is a good sign. Maybe once he defects, he'll become a cab driver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Castro on the news today? He said he's considering retiring. You know what that means? He could end up living in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George w. Bush was asked today whether he thought Al Gore would give Bill Clinton a presidential pardon if he became president, and Bush said that Clinton had stated he wouldn't seek a pardon, and Bush takes Clinton at his word. Isn't it ironic? The only person still left in the whole country who still believes Clinton is the Republican candidate for president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Plans are under way now for the $100 million Clinton presidential library. Historians say this will be the only presidential library in history with a mirror on the ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;TV stations aired a video of Elian Gonzalez saying he wants to stay in America. And experts are saying that the video looks like the boy was coached on what to say.that it was not natural. And they may have a point, because at the end of the video, you can hear Regis Philbin asking, 'Is that your final answer?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Several conservative groups accused George W. Bush of pandering for votes because he met with a group of gay Republicans. They say he's pandering. They may be right, because shortly after the meeting, Bush made an announcement that Ricky Martin has a sweet ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton is getting a refund on his taxes. Now, this guy was cited for contempt of court. This guy was impeached. This guy lied to the American public. And I'm thinking we should be getting a refund.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush met with gay Republicans. A gay republican, that's a complicated person. The gay Republicans hate Hillary Clinton, but they love what she's done with her hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;On this day in 1865, President Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater. He was there attending the premiere of 'Cats.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;135th anniversary of President Lincoln's assassination. To commemorate the event, earlier today, President Clinton went to the theater and took a shot at an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Stocks plummeted today in heavy trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average down a record 616 points. It was so bad, Janet Reno wants to send Alan Greenspan back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There were so many people in front of Elian Gonzalez's house yesterday, some of the Miami Marlins players went over there, because, you know, they've never seen a crowd.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;CBS announced today they are the first network -- this is true -- they're gonna make a movie of the week about Elian Gonzalez. . I guess casting already under way. Janet Reno gonna be played by Jack Palance. . I think Erik Estrada is the older Elian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You'll see him as he grows. I think it's called, 'Don't Make Room for Daddy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Senate candidate Hillary Clinton spent a couple of days as a principal at a New York area high school. I was thinking about it. It would be great having Hillary as your principal, don't you think? You get caught cheating, she'd forgive you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, a big fundraiser sponsored by Dreamworks in Beverly Hills. . Al Gore and President Clinton were there. And Al Gore spoke, very emotional speech. He said many, many times he saw President Clinton nearly buckle. Not as many times as Monica saw him unbuckle, but almost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, ABC showed 'The Ten Commandments.' . And right afterwards.apparently Bill Clinton demanded a two-minute rebuttal. He said, 'I agree with seven of them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The government said yesterday, you are now five times more likely to be murdered than you are to be audited by the IRS. . Maybe that should be the new motto for the IRS, 'your money or your life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Elian Gonzalez's father giving the media the finger on TV last week? Gave everybody the finger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's more of a New Yorker than Hillary now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Castro is getting mad. See what he said today? He said if Elian doesn't come back to Cuba soon, he will lose his job at the Nike factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The folks at CBS announced they're going to make a TV movie out of Elian Gonzalez. How's that for a success story? That's pretty good. . I mean, six months ago, this kid was washed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The kid's got a lot of charisma. He could be a good actor. You know, the sad part is, he's now too old to play himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's talk now of making a weekly series with this kid. . In fact, I understand in the pilot episode, Elian ends up on an island with the Harlem Globetrotters. Yeah, it's an episode of 'Gilligan's Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Al Gore spoke at a rally of janitors who are on strike. And Gore spoke alternately in English and Spanish. . Which marks the first time Gore has been simultaneously ignored in two languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Monica Lewinsky (said she) has a handsome new boyfriend and that her life is very happy. . The former intern describes her triumph over adversity these couple of years as a real Fellatio Alger story.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He should learn how our legal system works.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know what Elian's father should do? He should go down to the house in Miami where Elian is, slip on the front steps, fake a back injury, win the house, evict the relatives, sell the house, and you and Elian will be the richest guys in Cuba!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;People getting' over this terrible storm . It destroyed a trailer park. In fact, the only trailer homes left undamaged were the ones weighted down by Clinton girlfriends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush says he's considering former rival John McCain to be his running mate for vice president. . And people are saying, 'Why would you pick a partner that hates you?' Hey, it worked for Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;McCain has the experience to be vice president -- spent five years as a POW, sitting in the same room, day after day, nothing to do, nobody to talk to, what better training for vice president than that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;ABC'S annual broadcast of 'The Ten Commandments' drew its largest audience in four years the other night. . Apparently, Charlton Heston forced a lot of viewers to watch at gunpoint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's beautiful all over the country today. In fact, in Miami, the weather was so nice, Elian Gonzalez floated in an inner tube just to cool off today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian Gonzalez.is just on the news every second of the day. In fact, that's CNN's new motto, 'All Elian, all the time.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I have no idea how long this kid's been here now, but today, I saw the kid in an ad for Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, outside of Elian's house in Miami, the crowd attacked a guy. A guy was holding up a sign that said, 'Send Elian Home.' The crowd attacked him, tore his sign up, pushed him to the ground. Then they went back to holding up their signs that said, 'Protect Free Speech,' and 'No Freedom In Cuba.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ted Kennedy was in town this week. Uncle Ted was here to show support for L.A.'s striking janitors. Senator Kennedy says he had a lot of respect for the men and women who clean up other people's messes -- you know, in his case, his father, his lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Vermont has become the first state in the union to give legal rights to same-sex couples. That gives them all the benefits of a legally married couple without having to actually get married. And you know straight guys must be going, 'That sounds pretty good, honey, why can't we do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who I feel sorry for? The single women in Vermont. Remember how women always used to say, 'The good ones are either married or gay?' Now, they're both -- they're married and gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day, an 8-year-old child got to ask the first lady a question. An 8-year-old child asked Hillary Clinton if she's more famous than Leonardo DiCaprio. And she said, 'Definitely not.' . Hillary also admitted she's not as feminine as DiCaprio.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, he's reissued his book now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's reinstating his proposal for Earth Day. He's calling to abolish the internal combustion engine. . What, does he have the Unabomber writing his speeches now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This Sunday in Miami, Janet Reno, sponsoring the big tear gas canister hunt down there in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know by now, the courts have ruled that Elian Gonzalez needs to stay in America until all his appeals are through. Boy, you can just hear the folks at Toys 'R Us going, 'Yes!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian's father is urging all Americans to write to President Clinton to tell him to return his son to him. And you can't blame this guy. He has been treated terribly. . The last time a Cuban was treated this badly, it ended up inside Monica Lewinsky's thong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;CBS is going to air a made-for-television movie about the Elian Gonzalez story. . Unfortunately, the movie will be interrupted every five minutes for live updates on the Elian Gonzalez story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Mayor Giuliani's wife, actress Donna Hanover, has apparently accepted a role in a controversial play called 'The Vagina Monologues.' .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian Gonzalez has been reunited with his father. I guess they grabbed the little boy a little after 5:00 in the morning on Saturday. In fact, Janet Reno called President Clinton to tell him it was going to happen. In fact, that's why they had to wait until 5:00 in the morning. It took that long to try and track down where Clinton was sleeping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see that picture of the federal agent inside Elian's relatives' house with the gun? He had the gun aimed at Elian and the fisherman who originally rescued him. . Here's my question. It's 5:00 in the morning. What the hell was the fisherman doing there? I mean, at 5:00 in the morning, he's in the closet holding a 6-year-old boy. I think we're grabbing the wrong people here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Federal agents not only found the boy after storming and searching the house. Listen to this: they also found 16 Easter eggs, so pretty successful all the way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today Uncle Lazaro.said, 'You know, we really got to get a peephole for that front door. This is crazy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said on the news tonight that this was the most controversial reunion -- well, since Diana Ross tried to get back together with The Supremes . And there was a lot more gunplay in that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The relatives want to see him. And the father is putting all kinds of restrictions on any kind of visit by the relatives. Gee, I wonder where he learned that trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today they had all the pictures out of Elian and his dad being reunited. And they're both smiling. I guess they released these photos because they wanted to show that Elian was happy and that everything was okay.  But, hey, I've seen photos of Bill and Hillary smiling. That doesn't mean everybody's happy, and everything is okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Just because Elian and his dad are together, it doesn't mean they're going back to Cuba . The government said today that they are taking every necessary precaution to ensure that Elian does not leave the country. In fact, to make sure he doesn't leave, today they took away his inner tube.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This being America, everybody is jumping on it. Today the Franklin Mint just issued 'The Battle of Elian&quot; chess set. Every piece is a pawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;USA Today says Janet Reno's Justice Department is leaning strongly towards breaking up Microsoft . Step one, they already have a pre- dawn raid on Bill Gates' house tomorrow morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday was the traditional Easter egg roll. It was held on the White House lawn. And Clinton was a little rusty . He didn't do too good. The last time he rolled something that was egg-shaped, it was Monica Lewinsky. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio interviewed the President. . President Clinton said that he personally.has saved the government over $100,000 a year by lowering lights at the White House -- or as he calls it, 'mood lighting.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Do I look haggard, do I look exhausted, do I look frenzied to you? 5:00 this morning, bang! My front door is kicked in. Immigration agents come in, drag me out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Did you see the pre-dawn raid down there in Miami? I'm telling you something, I haven't seen so many automatic weapons since the last time Puff Daddy went to a nightclub.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Immigration agents were very clever. They told the family they were from the Publisher's Clearinghouse Prize Patrol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian could not be reached for comment today. He's been busy being exploited by a different set of relatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Rudy Giuliani has come out against the raid. He's against it all. I think it's probably because the police didn't shoot anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton was so moved by the whole thing that just before dawn this morning, he took an intern by force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;72 hours after the dramatic pre-dawn raid that reunited Elian Gonzalez with his father, shock waves still being heard. . On the upside of all of this, this story has taken one giant step towards being over. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Justice Department is now leaning toward breaking up Microsoft into three separate companies. The breakup is being blamed on Bill Gates' arrogance, a government vendetta, and for some odd reason, Yoko.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a related story, a Federal judge has ruled that they will settle the Elian Gonzalez situation in the same manner by breaking him up into three smaller Cuban children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's all about little Elian Gonzalez today. . It's all really because of that picture that we all saw, the soldier there with little Elian. It has become now the most famous image of a Hispanic in a closet, not counting Ricky Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;You're probably like me, you woke up Saturday, you saw this on the TV. Suddenly, you saw this picture of the little kid surrounded by guys with guns and fatigues. I thought the kid had been here so long that he was starting high school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush, the little Bush kid. He said that he is, 'profoundly saddened and troubled by the Gonzalez raid.' I think what happened was he saw those pictures of guys busting into the house, and it brought back bad memories of him having to flush his stash down the toilet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Things now have quieted down there in Miami. The Cubans who have been forming a human chain around the house have gone back to forming their old human chain, around the unemployment office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It just doesn't stop. People starting fires, overturning cars, throwing rocks and bottles. What did they have -- over 300 people arrested today? Not in Miami, those are just Microsoft shareholders looking at stock prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I invested in a new company today, I think it's gonna do well. . It's called Janet Reno Wake-Up Call.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A Gallup poll shows the majority of Americans approve of the raid on Elian's relatives' house. 60%.approve of the government's actions. 35% disapproved. And 98% want to know what the hell that fisherman was doing in the closet at 5:00 in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The whole world has seen that photo of the gun being pointed at the closet. . One good thing about showing that photo, though - it made a lot of people suddenly fill out their census forms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian's cousin and uncle heard from Michael Jackson. He was commiserating with them. He told them he knows what it's like to have a young boy get away from you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;People keep asking, why did they have to use assault rifles? . Janet Reno said it was because every step of the way, Miami relatives kept moving the goal post. And, you know, as a former fullback, she hates that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said the night before, the only time Janet Reno left her office.was to stop at the dry cleaners, which -- I didn't even know she was dating Clinton, did you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Congressional Republicans, now they're blaming this whole thing on President Clinton. . But, you know, Clinton didn't have anything to do with this . If Clinton had planned this operation, they would have grabbed the cute 21-year-old cousin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who's gonna benefit from this whole thing? Parents. Because every time your kid does something wrong, now you can say, 'Hey, don't make me call Janet Reno.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Here in New York City last night, President Clinton and Al Gore had a fundraiser. . President Clinton gave a speech, and he said that he feels absolutely comfortable putting the future of his daughter, and someday his grandchildren, in the hands of Al Gore. . In response, Gore told Clinton, 'Stay the hell away from my daughters and grandchildren or you will get an ass kicking.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This just in: The INS has broken into Ricky Martin's house...grabbed him out of the living room, and hustled him off in a van.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now Congress wants to hold hearings. That's right, the United States Congress wants to hold hearings about the Elian Gonzalez case. Well, that ought to speed things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know Juan Gonzalez? He would like to go back to Cuba because he has a job there. He works as a doorman at a hotel, and that's a pretty good gig. You know, he has to flag down Cuba's only cab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A 3-year-old mutt was abandoned on the 91 Freeway in Riverside yesterday and was later safely rescued by local police. Officials say the dog will be held for evidence until Friday, at which point Janet Reno will send it back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Speaking of Cuba, in the wake of the seizure of young Elian Gonzalez, Cuban leaders urged all merchants in Miami to close their businesses. Also attempting to shut down Miami streets, old ladies in giant Cadillacs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Miami officials are not worried about the strike because, according to immigration records, there are only 12 Cubans in all of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Jordan's King Abdullah today. They talked long into the night about the fate of the Middle East. At first they agreed, then they agreed to disagree. Then they agreed again, then they arranged for Yasser to move his stuff into the royal palace just to try things out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;You're here to get your daily Elian Gonzalez fix. . He's now in a house at the Wye River plantation, living there with his father. . President Clinton weighed in today. He said, you know, 'Leave this family alone. They've been through enough.' He said, 'I know what it's like to be desperate enough to try hiding someone in a closet.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Now, the relatives.said President Clinton is being blackmailed by Fidel Castro. . Clinton wants the boy here and does not want him to go back to Cuba, because Castro is blackmailing Clinton with telephone sex tapes.  . We cannot let some foreign dictator blackmail our president about sex. That is the job of the Republicans in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The other thing the crazy relatives want to do is.they are pressing for a shared living arrangement . Some sort of house where they can all live together. Psychologists are saying this is not really workable, but it is a great sitcom premise for Paul Rodriguez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Vermont has made history today . They are the first state where gay couples have the exact same rights as any other married couple. They are expecting a lot of gay people now to want to move to Vermont. That is, until they find out that the closest thing they have there to a disco is bingo night at the Elks Lodge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, it was hot here in southern California. In fact, it was so hot that people were hoping that INS agents could kick the door in just for the cool breeze coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Four of Elian Gonzalez's little playmates are coming over from Cuba to visit with him. You know, let's hope none of these kids have any wacky relatives in Miami, huh? This thing could start all over again!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think Castro is trying to invade -- very slowly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The State Department announced yesterday that Elian Gonzalez's family -- his father and his stepmom -- have been moved to a new, secret location, which I hope it's better than that last secret location -- the closet with the creepy fisherman in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said he's at a farm somewhere outside Washington, D.C. . Every night, Elian is sleeping in a different bed. The kid said, 'I feel like the President of the United States.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The American people appear to be on the government's side on this. Something like 60% feel the government did the right thing. In fact, 89% of the people said they would approve of the Federal government using force to remove annoying relatives from their home during the holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Bush told him, 'I don't view you as the enemy.' In fact, Bush said, 'I have no idea who the hell you are.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hard to believe, it's been 25 years since the us pulled out of Vietnam . In fact, today, President Clinton said it feels like just yesterday he was watching the footage of the war on TV in England.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, in Times Square, a wax statue of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was unveiled . The statue is apparently so lifelike that the Mayor's wife, Donna Hanover, won't go near it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today in the Supreme Court, the Boy Scouts of America defended their policy against homosexuality, saying they only exclude scoutmasters who are openly gay. One justice then pointed out that 'openly gay' could be defined as 'any adult willing to be seen in that outfit.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian Gonzalez is now with his father in the Washington, D.C., area . What a year this kid has had. And when he gets back to Cuba, he's really going to be behind. He will have missed a lot, you know. For example, he will have missed an entire semester of commie brainwashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian's relatives in Miami, understandably so, are very, very edgy . Whenever a Jehovah's Witness comes to the front door.they hide in the closet now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian and his father, they're in the Washington, D.C., area, and whenever his relatives from Miami come to visit, they're turned away by armed guards. And I'm thinking, 'I wish that would happen when my relatives come to visit me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The State Department is bringing some of his playmates from Cuba. They're bringing them up to visit him in the Washington, D.C., area. And I'm thinking, 'Great. That's just what this country needs, more six- year old Cubans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think the last time four playmates visited Washington, D.C., Clinton invited Miss October, Miss November, Miss December, Miss January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Four Cuban classmates of Elian Gonzalez have been given permission to come to play with Elian. They will come as soon as Janet Reno arranges for them to be taken from their homes at gun point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The State Department said they will allow the visit as a gesture of good will. Plus, one of them throws a 98 mile per hour fastball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a related story, a dozen INS agents busted into an L.A. house and seized Mini-me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Supreme Court held a hearing to determine whether the Boy Scouts acted illegally when they fired a gay scout master. If they lose the lawsuits, they could be forced to change their motto from 'be prepared,' to 'I will survive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Senator John McCain was in Vietnam today visiting the so- called Hanoi Hilton where he was held captive during the Vietnam War. He suffered terrifying flashbacks of running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The work stoppage in Miami is over. Thank God the Cubans, who were so ticked off about Elian are back to work. And that's a good thing.if the men there weren't idle enough with Madonna being pregnant again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Elian, of course, with his father there. They're having quiet time. It seems to have quieted down. And the father, apparently, his big concern is that Elian has become too Americanized, and he may be onto something there, because there's a few people in the room today, and somebody's cell phone rang. And Elian said, 'Is that me or you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;In Washington, George Bush had the biggest black-tie fundraiser ever -- $18 million-plus they raked in there . Bush.was the guest of honor. And he is used to that. He likes to be the guest of honor, because, of course, for most of his life, he knows what it's like being toasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is take your daughter to work day. Of course, being election year and all, you see all the politicians today participating in this. On the news they showed Al Gore at work with his three attractive daughters. And, of course, George Bush, he has two attractive daughters. President Clinton was there with his four beautiful, attractive daughters. Who could they have been?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot today, Janet Reno ordered federal agents to break down the door at Ben &amp; Jerry's.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Janet Reno struck again today. . apparently, she has now ordered federal agents to seize Desi Arnaz, Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A psychiatrist who examined Elian Gonzalez says he may have a romantic crush on his 21-year-old cousin. He's only 6, she's 21. Man, them Latin guys are unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian and his father are staying at an 1,100-acre plantation in Maryland. What a country this is. You come over on an inner tube, you're on 1, 100 acres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see the place on the news? It's bigger than Cuba! . They say they're doing it to give Elian and his father more room to play. Play what? Polo?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, four of Elian's classmates from Cuba are coming. . So I guess somebody's car in Cuba doesn't have any tires on it tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night in Washington, George W. Bush set a new all-time political fundraising record. Raised $21.3 million at one dinner. I guess the NRA was there, tobacco lobby was there. . And, just to rub it into Al Gore, you know what the main course was? Spotted owl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, announced he's being treated for prostate cancer. . And I guess New Yorkers are rallying behind him. In fact, if you're in New York City today and someone gives you the finger, they're just reminding you to get a prostate exam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Supreme Court are hearing arguments now on whether the Boy Scouts' ban on gays is constitutional. . The good news is both sides did come to one agreement. Both gays and straight agree the silly shorts and kerchief have to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today is national take your daughter to work day. Or, as they call it in the White House, 'back off Mr. President, she's only 16' day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other night, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton appeared at the same fundraiser. . Their advisers had an argument over who should get to make the longer speech. . In the end, they decided to give the honor to Hillary, because they realized Gore's speech would seem longer anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, the Supreme Court.heard arguments about whether the Boy Scouts of America should allow gay scout leaders. . The main argument that gay men would make great scout leaders is that they know better than anyone how to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;II's bring your daughter to work day today. . It was actually started by Bill Clinton about eight years ago when he was spotted leaving the Oval Office one night with an 18- year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This just in: Elian Gonzalez's pet chihuahua Peppy is being helicoptered from Havana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Six of Elian's classmates are coming from Cuba to spend some time with him. Fidel let them off -- gave them the week off from rolling cigars, so they'll be here. And the kids are already being scouted by the Yankees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm very disappointed in the way the media is handling this whole Elian Gonzalez thing. I mean, honestly, by now, don't you think we should have seen that hot cousin Marisleysis naked in Playboy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The INS has gone nuts . Earlier today, they launched a pre-dawn raid on Jennifer Lopez's ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Classes Elian Gonzalez Has Missed 10. The Proper Way To Greet an INS Officer Sticking a Gun in Your Face 9.

Nutritious, Well-Balanced Meals: Who Needs 'Em?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Cuba, Fidel Castro spoke angrily about the stalled legal process involving the little boy. Janet Reno says if Castro has a problem he should talk to her man to man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;During a Connecticut rally in support of Martin Luther King's holiday, Jesse Jackson came face to face with KKK members . They did agree on one thing -- send that frigging Cuban kid back to Cuba already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Rudy Giuliani held a press conference to announce that he has a treatable form of prostate cancer. In accordance with his wishes, the prostate will be surgically removed, taken into a dark alley and shot 41 times:&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Clinton said she was shocked and saddened by the news and promised to pull the pin out of the ass of her Mayor Giuliani voodoo doll right away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Big news about Elian Gonzalez. . The Washington Post did an interview today with the fisherman in the closet. And it turns out he is not a fisherman. . He's a janitor. This is what he meant when he said the kid needed a custodian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Janet Reno today had to defend further her actions in snatching the kid out of the house. She revealed that.family members put a couch in front of the door. Which took a lot of work because they had to drag it in from the front lawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush had a fundraiser . They thought it was going to bring in $18 million. Well, it topped that. Brought in $21 million, for one dinner. That's quite a dinner. . And fittingly, it was one of the most glitzy affairs ever. The ballrooms had laser beams, mirror balls. And a disco band. And just to get into the atmosphere, George Bush wore his old coke spoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Mayor Giuliani had a little press conference today, and we wish him well. He is not the healthiest man right now. . He has prostate cancer. . The good news is that it is completely treatable, and he will be better. The bad news is, the treatment involves a New York City police officer wielding a toilet plunger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian and his dad are hanging out on their 1,100-acre plantation where the government has put them. Is that the most beautiful place you've ever seen? And today, the father, Juan Miguel, told the government, 'Take your time on this asylum thing. There's no hurry.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I understand earlier today, Elian and his dad enjoyed a wine tasting, shared a wedge of brie, then went on a fox hunt. They come here as Tony Montana, they leave as Martha Stewart now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Four of Elian's playmates have arrived from Cuba, plus their parents, plus a Cuban doctor, plus 12 more playmates are coming and his former kindergarten teacher. You know, last person out of Cuba, would you turn the lights off, please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There are so many communists on that Maryland plantation now they've kicked out the owner and they've turned the place into a collective farm. It's now the people's plantation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That shows you how quickly fortunes can change in America. Today, Elian Gonzalez living on an 1,100-acre estate. An hour ago, Bill Gates washed up in Cuba on a raft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton spoke at the Arkansas School of Law. In his speech, Clinton said, if he were to learn that his life were going to end today and he had just one wish -- he did the little lip bite -- his wish (would be) that we could find it in our hearts to be one America. Now, that's a good sentiment, but we all know Clinton, huh? If his life is going to end and he had one wish, wouldn't you think it would involve maybe Heather Locklear and a vat of Jell-o?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll be performing for the President tomorrow night. . Not as an intern. I mean I'll be doing jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian and his father are at a beautiful 300-acre retreat in Maryland. It's so nice, as a matter of fact, earlier today, Castro decided to defect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They're going to send up some of his classmates, like, four or five of his classmates. . The classmates.I guess, yesterday, left Havana in a 1955 Buick.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We taxpayers are footing the bill for all this. Elian and his dad are still enjoying that 1,100-acre estate in Maryland. 'Casa de Commie,' I believe it's called.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today Elian learned his first words of English. It was, 'Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some good news for Elian's cousin. What's her name -- Hystericlesis? . She's still not allowed to see Elian, but she has been signed to star in 'Scream 4.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new report, the deadliest occupation in the United States (is) a black guy on a sunny day in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush says he's been working with one of his father's foreign policy advisers. And Bush says the adviser is able to explain foreign policy in a way that he can understand. The adviser uses a color-coded map to point out which countries are cowboys and which countries are Indians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;ABC, you know has been off the air for a couple of days, having a big fight with Time-Warner . And they just blacked them out, they weren't on the air . All things have been settled. Here's what I don't understand. We've got Elian Gonzalez, they can't settle that under a year, but when it comes to television, by God, we'll get that settled overnight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian Gonzalez, him and all his little playmate friends, are in the United states from Cuba. They loved watching the blank screen, because, you know, to them, it was just like TV in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;There's 2 million Americans in some form of jail or prison. . And most of them, of course, for the same crime. Raise your hands, how many of you are in here for lying about sex under oath?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore hitting the campaign trail pretty hard, campaigning pretty hard. Sunday, he was in Washington at a gay rights rally, spoke out in favor of gay rights. Yesterday, at the Atlanta YMCA, he unveiled his new crime plan, calling for more police. Gore said if he was elected president, his top priority (would be to) add a second cop to the Village People. Both groups are happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Also in Gore's $500 million crime plan, he called for drug testing of prison inmates. How does that work? Let's say they flunk the test. Do they go to prison?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush said he disagrees with this plan to drug test prison inmates. He says it would take three days for the results to come back.  And by that time, he has already executed the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;At a White House conference on teenagers, First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke of the pivotal period between childhood and responsible adulthood, or as Bill calls it -- 'My Presidency.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Everybody still talking about how funny President Clinton was at the White House correspondents dinner . He showed this video, maybe you saw it on the news. And in the video, they show Clinton with nothing to do. Like, he's sitting in a laundry room doing his laundry, watching laundry go around. Probably what happened was, I guess they realized Clinton had so many girlfriends while in office, they just installed the dry cleaner on the premises now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Secretary of State Madeline Albright today chewed out the entire State Department for not being careful enough with national security and top- secret files, pretty serious. She made a good point. She said, 'If we allow other countries to steal our most classified information, how are we supposed to sell it to the Chinese?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;She also said, from now on, we're not supposed to use the word 'password' as our password.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Newt Gingrich's lawyer announced that the former House Speaker plans to marry a former congressional aide this summer . This will be Newt's third wife. He wants to get married because I think he misses having somebody to cheat on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I saw one of these get-rich-quick things on TV . I guess what they do, they float you over to Miami on an inner tube, and five months later, they guarantee you'll be at an 1,100-acre estate in Maryland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian and his dad are down there on that estate. I guess they had kind of a rough day today. Apparently, the satellite dish went out. Couldn't get the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Fidel Castro called Elian Gonzalez's dad at the big estate down there in Maryland to ask him when he's coming back to Cuba . That must have been a great conversation. Elian's dad sitting on the patio with the mint julep, on the cell phone. 'When are we coming back, Fidel? I don't know. I think you must be going through a tunnel or something. Let me call you back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Janet Reno was on Oprah yesterday talking about the Elian Gonzalez case. And she went on Oprah because she doesn't want the coverage of this to turn into a media circus. I noticed, I was watching, she has brand new glasses. She got them in a pre-dawn raid on Lens Crafters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The President's African-American Secret Service agents have filed a discrimination suit against the government today, and the government says that the black agents just aren't working out, because every time someone yells 'get down,' they start dancing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges announced today they will merge, creating Europe's largest stock market. As of this afternoon, the price of stock in World War Three is through the roof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In response to anti-US protests, US warships have anchored off the island of Vieques. They'll stop using the island as a military facility if Puerto Rico agrees to take back Ricky Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The military is practicing on Vieques in hopes of someday invading neighboring Puerto Rico and rescuing America's hubcaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This 'I love you' virus. Isn't that something. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department threatens to split up Microsoft, now, all the computers are destroyed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the odds of that? Let me guess, for $49. 95, Gates has the only software that can fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What's going on with Elian 'The Great Gatsby' Gonzalez. He's getting used to that life of luxury down there in that 1,100-acre estate in Maryland. Costs us $1 million so far for this stupid thing. Like now, when Elian wants to go somewhere, I guess one of the servants blows up the inner tube for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich announced yesterday, later this summer he will marry the woman he was having an affair with while he was married. See, that's what the Republicans mean by family values. You marry the mistress you were cheating with. That's commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After a long standoff federal agents removed protesters at the Navy training base in Vieques, Puerto Rico. It went smoothly. After the incident, the US renamed the island France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher (show taped in an Arizona prison): &quot;This show we're doing tonight here, this is in lockdown. These are the guys who are bad, in prison. They're here for serious, serious crimes. For example, show of hands -- how many of you have sold drugs to Governor Bush?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody get infected by that e-mail virus. What do they call it? The 'I love you' virus. . The virus is so bad, Al Gore called a press conference to deny that he invented the internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Political experts said today that Hillary Clinton, the first lady, has been gaining votes. She's been doing better because she's been campaigning in remote regions that are usually ignored by politicians. That's her strategy, and it's working. . When asked about this, Hillary said, 'Believe me, I understand what it's like to have a region that's ignored by a politician.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm taking mom to see Gladiator. There's nothing like a violent Roman gladiator film, or as Janet Reno calls it, a date movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher (show taped in an Arizona prison): &quot;They have done everything they can here at the prison to make us feel right at home. . In fact, today, one of our cameramen joined the Aryan Brotherhood. . The initiation ceremony for them is tough, I tell you. First you gotta stab somebody. And then you gotta read Pat Buchanan's autobiography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;You know who's in here? Al Gore's old fundraising aide. And today I found out he's the bitch of George Bush's old coke dealer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This place really reminds me of the White House. Everyone claims to be innocent. There's a lot of illicit sex. And you spend your days picking up trash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Days after US marshals removed protesters from the military training ground at Vieques, Puerto Rico, one extreme protester, Tito De Jesus, is still hiding somewhere on the bombing range and has not been found, prompting Janet Reno to ask her agents, 'Did you check all the closets?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Thousands of gay men and women marched on Washington this week, demanding equal rights for same sex couples. At the event, marchers lauded President Clinton, saying that he has, 'Done more for homosexuals than any president in the past.' It's heterosexuality he's damaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;At the White House correspondents dinner last week, John McCain told Al Sharpton, 'I admire your style. I admire your passion.' Which means McCain stood up to five years of Vietnamese torture, but he's still afraid to tell a black guy what he really thinks of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;House Democrats filed suit against Tom DeLay alleging he oversees an organization that extorts campaign contributions. DeLay denied the accusations, but did agree to no longer send campaign contribution letters wrapped around a fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Quinn: &quot;Many health care plans across the country are now looking into alternative medicine as a way to find low-cost methods of treating patients. The number one alternative that health care plans are leaning towards? Pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Times is reporting that Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who, of course you know, is running against Hillary Clinton for the US Senate in New York, has stopped wearing his wedding ring. Not only that, they got pictures of him out on the town with a woman who is not his wife. Running against a Clinton? Now he is a Clinton.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an effort to keep his law license from being revoked, Bill Clinton says his testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case is not false as he defines the term. You've got to give him credit. See, to Clinton, the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, those are three different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The bookstore just came out with this to help you understand. It's the Clinton-to-English dictionary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What did I read today about Clinton? I guess he was in Arkansas over the weekend, he said one of his favorite things to do is get up early to go turkey hunting and 'hearing them turkeys sing.' That's what he said. You know he loves hearing that 'gobble-gobble' sound more than anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The winner of the Kentucky Derby was a horse named Fusaichi Pegasus. Sounds like an Al Gore campaign contributor, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore was talking about movies this past week. Do you know what he said his favorite movie of all time was? 'National Lampoon's Vacation. ' That's his favorite movie of all time, until the polls tell him differently.  But for now, that's his favorite movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's a book out now.called, 'How to Speak Dog.' It teaches you how to talk to dogs, or as Clinton calls it '101 Pickup Lines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was so hot today in New York City, Hillary Clinton is pretending to be a Canadian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was so hot today, New Yorkers were cooling off by huddling around Mayor Giuliani's marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was so hot today, Monica Lewinsky was selling shade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Cardinal John O'Connor, one of the great Catholics of our time, had his funeral in New York at St. Patrick's Cathedral. . The Clintons were there, the Gores were there, the Bushes were there. President Clinton was near tears. Not for the Cardinal. It had just been a long time since he had seen Hillary on her knees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was beautiful here in California today. But man, it was hot in the rest of the country. It was so hot in Texas, George Bush was frying inmates on the sidewalk.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier today, Senator John McCain officially endorsed George W. Bush for president. . They didn't look that comfortable. . McCain.looked like he did in those prisoner of war videos, you know, where he's blinking out the code. 'I'm here against my will! These bastards are holding me captive!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President and Mrs. Clinton spent a weekend with old friends in Little Rock, Arkansas, raising $100,000 for her New York Senate campaign. Kind of a switch. Usually, when Bill and Hillary get together with old friends in Arkansas, it's to help raise bail money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton revealed some of his future plans today. Listen to this, this is unbelievable. Until his apartment is ready at the Little Rock presidential library, until they build the apartment for him, he will live with his mother-in-law. Man, how bad have you screwed up if your wife makes you live with your mother-in-law?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said when Hillary is away, he sleeps in the bed with Buddy, the White House dog. Buddy the White House dog sleeps in the bed. Well, he got in that habit when Hillary banished him to the doghouse last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Buddy sleeps in the bed. How does that make Monica Lewinsky feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien : &quot;John McCain and George Dubyah Bush held a high-profile meeting. . After the meeting, McCain endorsed George W. Big story. Afterwards, Bush asked what endorse means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton said that since she's become a candidate, she and the President are now experiencing a role reversal. The first lady said that until she began her run for Senate, she had no idea there was 'so much sweet tail out there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Reasons John McCain Endorsed George W. Bush: 10. Setting record -- Endorsing most dumb rich white guys 9. The fact that people who don't endorse him often end up in the electric chair 8. Bush hinted might be able to bring back 'Beverly Hills 90210' 7. George W. has videotape of McCain partying with him in 1980s 6. Figured, 'What's the difference -- Gore's gonna whip him like a gimp donkey anyway' 5. The skip in his step, the twinkle in the eye...the man's in love! 4. Bush vowed to brush up on foreign leaders, like that French what's- his-face 3. Four horrendous years with Bush equals President McCain in 2004 2. Very persuasive argument presented by Bush's drug kingpin friends 1. Tired of Bush calling in middle of night screaming, 'Pleeeeease!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Despite past differences, former Republican candidate John McCain finally decided to throw his (support) to George W. Bush. McCain went outside and beat a reporter to death with a tire iron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;McCain said he had a change of heart after receiving several e-mails from Bush titled ILOVEYOU.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;John McCain has now officially endorsed George W. Bush for president. His quote was, 'I look forward to enthusiastically campaigning for George Bush.' The translation -- 'I will stop calling him a jackass at cocktail parties.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot in Pittsburgh, John McCain became delirious and accidentally endorsed George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Clinton Administration has unveiled a plan to preserve 43 million acres of American wilderness, all for Elian Gonzalez.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford joined President Clinton at the White House. Did you see the three of them on the news standing there together, Ford, Carter and Clinton? Kind of looked like the K-Mart version of Mount Rushmore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview, President Clinton said that when Hillary is in New York, when Hillary is not here, he lets Buddy the dog sleep in the bed. At least that's what he told Hillary about the scratches on his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember Paula Jones? Posing nude for 'Penthouse' magazine. I'm sorry, 'Outhouse' magazine. I think it's their special 'Girls of the Trailer Park' issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This would be a first for 'Penthouse.' Paula Jones would be the first 'Penthouse Pet' you could actually pass off as a pet&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I hope by doing this, she's not sending mixed signals to President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula Jones nude. We should sue her now for sexual harassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Paula Jones has agreed to do a nude photo spread for 'Penthouse.' When the magazine comes out, she's going to sue every man who looks at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Mayor Rudolf Giuliani.and his wife are splitting up? . Giuliani mention it in a press conference. He's got a good reason. He said now it's come to pass that his wife is starting to come between he and his girlfriend, so he had to make a decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Giuliani is now going to marry his girlfriend, so she'll be his new wife, and then he'll start looking for another girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The good news is now he is free to run for Senate against Hillary and maybe date her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Paula Jones.going to pose nude in 'Penthouse' magazine. She's doing it to kick her New York Senate campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Paula Jones in 'Penthouse.' What is the opposite of Viagra?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This poor girl is so trashy, it's hard to believe she didn't screw Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A new poll shows that George W. Bush has an imposing 8% lead over Al Gore. Bush has to be careful. With this much of an advantage he is dangerously close to having the government break him up into two smaller, weaker candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Paula Jones is supposedly in talks to pose naked in 'Penthouse' magazine. . It's believed Jones will be paid $100,000 to remove all of her clothes, $200,000 to remove all of her face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The first organizers have already arrived in Washington for the Million Mom March. . And President Clinton said today he fully supports a million women march on Washington. In fact, he said he once had a dream where that happened, but Hillary woke him up just when it was getting good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This wildfire is destroying the entire town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. And it was started on purpose. The fire service started this fire to clear some dry brush. And it got out of hand. They say this is the worst fire ever set by the Federal government not involving Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now there's a new plan to airlift Monica Lewinsky there to try to blow it out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;If you're worried about any of our nuclear secrets there at the Los Alamos lab, the Chinese scientists moved those months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scary moment today for George W. Bush on his campaign plane. A small fire broke out in the rear of the plane. Nobody was hurt, thankfully, but at one point the smoke inside the cabin got so thick, Bush thought he was back in his dorm room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore on the campaign trail yesterday, where he spoke to a group of Jewish activists. And you know Gore, I guess he told them he invented the bagel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula Jones.going to be posing naked in Penthouse magazine. I guess the deal is done, and in fact, right now, they're negotiating exactly what will be exposed. She wants to cover the area below the waist, and they want to cover the area above the neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said the pictures will be accompanied by an article that Paula will write herself about the hotel room incident with President Clinton.  In the article, she said she ran out of the room sobbing and got sick after Clinton exposed himself, which is pretty much the same reaction most people will have when they see her in the magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula said today the money from the photo shoot will go to a good cause. She wants to use the money to expand the front porch of her double-wide trailer so she can fit more dogs underneath there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;New York City Mayor Rudy 'Gigolo-ani' has announced that he is filing for separation from his wife. He thanked his wife for their years together and thanked President Clinton for making cheating fashionable again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's got to be a tough time for Giuliani, don't you think? I mean, he's running for the Senate and he's worried about losing the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Apparently, Giuliani was married once before to a woman who turned out to be his second cousin, but they had that marriage annulled. So apparently, he must have some Arkansas roots, too, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Elian Gonzalez's court case started today. . The big issue is whether or not a 6-year-old boy can have political beliefs strong enough to want asylum. . Apparently in a passionate speech, Elian said that he can't live under Castro because of the deplorable condition of Cuba's Pokemon cards. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At a conference on sex addiction, experts said that the Internet has caused a hypersexuality that is ruining Americans' marriages. In fact, they said the internet is almost as dangerous to marriage as being President of the United States or Mayor of New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I am Dave Letterman, your new Republican candidate for senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This just in. Rudy Giuliani is running for mayor of Splitsville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Let me see if I have this straight. So, Hillary Clinton now is the Senate candidate with the stable marriage, right? I tell you, politics is a crazy thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary is so confident now, she is raising cash legally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Mayor Giuliani said this whole thing has been painful. It's been painful to him, of course, and it's also painful to Hillary, because she wrenched her back earlier today doing cartwheels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They are saying now that Giuliani had two girlfriends. And I'm thinking: Two girlfriends? Come on. My God, President Clinton has two girlfriends before lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilburn: &quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani held a press conference yesterday where he announced he is separating from his wife. Apparently Rudy has been seeing other women. Asked why, the Mayor said, quote, 'Hey, I like to get my freak on.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Giuliani says that due to his problems he is expected to legally separate from his wife. He is also expected to drop out of the race for senator to run for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;If Rudy does drop out of the race for Senate, the Republican party says they have a candidate similar to the New York Mayor just waiting in the wings: Joseph Stalin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Mayor Giuliani in New York announced yesterday he is seeing another woman and seeking a separation from his wife. The guy who took all the sex out of Times Square has apparently put it in City Hall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Hillary is apparently very depressed about this. She said, 'If I wanted to spend the next six months battling an adulterer, I could've stayed home.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;If all this wasn't embarrassing enough for Republicans, when (Giuliani's) wife said, 'This is the last straw,' George Bush started rolling up a dollar bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Los Alamos, which is where our nuclear lab is -- not good. In fact, the damage there at the nuclear lab is so extensive that the Chinese have already been warned that our nuclear secrets might be a little late this month.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton today proposed some new laws for moms. He wants a guaranteed two-day stay in the hospital for moms having babies, guaranteed two-day stay. He feels this will provide more than enough time for the fathers to get out of town.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton.hasn't decided what he's going to do when he leaves office. He says he'll find something useful to do, because he's always enjoyed every stage of his life. Every stage? He never made it past adolescence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula Jones is going to be posing nude in Penthouse magazine. Just because Clinton did something wrong, why should we all be punished?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why would anybody pay five bucks to see Paula Jones naked in a magazine. For five bucks, you can probably get the real Paula Jones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The editors of Penthouse said today the pictures they're going to shoot are very natural, very natural. The only thing they're going to airbrush in will be some teeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Little change in Giuliani's platform. . Remember, a couple weeks ago, he said he wanted to post the Ten Commandments in every classroom? Well, now he's just down to nine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Mayor of New York is in a big sex scandal. In fact, Hillary Clinton said today this is so embarrassing for New Yorkers, she's glad she doesn't really live there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton, the first lady, said that out of respect, she wishes reporters would stop asking Mayor Giuliani about his marriage problems. . Meanwhile, Giuliani's wife said that out of respect, she wishes President Clinton would stop calling her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Right here on CBS was the 49th Miss Universe Pageant, earlier tonight. The winner, of course, gets a scholarship, jewelry, and a night on the town with Mayor Rudy Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's been kind of a bad week for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. First his wife throws him out. Twenty minutes later, he's arrested by the police for being homeless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They announced that the marriage was over, and immediately after the announcement, Rudy went down to Times Square and reopened all the strip clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Say what you will about Hillary, she doesn't let a little thing like a girlfriend get in the way of her marriage, does she?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After a political rival revealed Rudy Giuliani has a mistress, the New York Mayor held a press conference to take questions on his political future. Though Giuliani's politics have always divided people, they can all agree on one thing: This chick is slightly hotter than Monica Lewinsky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In Branton, Florida, hundreds have lined up to see what they believe is the image of Jesus Christ on the side of a church. . Later, Janet Reno sent in armed guards to return him to Heaven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Preparations are under way in Washington, D.C. for this weekend's Million Mom March. President Clinton said the government can't look the other way when this many people march, especially when they have two million breasts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You feel so sorry for those poor people down there who lost their homes in New Mexico. . They call it a 'controlled burn.' You know what this is, a controlled burn? That's what John McCain does every time he has to say he's supporting George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore spoke at Beaver College in Pennsylvania today, which I think is Clinton's alma mater, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Things were pretty dull here in New York City over the weekend. It's been 24 hours since we've had a startling announcement from Mayor Rudy Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now the Mayor is saying that next week he'll decide whether or not he's running for the Senate. See, here's the problem. We're six months into the campaign, and he hasn't decided whether he's going to run yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday Giuliani was out playing golf. That's unbelievable to me. I mean, he's having an affair, he's playing golf. This guy doesn't want to be senator; this guy wants to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush wants to change Social Security to make sure that senior citizens never have to worry about money in their golden years. Critics say it's an obvious attempt to lock up the Aerosmith vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A whole lot of women marched into Washington, D.C., yesterday to protest guns and gun violence in the Million Mom March, or as President Clinton called it, the St. Booty's Day parade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Million Mom March coincided with the Million Dad March - - to Blockbuster's adult section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Not surprisingly, after about one hour the million moms suddenly changed their minds and began demanding less gun control. That's chicks for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush unveiled a plan today to privatize Social Security by investing in the market, part of his plan to ensure that every senior citizen in America dies completely broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was reported today that Rudy Giuliani dropped out of the New York Senate race.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This is the big TV week of the spring. This is the big finales week. . For example this is the big finale for 'ER.' This is the big finale for 'Friends.' And this is the big finale for the Giuliani marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Poor Rudy, he's having a bad week. He didn't even get an adultery bump in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you, if the election was held tomorrow, would vote for Al Gore? How many of you, if the election was held tomorrow, would vote for George W. Bush? How many of you, if the election was held tomorrow, would be really surprised that they were having an election in May?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Apparently, Al Gore, in the polls, he does not attract -- women are not attracted to Al Gore. That's a big problem for him. But you know, on the other hand, I am thinking to myself, ladies and gentlemen, after all we have been through, isn't that a positive thing, really, when you think about it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush yesterday outlined his proposal for modifying the Social Security system by investing in the stock market. . Asked how he plans to do it, Bush said, 'Hey, look, it's Elvis' and then ran away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a move to slow down the red-hot economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hiked interest rates today. He also plans to raise bond rates, print more money, get drunk and slap a few strippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;If the rate hike fails to slow down the economy, Greenspan said he'll have no option but to inject the economy with pure Turkish heroin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Unknown child actor Felix has been picked to play Elian Gonzalez in a new movie about the Cuban boy. Playing Janet Reno -- Nick Nolte. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Mayor Rudy Giuliani told the press yesterday despite his health and marital woes he's still very much inclined to run for Senate. Experts feel that statement can only mean one thing -- Rudy Giuliani is not going to run for Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Getting involved in crooked land deal, not letting your friends join in 5. Taking too long with closing statement, forgetting courthouse turns into pool hall at 5 4.

Too much fancy book-learnin'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a startling 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has made adult material on cable more accessible to subscribers. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? You are if you're thinking: 'Way to go, Clarence Thomas!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: There is an upside to not being a lawyer anymore. Clinton can join the rest of us in hating lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Supreme Court -- highest court in the land -- struck down a law requiring adult cable channels to block the signals. That was a big victory for the Playboy Channel. . It was a very close decision -- 5-4. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion. Justice Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion. And Clarence Thomas wrote a fan letter to Christy Canyon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;An Arkansas court recommended that President Clinton be disbarred. Yeah, he was apparently a disgrace on the profession of Arkansas lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Now, this is very bad news for Clinton. Not that he really wanted to be a lawyer after he got out of office. But he was planning on saving a few bucks by handling his own divorce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Good news for Hillary Clinton -- of course, running in the Senate. No longer against Rudy Giuliani, who dropped out. And over the weekend we saw who the new opponent is -- Rick Lazio. We don't know much about him. But, apparently, he is more liberal than Giuliani. For example, he supports a woman's right to choose. Whereas Giuliani supports his right to choose a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The fisherman. . The one, yes, with Elian Gonzalez, he is suing the government for $100 million. Apparently they violated his fourth amendment rights. And it's a great precedent he's going to set, because, if an American cannot have privacy in a closet with some other country's orphans, what's gonna happen to Woody Allen?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They're expecting the biggest fund-raiser ever in Washington, D.C. . They expect to rake in $25 million. Clinton, I tell ya, he is the all-time champion. They say, since '92, he's raised over $1 billion for the Democrats. I don't know how to explain this, except to say this guy has a knack for getting people to put out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Also in politics today, presidential primaries in Washington, D.C. . Marion Barry said he was conflicted about this. He's torn, because he says Gore is better on civil rights, but Bush has a stronger record of being high on crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The NRA just finished their big convention. I'm sure you heard, Charlton Heston, they gave him another term there as the grand Poo-Bah, and they were there at a hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, for a while. And they left today. And I think they got a little cocky, because they passed a resolution saying 'Guns don't kill people, but they sure do help when you're arguing about your Spectravision charges with the hotel staff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night President Clinton and Al Gore hosted a fundraiser that broke all fundraising records. Raised more than $26 million in one night. You know, I had no idea there were that many Buddhist nuns in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, they raised so much money, today Al Gore was talking to the Chinese about trying to buy out his contract, you know, work out some new kind of deal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who the entertainment was? It was Darius Rucker, from Hootie &amp; the Blowfish. Which -- with all the Clintons' problems -- do you really want a band with the name 'Blowfish?' I mean, whose idea was this? Were the Cherry Poppin' Daddies not available?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know, the House has passed that big trade bill that makes China a normal trading partner with the US. And what a proud moment for us. From now on, when China runs over student demonstrators, it will be with American made tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Elian Gonzalez has been out of the news for a couple of days.  I guess he's in his place up the Hamptons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Elian Gonzalez and his dad now are expected to be moved from their secluded Maryland retreat. They're going to be at a big estate in Washington, DC, to be closer to the malls to do some shopping. You know, I haven't seen a communist live this well since Jane Fonda married Ted Turner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;An article in People magazine claims that Vice President Gore -- listen to this -- has been trying out a brand new pressurized makeup applicator, which is also used by Catherine Zeta Jones. That's the truth. Yeah. Yeah, and, apparently it must be working, because yesterday, Gore was proposed to by Michael Douglas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Democrats took in over $25 million at an event which featured stars like Lenny Kravitz and Ronin Williams. That amount would have been lower, but one donor pledged $20 million if Robin Williams would shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After eight years in office, Clinton said what historians are now saying is the only sincere thing he's ever said.&quot; (Video of Clinton saying:) &quot;I'm just an old gray-haired red neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The US Mint unveiled its newly designed $5 and $10 dollar bills. . The Mint will gather up billions of the old bills and make them disappear by investing them in the NASDAQ.&quot;</SPAN></P>

All these guys with fake badges got into 19 sensitive Federal Buildings -- the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon. In the Justice Department, they walked right into Janet Reno's office.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Paula Jones says that she lives in fear that once Clinton is out of office, he will have her killed. I think this is a very lame attempt on her to get the Federal Witness Protection Program to pay for her nose job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton has been in Russia for the last couple of days. I guess he didn't want to go, but apparently Russia was the last country he needed to complete his 'Panties From Around the World' set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More problems for Al Gore. It seems a Tennessee woman who lives in a house owned by the Vice President is claiming Gore is a 'Slumlord' because of the broken toilets and the lack of hot water. Imagine that, Al Gore as a slum lord. Boy, you thought they were stealing Republican ideas before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Washington Post reported today that George W. Bush has formed his own think tank to come up with policy ideas for his presidential campaign. George W. Bush in a think tank. George, some advice -- stay in the shallow end!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems yesterday, a sex offender.made a daring escape in Florida when a helicopter dropped down in the prison yard. This is really something. Do we have footage of that sex offender making his escape on the helicopter? Show that footage:&quot; (Video of Clinton boarding Marine One)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day in Australia, a horny crocodile started humping a sea plane and did thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of damage to the aircraft. And, folks, as weird as that story is, a similar thing once happened on Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you have Senate campaign fever? First you have Hillary, and then you have Rick Lazio. Rick Lazio -- he's the flight attendant who forgets to give you the change for the headphones?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Rick Lazio - isn't he the guy in Chopper 2 above the 405 reporting the traffic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;We've had a lot of rain here in New York City. . It was raining so hard Mayor Giuliani and his girlfriend had to humiliate his wife indoors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Defense Department said that due to a clerical error.they exaggerated the Korean War deaths by 15,000. . So the Pentagon today sent out 15,000 letters to war widows saying, 'Good news, your husband is alive -- but he's living with a woman named Kim Su.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Al Gore is in trouble. . In Carthage, Tennessee, he has, I guess, he has some sort of an apartment building and the tenants today are calling him a 'Slumlord.' Al Gore a 'Slumlord'? They said there's overflowing toilets, backed-up sinks. I tell ya, of the two of them, I thought Bush would certainly be the one running the crack house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Did you watch the Tonys? Me, neither. But critics are calling it New York's most entertaining night of tears and tap dancing since mayor Rudy Giuliani's last press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, a federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft. That's amazing, isn't it? Eight years ago, who would have thought Microsoft would be split up and the Clintons still be together?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We've got our own 'Survivor Show' here at NBC. Apparently a group of people will try to survive for one month living in one of Al Gore's rental properties.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The latest rumor is Jerry Springer may be getting back into politics. . In fact, this is going to be the first campaign in history where the lone nut in the crowd is the candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A federal judge has ruled that sodomy is illegal in Utah. I guess you can rule out a presidential visit to that state, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A new book that just came out this week called 'The Scarlet Thread'.ranks President Kennedy as the fifth most immoral president and Bill Clinton as the number one most immoral president. Although it works out even. Though President Kennedy had more girlfriends, I guess pound-for-pound, Clinton was still ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A new political party being formed called the Outlaw Party that has a $400 war chest, and it's main goal is legalizing marijuana. Unfortunately, this afternoon, they spent all $400 on Oreo cookie ice cream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a new poll that just came out, 50% of Americans say that at some point in their lives, they were spanked by their parents. The other 50% say that at some point in their lives, they were spanked by President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I heard that President Clinton.is getting nostalgic and thoughtful -- reflective about his time in office. Earlier today, he called Joe Lockhart into the Oval Office and he reenacted the Kathleen Willey grope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He sits around all day watching impeachment highlights videos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Also today, he reenacted moving Vince Foster's body to the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then today he held a big intern reunion under his desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A federal judge today ruled that Microsoft must be split up into two companies. Bill Gates is so depressed he said he feels like a million bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Gates plans to call the two companies 'Judges' and 'Suck.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush.got an endorsement from McCain, in a way. For the first time, McCain has come out and said that he has agreed for the sake of the party that he would pee on Bush if his ass was on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Lakers defeated the Pacers, 104-87. I don't want to say the game was one sided, but this morning, a federal judge declared the Lakers a monopoly and ordered them broken up into two teams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Another hot day around the country. Boy, I'll tell ya, it was hot. People were sweating like Al Gore at a landlord/tenant meeting.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Vice President was called a slumlord by a tenant who was renting a place from him, because the tenant claimed there was no hot water, and the toilets are backed up. In fact, when President Clinton heard about Al Gore's rental properties, he was pretty shocked. He said, 'Al, I didn't know you had a place on the side. I could have been using that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Washington Post says that George W. Bush has formed his own think tank -- George W. Bush and a think tank? Let's hope there's a lifeguard on duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;A federal judge ruled that Microsoft should be split into two different companies. This is how it's going to work. One company will manufacturer the windows operating system, and the other company will count Bill Gates' money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that over the next 10 years, Microsoft should be divided into two separate companies. You know what that means, don't you? Neither do I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Judge Jackson is giving Microsoft four months to come up with their own break-up plan or a very large bribe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Microsoft chairman Bill Gates took the news well, and is expected to spend the rest of his life trying to make his untalented wife into an opera singer before retiring to a secluded mansion and croaking out the word 'Rosebud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Microsoft employees reacted to the ruling by playing hours of Dungeons and Dragons and getting really buzzed on Mountain Dew.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Our good buddy, San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, will announce his retirement from football on Monday, based on his doctor's advice.  He's gonna retire. Yeah. And he's a good guy. And what, he suffered four concussions over the past year. Doctors said today, one more concussion, he could end up a Reform Party candidate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A Texas appeals court has ruled that sodomy is now legal in that state. Sodomy is legal. And in fact, did you see the official reaction today? Show the reaction.&quot; (President Clinton was shown, applauding.) &quot;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, go for it! Whoo-wee! We're going to Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, I saw something sad, coming in to work today. I'm driving down Ventura Boulevard, went by a store, and in the window I saw Bill Gates working, fixing old Atari video games for 5 bucks an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The new movie 'Gone in 60 Seconds' opened tonight. It's all about how long George W. Bush would last on 'Jeopardy!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, and this 'Survivor' TV show, man, this thing is a huge hit. It's beating Regis now, this &quot;Survivor' thing. You know how it works? They put 16 people on a tropical island for like, 15 weeks. And each week the group votes someone off. And the last person wins a million bucks. You know what I say? Forget the cash. This is how we should pick our President. You know what I mean? You drop Bush, you drop Gore off on the island. Come back in six months, whichever one's still alive, fine, you're the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The New York Daily News said, Monica Lewinsky will soon be coming out with her own line of perfume. I think it only attracts married men, a little different than regular perfume. I think it comes in a squirt bottle, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I'm surprised - you'd think she'd come out with something a little more up her alley, like mouthwash. Maybe that would be more appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George W. Bush, who is running -- the little Bush kid, running for President -- and his advisers, they are going this weekend for a retreat at his parent's house. Remember George Sr. had that house in Kennebunkport, Maine. Well, they are all going up there to the big compound. And this is good. This will give George W. a chance to reconnect with his dad. Because they have not really bonded since the '80s, when they used to throw up together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Over the weekend, President Assad of Syria passed away. Now they've nominated his son to succeed him as President. Of course, it's silly to assume just because the guy was a good president, that his son would also make a good president. Thank God nothing like that can ever happen in this country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, thank God for that. I think his son is George W. Assad, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said today in the paper his death could cause problems for reaching a peace agreement in the Middle East. Yeah, things were going so well up to this point. It's a shame this had to happen. Two- thousand years of peace, and then this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Money Magazine just came out with the annual list of the best places to live in America. Among the best places -- Bend, Oregon, Fort Collins, Colorado, Bradenton, Florida. Worst place to live, anybody know? No? One of Al Gore's rental properties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you hear about this story? My favorite story of the week: Al Gore was called a slumlord last week after tenants in an apartment building that he owns in Tennessee.complained there was no running water, and there were no working toilets. No running water and no toilets. You know what they call that in Tennessee? The 'Four Seasons Hotel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore said today he's rooting for the Lakers in the NBA finals.  Well, duh, Indiana only has 12 electoral votes. California's got 54. No politics there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Pat Buchanan's running for president. You know who he's considering as a running mate? Doctor Laura Schlessinger. A Buchanan- Schlessinger ticket. How about that? The man who admires Hitler and a Jew. Boy, that's a balanced ticket, isn't it, pretty much? Good thinking there. Apparently, his first choice, Dr. Mengele, not available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a recent survey, a majority of Americans believe that committing adultery should not disqualify someone from holding political office. I think this poll was done twice before, wasn't it? It was called the last presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Clinton delivered a joke-filled monologue to reporters on Saturday. . The highlight of the evening was a joke which began, 'Ladies don't you hate it when you're beating your husband with a lamp and you get tackled by four Secret Service agents?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary.unveiled a new slogan: 'Vote For Me Or I'll Do More Jokes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's see what's going on at the Los Alamos nuclear lab, or as the Clinton Administration calls it, 'Chinese takeout,' yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, it seems some highly classified top secret documents are missing from the Los Alamos lab. See, you know what the problem is -- they always classify these documents 'top secret.' I mean, if you see something that says 'Top Secret,' what do you do? You know, put 'Transcripts of Al Gore's Speeches' on the front, you know? No one is going to be thumbing through there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, officials at Los Alamos said they have ruled out espionage. Do you really want to rule out espionage? Because that just leaves plain incompetence, doesn't it? Wouldn't you rather say, 'Oh, they had some really good spy in here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;An Pat Buchanan announced that homophobic talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger is on his short list to be his possible running mate for President of the US. This is true. They talked about this on the news tonight.  Dr. Laura running with Buchanan. One commentator said, 'Well, there goes the gay vote.' Oh, yeah, and Pat had the gay vote sewn up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you something, I think if you're gay, you should support this ticket. I mean, what better way to make sure nobody ever hears of Dr. Laura again, than to make her vice president of the US?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I saw 'Price is Right' host Bob Barker testifying. He's for animal rights and things. There's a new bill in Congress to make it illegal to use elephants in circuses or as amusement rides. Elephants would not be allowed anymore to be used for amusement purposes. Hey, there goes the White House intern program, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of people talking about 'Gone in 60 Seconds,' which I believe, is the average life span of a Texas death row inmate, isn't it now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: PBS &quot;had an interesting show on last night called the '1900 House' -- now, this is pretty cool --where a modern family in England, a modern family of five, lives in a home, and it's just as it was in the year 1900. No modern conveniences at all. In fact, I think the family is renting the place from Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think it's one of his properties. There's no electricity, there's no running water, no car, no radio, no TV, or as they call the show in Cuba, 'Futurama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;When asked yesterday, George W., or 'W.,' said a moratorium on the death penalty is not needed in Texas. Yeah, that's what he said. However, George W. said he might take some time off to find out what the word 'moratorium' means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that Pat Buchanan is considering asking Dr. Laura Schlessinger to be his running mate because he agrees with her anti- gay views. That's what he said. Yeah, and when asked if he's considering any male running mates, Buchanan said, 'Hey, I'm no homo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Syrian President Assad died last week. And you know who was most devastated by his passing? George W. Bush. George W. Bush, yeah. Not because he was close to Assad or anything. It's just last week, he finally learned the President of Syria's name. And now -- now the guy's dead. Great! All that work for nothing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, he got quite a shock on the campaign trail the other day. You know, they're using this trick where they go and they stay in different people's houses as he travels around to meet average Americans. I guess he was staying overnight the other night with a poor family who is living in substandard housing. It turns out it was one of his tenants. How embarrassing is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And yesterday, the MacArthur foundation awarded their annual genius grants. Have you heard about this group?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It seems two computer hard drives containing, like, top secret weapons information are missing from the lab, just missing. Isn't that unbelievable? I mean, the one thing the National Park Service didn't manage to burn down, and it winds up getting stolen. I mean, what are the odds of that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the official policy.at Los Alamos, when something is discovered missing, they're supposed to report it within eight hours. Three weeks it took these people. Three weeks. And apparently people could come and go from the lab just without signing . I mean, even at Blockbuster, you have to show the membership card, don't you? And two forms of ID? It's actually harder to rent 'Beast Master.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And like most of the world, I was shocked when I heard this today -- Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco getting a divorce. And now that it appears her marriage to a lying, cheating adulterer is over, Mary Jo said she would take the next likely step -- you know, running for Senate in New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the American Film Institute has come out with list of the 100 funniest films of all time. They had a special on TV last night about it. And they had a clip of the funniest film clip of the last 100 years. And I gotta tell you, boy, it killed me. I had forgotten all about this. Did anybody see the show last night? I guess this was voted the funniest single film clip of all time. Show that footage there.&quot; (Video of President Clinton: ) &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Vice President Al Gore has kicked off his 'Progress and Prosperity' tour. And you thought this summer was going to be dull!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;'Progress and Prosperity.' . His campaign slogan is from the '39 World's Fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Congress is going to pass a law banning elephants from being in the circus. Hey, if you want to ban something, how about Roseanne posing nude for Playboy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The first-ever summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea got underway. The leaders said they were committed to ending over 50 years of hostility.you know, if it doesn't get in the way of watching 'Survivor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The talks are expected to go on until there is a reconciliation, or until Korean officials give up trying to pronounce 'reconciliation.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;North Korea hopes that an ease in tensions will attract Western franchises to their nation. Top on the list: 'Supercuts.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After a recent rash of severe brush fires, two computer drives containing nuclear secrets are missing from the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. Security agents at the lab became suspicious when they realized that the entire town of Los Alamos was now only ten miles from Beijing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In 'this is gonna be good' news, according to the latest polls in New York City, senate hopeful, Rick Lazio is in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton. Political analysts attribute Lazio's startling success to his youth, his eagerness, and the fact that he's not Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Los Alamos -- I don't know what the security is over there, but it's not that good. We seem to have misplaced two hard drives with all of our nuclear secrets on them. The only clue is a kind of a cryptic e-mail from Seattle that said, 'If you know what's good or you, leave Microsoft alone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The North and the South of Korea finally got together today 50 years after the war, the two Kims got together, which is a good thing. . The heads of the countries.got together and they seem to be getting along very well, which is good because last year, you know, they had a fierce naval skirmish over fishing rights. They almost went to war over fish, these two countries. I'll tell you, if they would have found Elian Gonzalez, we would have had World War III.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The president of Argentina was in Washington today with President Clinton apologizing, finally, again 50 years too late, for harboring Nazi war criminals, which they did, Argentina. We know that. And this president, good for him, he said we should never have let in people like Adolf Eichmann and Dr. Joseph Mengele, especially Mengele, he was a terrible doctor. You'd ask him for a second opinion and he'd say, 'The Jews are an inferior race.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, big shakeup in the Gore campaign. Tony Coelho -- out. He's gone. And Commerce Secretary William Daley is in. Coelho says he's resigning because he has an inflamed colon. I think it's from getting their asses kicked in the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush's handlers, giving him some advice for his campaign. This is what they're telling him. This was in the paper today. They're telling Bush he should remind voters of his record as Governor of Texas and that he should act tough or he'll be labeled a wimp. I think he took the advice. See those new Bush bumper stickers? 'Vote for me or I'll execute you.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here is a very disturbing story. It seems a retired Army colonel, I think the highest ranking guy to ever be charged with this, has been charged with selling military secrets to the Soviet Union. How stupid are those Russians. Why pay good money to a Colonel for nuclear secrets when he could just go down to Los Alamos and pick them up for free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you know how Los Alamos -- know how the lab lost their secrets? You know how they lost it? Anybody hear it? Apparently they had the Pacers guarding them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You've been reading about this Los Alamos lab? What's going on? This place is about secure as Clinton's zipper, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I guess they're starting to take action. Like today they're thinking of putting a 7-Eleven in Los Alamos, so this way they will at least have some security cameras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess members of Congress are demanding answers. Yesterday they wanted to know why these workers were so slow in reporting these secrets being stolen. And today they're even more upset because they didn't get any answers. Isn't this amazing? The only government in the world who can't get information out of Los Alamos, and it's ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, the big show everybody is talking about now, this CBS show 'Survivor.' . You know what's interesting about this show - they finished taping it months ago. Hundreds of people know the outcome -- technicians, camera people. Nobody can find out who won. Nobody can find out even who the next person to be kicked off will be next week. You know what we should do? We should get the staff in charge of the Survival show and put them in charge of Los Alamos. They couldn't do any worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore has kicked off his 'Progress and Prosperity' tour.  I hope it works better for Al than it did for Wendell Wilkie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The meeting of the two Koreas has come to an end. The two Koreas agreed they would say hello around the office, but they won't be going out together for beers after work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The big development is the two Koreas have agreed to reunite for one night only in Central Park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hilary Clinton laid into opponent Rick Lazio, saying he is a follower, not a leader. Asked for his reaction, Lazio said, 'I don't know. What do you guys think?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The big story is still the Los Alamos scandal, you know, two full computer hard drives full of our sensitive nuclear weapons data have disappeared. At this point really, our only military secrets are if a soldier is gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The security at this lab was absolutely terrible. Government inspectors, in fact, today found a note on the refrigerator of the employee lounge that said: 'Please take home your leftover plutonium'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's another tip -- job counselors are saying if you ever worked as a security guard at Los Alamos nuclear facility, please leave it off your resume. Not a good idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know about how some of those computer hard drives are missing. I guess they found them. They were recovered today. Well, that's good that they were recovered. I guess these things have all kinds of information on them about our weapons and all kinds of top-secret stuff. But they're only about the size of a pack of cards. You could put them right in your pocket. See, you would have thought they would have some security. You know, like chain them to a hubcap or a block of wood -- like they do at the gas station bathrooms -- you don't see anybody walking off with that big key.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gas prices going up. You know what it is in Chicago now? They showed this on the news today. Full service Chicago -- $2.69 a gallon. Isn't that amazing? How do you think the oil companies are laughing now at Microsoft? 'So they thought you had a monopoly?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Federal agents this week broke up what they're calling one of the biggest heroin rings in America. They actually broke it into two smaller rings -- one to grow it, one to sell it, because heroin monopolies are against the law. So they had to split it into two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Remember we talked about this all week -- Beaver College, Beaver College in Philadelphia, forced to change it's name. Yes. Apparently President Clinton wants to use that name for his Presidential Library. Yeah. So apparently it's got to go now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it seems a lot of country clubs around the Clintons' New York home. . The country clubs there said they probably would not want President Clinton as a member. They gave two reasons, they said because security would be disrupted, and also they don't know where his putter has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;On a recent campaign flight, George W. Bush told reporters that he had never even heard of Leonardo DiCaprio. That's what he said. Yeah, yeah, then -- then Bush said, 'But that's not unusual, I'm not familiar with a lot of European leaders.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's some insight regarding Father's Day. Dad does not want a tie. Dad does not want Old Spice. Dad wants his own intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They're going to pass a law here in New York City for some sort of fire- proof cigarette. . What that means is if you don't suck on it, the flame dies. That's also how you describe a Clinton relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, wasn't it another hot day. Man, I tell you, I was sweating like Bill Clinton on Father's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's so hot in Texas, people down there were visiting death row just to feel that breeze coming off the revolving door.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess George W. Bush is handling it now by telling them that he has to act tough, or else he's going to be labeled a wimp. Act tough? They've executed, what, 134 people? How much tougher can he be? Whose record is he going for, Stalin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore's former campaign manager, Tony Coelho, has stepped down because of an inflamed colon. Which is kind of ironic because this guy was hired to light a fire under Al Gore's butt. He winds up with the inflamed colon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see Al Gore on Barbara Walters Friday night? It was riveting! . My favorite part when she asked him the famous question she always asks, she said, 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' And Al Gore got mad. He said, 'What do you mean, if I were a tree?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;'Forbes' magazine, I guess, has once again named Bill Gates richest man in the world. In fact, on hearing this, Janet Reno said today that Mr. Gates should be broken into two smaller rich men so as to eliminate a monopoly on that title.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you excited about Al Gore? He got a new campaign manager. Yeah, Bill Daley. And they say this is the guy that's going to put the excitement and the enthusiasm in the Al Gore...and I'm thinking to myself, 'Well, hell, why don't they just run this guy? Huh? If he's that exciting and enthusiastic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Gore, you know.people perceive him as being kind of rigid, kind of stiff, and he's always trying to, you know, show them that that's not true, that he's exciting and loose. He's changed his name now to Tiger Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Did you see 'Shaft' over the weekend? Big movie. You know, President Clinton, we know, is quite a film buff, and over the weekend he got a bunch of interns together in the Oval Office. And he showed them the original 'shaft.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;According to Newsweek magazine, Hillary Clinton wants to be the first female President of the US. Husband Bill is all for a woman president, saying it will finally give male interns a chance to get groped.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, a lot of officials condemned what happened last night (after the Lakers won the NBA Championship). In fact, today, George W. Bush called for the death penalty for all Laker fans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In a historic decision yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that public schools cannot allow students to lead crowd in prayers before football games. However, they did say any New Orleans Saints crowds must pray before the game, because that's pretty much the only chance they have of winning.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Earlier this week, Al Gore's former campaign manager Tony Coelho stepped down. He stepped down because he had an inflamed colon. Now please, do not confuse this with presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who is an inflamed colon. That is a totally different -- that is a totally different -- totally different thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More news from the Los Alamos nuclear facility. It seems two employees in that lab there have been flown to Washington today because they reportedly failed the lie detector test. . These guys failed the lie detector test, and they took them to Washington, because apparently, that's where we keep all our liars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Got the latest in the campaign news? George W. Bush -- I call him 'Dubyah' -- George W. Bush accused Al Gore of copying his plan to save Social Security. That's right. And actually -- actually, Gore may have copied Bush's plan, because Gore's plan has the exact same spelling mistakes. 'Tax' does not have a 'k.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Right after winning the US Open the other day, Tiger Woods received a phone call from President Clinton. That's right. And reportedly, the President told Tiger, 'I would love to join you in a foursome sometime. I'd also like to play golf with you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A Reform Party staffer has called Pat Buchanan a racist, a sexist and a homophobe. On the upside, Pat has a new campaign slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They finally found those hard drives at Los Alamos over the weekend. Did you see that? They lost those hard drives with all our nuclear information on it. They found them behind the copy machine. . And, of course, the politicians are already making hay out of this. George Bush - - the little Bush kid running for president -- he said, 'America's nuclear security is not a matter of lost and found.' . He said he's never even lost his own car keys, although he has had them taken away a number of times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The London Times is reporting that George W. Bush in 1972, when he was in the air National Guard, was grounded because he refused to take a drug test. And I think the military brass had an inkling that he was on the junk because he used to brag that he did more between midnight and 4: 00 A.M. than most people do all day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;A very important ruling from the Supreme Court. They said a public high school student may not -- may not, lead other students in prayer before a football game. . Clarence Thomas on the court weighed in. He said this would absolutely violate the separation of church and state to have prayer before the game, and it also might make our cheerleaders less likely to put out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;After what happened Monday night&quot; after the LA Lakers won the NBA finals &quot;officials now are concerned because the Democratic convention is going to be held there in less than two months. In less than two months, the Democratic convention. They don't want the same thing happening. The chance of Al Gore whipping that crowd in a frenzy? They're going to riot? I would be more worried about people walking around half asleep getting hit by cars.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now they're getting tough with the oil companies. Al Gore getting tough. Al Gore said today that big oil was trying to get fat off the backs of Americans. As opposed to President Clinton, who tries to get fat Americans on their backs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bumped into Al Gore last night. He was in Kinko's copying George W. Bush's Social Security plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually today George W. Bush revealed his latest plan to save Social Security. It won't cost a dime. This new plan, execute people before they get to Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Family Circle magazine, now having a contest between Tipper Gore and Laura Bush to see which next First Lady has the best cookie recipe. Huh? Who says women aren't progressing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You want a great dessert, try the George W. Bush special brownies -- one bite and you can't even remember the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, George W. Bush, or as I call him, 'Dubyah' -- Dubyah said that there is no good reason why the US is second to last in standardized test scores. He's mad about this. Yeah, yeah, W. Bush said, 'It is appalling that the only country to score below us is that one next to the country shaped like a boot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Immediately after winning at the US Open the other day, Tiger Woods received a call on his cell phone from President Clinton. That was very cool. Yeah, but the President may have too much time on his hands, because he called Shaq after the Lakers won, and earlier tonight, he called the winner on 'Hollywood Squares.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton is looking for a home in England. . Clinton says he has some unfinished business in England -- inhaling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;We try to point out political correctness and stamp it out. Now, it's spread to the State Department. There are no more rogue states, you know, we have used that term for decades, rogue states, meaning the bad guys like Libya and Iraq and Iran and Syria, North Korea, Cuba -- the bad guys who terrorize and bomb us. Well, apparently we don't want to hurt their feelings. So now we're calling them 'countries of concern.' And if they act up, from now on, instead of like intervening and bombing them or sending troops, we're just going to have them take a timeout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The London press is reporting that President Clinton -- get this -- is shopping for a home after his presidency in England near Oxford, where he went to school. Apparently two reasons -- one, he is considering a teaching job there at Oxford. And two, it's about as far away he can get from Hillary without learning a new language.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, George W. Bush, taking some criticism for his death penalty policy. In fact, this guy has executed so many people -- you heard his new campaign slogan? 'I see dead people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well look, you got Gore and Bush. But at least when Gore puts you to sleep, you wake up again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, and the state of Florida, they convicted a guy, convicted murderer got executed yesterday -- little Freudian slip. You know, Florida is the home of Governor Jeb Bush, brother of George W. Bush. He executed a guy yesterday, Texas allegedly doing it today. Sounds like a little sibling rivalry between the two brothers, huh? Kind of a 'Death Race 2000' thing going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Hillary Clinton, of course, is running a new campaign ad. She's got a new campaign ad that people are talking about that features the slogan 'Trust me.' That's her slogan. Yeah, and actually, it's much better than the original version, 'Hillary, the Clinton you can trust.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's how 'Survivor' works. Each week, they vote someone off the island. It's kind of like the Al Gore campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's the first day of summer. It was so nice today, George W. Bush down in Texas was holding executions outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, let's see what's going on in Texas. They now call it 'Survivor, the Home Game.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, that's a tough town, Texas. Isn't it? In by 9:00, dead by 5: 00. That's pretty much the way it works.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, you heard Texas' new motto -- 'Next!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So, you got George W. Bush executing people in Texas. You got his brother Jeb executing people from Florida. They got the Bush brothers -- these guys are starting to sound like the Menendez brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of people who oppose capital punishment think these executions should be televised. If you put them on television, people will be so shocked by what they see, they'll turn against it. And that works so well with violence, drugs and teenage sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here is an interesting political rumor. I don't know if it's true or not, but it's popping up on CNN and MSNBC. Jesse Ventura may be on Al Gore's short list as a vice presidential candidate. That would be a good team.  Yeah. Jesse 'The Body' Ventura with Al 'the Dead Body' Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The price of gas keeps going up. . And it's starting to affect the way people date, too. In fact, Monica Lewinsky now even more popular just for her ability to siphon. Guys are asking her out just to siphon gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what today is? Today is 'Take Your Dog to Work' Day. In fact, all the security guards at Los Alamos -- they brought their seeing eye dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The government says a big increase in gonorrhea in 1998. That was an election year. A lot of congressmen were back in the district. Of course, they're gonna spread that thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what state has the highest gonorrhea rate in the US? Anybody know? Arkansas? No, no, no. He's not governor anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent interview, Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, said that she never, ever reads the newspaper. That's what she said. Yeah, and after hearing about it, George W. Bush said, 'Really? Doesn't she care what happens to Marmaduke?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gary Graham.had the shoddiest trial in history. . Bush, the little Bush kid, who's the running for president -- He's been trying to kill this guy. . This was this guy's 21st appeal. And Bush, today, said, you know, '20 appeals? My God, who, does this guy think he is, Elian Gonzalez?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Senate voted today to spend $1 billion. They've been talking about this for a while now. $1 billion going to the country of Colombia for drugs -- to fight drugs that is. That's right. The State Department says this is strategic thinking, to stop the drugs there, before they get to Whitney Houston.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Ralph Nader. . He had a press conference with Jimmy Hoffa. They are joining forces, Jimmy Hoffa and Ralph Nader. Apparently the Teamsters and the Green Party want to get together and form a party that conserves energy by never working.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's good to see Clinton using his DNA for good instead of evil, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The state of Texas has a new slogan, 'Death in about an hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess George W. Bush's handlers are telling him he has to act tough, so he's not perceived as a wimp. They're telling him to hang tough. In fact, to show how tough he is, today, in Texas, a guy was executed by lethal injection while sitting in an electric chair that was in the gas chamber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore is in trouble for using something called the iced tea defense. Have you heard about this? Well, you know all this fundraising stuff they're trying to nail him on? Now Al Gore told the FBI -- I'm not kidding, this is part of the official transcript -- that he missed important parts of a fundraising meeting. He missed that part with the funny business going on because he drank too much iced tea and had to go to the bathroom. See, that's what I love about the Clinton Administration. Whenever there's the scandal, it's always the same body part that's involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ralph Nader is now the presidential candidate of the Green Party. Finally a candidate with some excitement!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They are worried Ralph Nader will siphon votes away from Al Gore. I think Al Gore is siphoning votes away from Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;British and American scientists yesterday announced they successfully completed the mapping of the human genetic code. They have completed a DNA map of the human gene. See, here's what I don't understand about the world we live in, okay? We're able to map the genetic code -- how hard is that? We discover water on Mars. There's water on Mars. We have found it. We create life in a test tube. Yet, you ask these experts why is gas s expensive?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The folks that make M&amp;M's asked the American people to vote, and they voted to bring back red M&amp;M's. Who says American voters are apathetic, huh? You give us something worth voting for, we'll be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like Ralph Nader is serious about running for president. In fact, he said today he's considering pressing his suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Ralph Nader is described as a left wing alternative to Al Gore, with no real chance of winning. How is that an alternative to Al Gore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest census figures, one of the places with the fastest growing population -- what would you say? Nevada. Nevada. Fastest growing population. Place losing the most? Death row in Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scary news, scary news for death row inmates in Texas. It seems they executed so many people - what was it? 135? So many people, they've actually run out of the poison they use for the lethal injection. Now they're using just a really big hammer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Signs The Supreme Court Needs A Vacation: 10. Most of their rulings taken word-for-word from that day's 'Judge Judy.' 9.

Rehnquist has been 'pounding the gavel' four, maybe five times a day. 5. Most days court consists of three justices and six magic 8 balls. 4. Just held tribal council and voted out Justice Anthony Kennedy. 3. Last couple of cases each day are decided by the cleaning crew. 2. Only thing they're arguing lately is margaritas vs. daiquiris. 1. Oath witnesses must take: 'Do you swear blah blah blah?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The government is finally going to put warning labels on cigars. Of course, people who smoke have said for years they should also put it on cigars and now they're gonna do it. It's gonna say, 'Warning -- cigars are a link to cancer, heart disease and impeachment.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;A new book is coming up. It says J. Edgar Hoover, the G-man from the FBI all those years -- J. Edgar Hoover is partially black. Can you believe that? They said he's got a lot of black blood. I tell ya, I knew he was a queen. I didn't know he was RuPaul.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He would have said more, but he had to get to an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore speaking out on the environment this week. Al Gore says he wants vehicles now to run on something called biomass.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Elian Gonzalez is back in Cuba, ladies and gentlemen, after seven months. His final words before he got on the plane: 'Well, let me know who wins the million on &quot;Survivor.&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;And then he thanked the American people for turning a simple legal matter into a six-month circus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Elian couldn't wait to get home and see Cuba's favorite children's film -- the Zapruder film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;After kicking Elian out of the country the Supreme Court had time to ban homosexual troop leaders from the Boy Scouts. . Not only is this a landmark decision, it's the first time gays have been banned from any group that wears handkerchiefs around their necks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;George Bush, you know the little Bush kid? . He's on a whirlwind tour this week -- this must be difficult for him -- of minority groups. Monday he was speaking to Hispanics in Washington. Tuesday he was with Blacks in Detroit, his home turf. . Luckily, he's heading for a weekend where he can decompress playing golf at an all-white country club.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier today, President Clinton signed a new law, get this, that makes contracts signed over the Internet just as valid as contracts that are signed on paper.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura recently taped an episode of the soap opera 'The Young and the Restless.' Latest thing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That Diana Ross and the Supremes reunion tour -- not working out. Give you an idea how bad they're doing, at the last concert, they had to open for Roger Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess Clinton is now at Camp David trying to broker peace between Barak and Arafat. That should be easy, huh? They've only been fighting 8,000 years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big debate in Washington these days now seems to be over senior citizens and prescription drugs, you know this whole story? I guess House Republicans want HMOs in charge of drugs, and President Clinton says he wants the patients to be in charge of drugs. Today George W. Bush said, 'Hey, why can't senior citizens just buy their drugs on the street like I had to? Why can't they do that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is shaping up to be a pretty exciting election, isn't it? Gore or Bush -- what is that? You either get put to sleep or put to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They were talking about Gray Davis as a possible running mate for Vice President Gore -- he's our Governor here in California, Gray Davis. But he said today he's not interested in being Al Gore's Vice President. Damn.  I was on the edge of my seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What a hot ticket that would have been, huh? That's not a Presidential ticket -- that's a wax museum, isn't it? Gore-Davis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, George W. Bush -- did you know this -- he gave a big speech at the annual NAACP convention. I'm sure it was a big speech, yeah.  And folks, actually, it was a little uncomfortable at the beginning of the speech because George W. started by saying, 'Wow, there are a lot of black people here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This is interesting -- environmental protesters raided and took over Al Gore's campaign office, saying that Gore could do more to protect our natural resources. It's a big story. Yeah, and folks, things got really awkward because one of the protesters tried to chain himself to a tree and then realized it was Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a new report in today's USA Today -- this is interesting -- sexual activity among teenagers has declined over the past ten years. Gone down. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, President Clinton called American teens lazy and said that when he was a teen, he used to have sex barefoot while walking uphill in the snow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Republican Party announced their plans this week for their convention in Philadelphia. The Republican convention is in Philadelphia next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can sense the excitement in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, you know, they're pretty clever, these Republicans. I think they got a good idea to try to get ratings. What they're going to do is start the convention every night with ten death row inmates, then each night execute a different guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in Baltimore today, Vice President Al Gore spoke with members of the NAACP. You know, I think Al's trying too hard to show the NAACP that he can relate. Like today during his speech, he held up his ticket stub from 'Shaft.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He also told them he invented rap. I don't think that's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How's Clinton making out with that peace treaty between the Arabs and the Israelis? After that thing he worked out with Hillary, this should be easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't think it's going too well. In fact, I'm going to make a prediction right here. . I predict we will have peace in the Middle East the same day you see a 'Rocky and Bullwinkle Part II' premiere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The heavy metal band Metallica testified before the Senate, and they complained that every day, thousands of fans download their music on the Internet for free. They're very unhappy about it. Yeah. Yeah, and after hearing this, Senator Strom Thurmond said, 'Really? I thought I was the only one downloading Metallica every day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

And they're doing something clever. Our mayor, Mayor Riordan, very clever man, see what they're doing for crowd control? They're going to bring in Diana Ross and the Supremes to help disperse the crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore said today, 'It's time for Congress to wake up and smell the coffee.' See, that's a common theme with Al Gore speeches. 'Wake up, have some coffee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see the footage of the Philadelphia police kicking that guy, punching that guy or, as they call it in Texas, tenderizing the meat before you fry it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But again, there were white cops and black cops together. Ebony and ivory kicking together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton said today, here you go -- Al Gore has done more than any other Vice President in history. Is that really a compliment really? That's like the NBA giving the award to the most valuable Clipper, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bill Bradley has endorsed Al Gore for President. That's it. The race is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you see these two standing together, looks like Nytol and Sominex. Talk about the bland leading the bland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;For the past 23 years, one of the two finalists to be Al Gore's Vice President, Florida Senator Bob Graham -- you ever heard of this guy? According to People Magazine, he has kept 4,000 color-coded diaries, where he records minute by minute every single thing he does every day. He writes everything he does in the diary, including meals and when he goes to the bathroom. You know, I think Al Gore may have accomplished the impossible, ladies and gentlemen. He may he found the only guy in America more boring than he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee -- that sounds like the Governor of Arkansas, doesn't it? He's moved out of the governor's mansion and moving into a double-wide trailer on the grounds of the mansion. . This is not going over well with those Arkansas voters. Seeing the governor putting on airs, acting like a rich guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today, George W. Bush -- or as I call him W. -- George W. Bush said that he has narrowed his list of potential running mates down to three people. That's what he said. That's right. Yeah, Bush said that means each one has a 50% chance of being chosen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Speaking of Bush, according to today's New York Post, George W. Bush thinks that he will carry New York state during the election because of the 'anti-Hillary factor.' That's what he said. Yeah. Yeah, and in response -- in response, Al Gore said, 'That's ridiculous. I've hated Hillary much longer than he has. This is not right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the latest news is new evidence today says tobacco can cause heart attacks. Yeah. Especially if you're the CEO of a tobacco company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you hear about that verdict? A Miami jury has ordered the major tobacco companies to pay $145 billion. You know what that means, a lot of congressmen are gonna have to take a pay cut.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Everybody's waiting to see who Bush and Gore pick as their vice presidential running mates. Which, you know, traditionally, the candidate will pick someone who doesn't threaten his abilities, someone who's less appealing, less informed, less charismatic, less dynamic. You know, it's too bad these two can't pick each other. They would be perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And here is the big non-story of the day -- according to a new book called 'State of the Union,' back in 1974 -- did you hear about this? Hillary Clinton allegedly made an anti-Semitic remark. And today, John Rocker said, 'Hey, she's got my vote.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, we've done a lot of Hillary jokes. I gotta take her side. This is so stupid. The book was written by a former reporter for the National Inquirer. And he also claims that Hillary gave birth to Elvis' love child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But Hillary said today, and she defended it today -- I would have just shut up. But she did, she came out, she said she has nothing against the Jewish people. In fact, she said some of her husband's best girlfriends have been Jewish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton defended Hillary. And this is what he said: he said she may have called someone a bastard, but not a racial slur. Get the feeling Clinton is drawing on personal experience there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the President-elect of Mexico, Vincente Fox, I believe his name is. He's called for an open border between the US and Mexico, which surprised me. I thought we already had an open border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the US has signed a trade agreement with Vietnam. The pact will allow Vietnam better access to our markets, and in exchange, Vietnam has agreed to take back Jane Fonda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Fidel Castro caused quite a stir. He said Jesus Christ was a communist. . Jesus was poor, he dressed in rags, he had no job. Sounds more like a Cuban, really, than a communist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm sorry, I think Castro was way off. I don't think Jesus would have spent one day in Cuba. Hey, he could have just walked to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of movies opened over the weekend. Another one called 'But I'm a Cheerleader,' which used to be the password to get into the White House, did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been following the big summit there at Camp David? Things aren't going well. Earlier today, Arafat was voted off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Arafat was so depressed, Hillary rushed in with a consoling hug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bill Clinton is doing what he can. Earlier today he leaned over to Barak and said, 'You know, my last girlfriend was Jewish.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary Clinton held a press conference to deny allegations she made an anti-Semitic remark. . John Rocker called Clinton's comment 'the feel good comment of the summer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Hillary added that some of her best accountants are Jewish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot today, Hillary Clinton made an ethnic slur about Eskimos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess in an effort now to get on the good side of Jewish voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton now says she's dropping the word 'ham' from her name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, at a press conference, Hillary vehemently denied she's ever made any anti-Semitic comments. You know, these alleged comments by Hillary were from what, 26 years ago? To give you an idea how long ago that was, back then, Bill was still having sex with her.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, every idiot is coming out of the woods with more allegations. Now, a former Arkansas state trooper -- apparently, you know, the ones that used to get girls for Bill -- he's now claiming Hillary made anti-black remarks. Please. You know, if this keeps up, she could be the keynote speaker at the Republican convention next month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Small fire at the White House over the weekend, in the East Wing.  It's lucky nobody was injured. Officials said the fire started after Hillary canceled her plans to visit the White House and Bill began rubbing his hands together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And this whole Israeli-Palestine thing. This isn't going too well for Clinton. I don't understand this whole Camp David idea. You take two guys whose countries have hated each other for what, 8,000 years. These people hate each other. And you think, 'Well, if I can just get them on a romantic getaway weekend. No kids. Maybe they could fall in love all over again. Scented candles, massage oil. What were we fighting about?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And on Sunday, George W. Bush said on ABC's This Week, he said for his running mate, he will pick someone who will be qualified to be President of the US. See, he's lucky. He gets to pick someone who's qualified to be President. We have to pick between him and Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And next month, there will be a private, invitation-only reception at the Playboy mansion during the Democratic National Convention. The Playboy mansion hosting a little fundraiser for the Democrats. But Al Gore said he will not be attending. Well, I guess a lot of people are broken up about that. I mean, imagine going to the Playboy mansion without Al Gore. Why bother?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you think Bill's going, 'I'll do it, I'll do it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Cuban President Fidel Castro taking some heat for saying Jesus Christ was a communist. . Well, I understand where Castro's coming from. I mean, for years, the Cuban government has been trying to feed thousands of people with what, a few fish and a loaf of bread, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;There are 70 million rats in New York City. Here is the break-down: 35 million are for Hillary, 35 million are for Rick Lazio.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Republican candidate George W. Bush has unveiled his new $200 million proposal to promote responsible fatherhood. Bush says if fathers were more responsible for bringing up their children, he wouldn't have to execute so many of them later in life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore says while he is in Los Angeles, he will not attend a Democratic fundraiser at the Playboy mansion. Apparently, he's tired of being around playboys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, two Playboy playmates were vendors at a meatless hot dog stand on Capitol Hill to protest the American Meat Institute. They were selling meatless hot dogs. The girls were naked except for strategically- placed pieces of lettuce. I think we can guess where Clinton had lunch this afternoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, I think he said he just had a salad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday on the campaign trail, Al Gore was back home in Tennessee visiting a preschool. That's what he was up to. Gore was visiting a preschool. And apparently, Gore gives the same speech to every audience because he kept asking the toddlers, 'Aren't you better off now than you were four years ago? Think about it. 'You were wetting yourselves then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I feel sorry for Clinton, because his job at these peace talks, of course, is to try to relieve the tension between Arafat and Barak. And, unfortunately, Clinton's preferred method of relieving tension no longer available to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And tomorrow night, a great new thriller opens. This is a great movie, 'What lies beneath.' . It's a very scary movie. It's really good. I don't want to give anything away. It's about a cheating husband whose wife turns into a woman who he cheated with. And today, Bill Clinton called it 'the scariest movie I've ever seen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During next month's Democratic convention in Los Angeles, which is where they're having it, the Los Angeles Police Department says they're going to keep political activists in line by using rubber bullets and pepper spray. That's what they said. Yeah, and coincidentally, that's the same way they'll keep the crowd awake during Al Gore's speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said that he does not -- does not believe that Hillary Clinton screamed an anti-Semitic slur at a colleague years ago. Said he doesn't believe it. And after hearing about Giuliani's comments, Hillary said, 'I'd like to thank that Italian bastard for standing up for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The G-8.held their annual summit in Okinawa, Japan today. For those of you not familiar with the G-8, it is where we decide how to screw the Third World for the next 50 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;G-8 members could not agree on how to reduce Third World Debt, but they all agreed that Richard on 'Survivor' is a real bastard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, John McCain now hinting he would consider the vice presidency under George W. Bush. How about that ticket? Huh, McCain and Bush? Huh? The hot head and the crack head?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And here's an interesting story. It seems during the Democratic convention next month, the West Hollywood city council is going to temporarily rename Clinton Avenue -- you know Clinton Avenue over there? They're renaming it Bill Clinton Avenue. And also in honor of President Clinton, it will become the world's first three-way street.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the city has really thought this out. They planned it well, because if you look at a map, you'll see that Bill Clinton Avenue spills out onto Santa Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you something though, I think the real reason West Hollywood is changing the name to Clinton Avenue is, I think they're hoping to attract some female prostitutes for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the government now considering changing the standards for adultery in the military. They want to make the laws less rigid. And Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts wants to decriminalize sodomy and other sexual acts in the military. In fact, have you heard the Army's new slogan? 'You don't even want to know what we do before 9:00 AM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Political insiders are saying that George W. Bush -- or as I call him, Dubyah -- he has narrowed his list of potential running mates to just a few names. It's getting exciting. That's right. Yeah, reportedly, some names have been eliminated because they're either too liberal, too controversial or too hard for Bush to spell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Those Middle East peace talks are continuing. . Clinton, he stayed one extra day, but then, he had to go off to Japan for his next summit.  He's cheating on this summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;He left Madeleine Albright, our Secretary of State, in charge of the summit. . I don't think she really commands the same respect as the President does, because the first written proposal today to her was signed 'Dick Hertz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Clinton is very concerned about this, because this is a big part of his legacy, and I think it's amazing that he got these two parties to stay. What's more amazing is that Clinton seems to have better luck in hotel rooms with Palestinian terrorists than Little Rock trailer trash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Gore went to Texas. Now, he's making fun of Bush in his home state. He said the rainy day fund that they have down there in Texas under Bush only is worth 16 hours. In other words, the rainy day fund can only run the state for 16 hours, even less if you run the electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I was just thinking -- in the time it took me to walk out here, Dick Cheney had five more heart attacks. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's the big talk this past weekend about who George W. Bush is going to pick as his vice president. He'll say officially tomorrow. Apparently, Bush has narrowed it down to Dick Cheney and this coke dealer he owes $60,000 to.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And political experts say the one drawback is Cheney has had three heart attacks. Whew! It's not good when Strom Thurmond can beat you racing up a flight of stairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's not good. I guess instead of 'Airforce Two,' he'll travel around in 'Ambulance Two.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I guess they even had famed heart surgeon -- what's that guy's name -- Dr. Denton Coolly. He says that Cheney's heart is now okay, which is a shock to a lot of people. This is the first time in history anyone said a conservative Republican even had a heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, this is very smart, Cheney and Bush. This is what the Republicans are calling a 'Wizard of Oz' ticket. A Wizard of Oz ticket -- you know what that means? You see, Cheney needs a heart, Bush needs a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, listen to this, during the Democratic convention here in Los Angeles, Al Gore is reportedly planning a symbolic passing of the baton from President Clinton. You know, Gore better be careful. With Clinton, it might not be a baton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In other TV news, the 'West Wing' and the 'Sopranos' have tied for the most Emmy nominations -- 18 each. In fact, this is the most the White House and the mafia had in common since the Kennedy Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It looks like George W. Bush is going to jump start his campaign. He is really shifting into high gear. . It looks like he is going to select Dick Cheney as his running mate. So we'll get some of that 'Dick Cheney Mania.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney is a little older than Bush. He's had 3 heart attacks and a couple of by-pass surgeries. I think as a change of pace it will be nice to have someone in the Oval Office whose arteries are hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Shocking Facts About Dick Cheney: 10. To make himself more appealing to Bush, executed 47 people in Wyoming. 9. Once dressed up as a bellhop to meet 'N Sync. 8. Recently caught scribbling 'George + Cheney' during strategy meeting. 7. Accused of conflict of interest after voting in favor of tax cut for bald guys. 6. For brief 6-month period in 1974, known as Rita Cheney. 5. As Secretary of Defense, approved 'Arms For Gyros' deal with Greece. 4. He's fat. 3. Told Bush only place he plans on campaigning is 'Margaritaville'. 2. Spends 17 hours a day at 'Big Brother' website looking at exotic dancer. 1. Picks up chicks by claiming to be Alan Greenspan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;There are rumors that Hillary Clinton has been involved in lesbian affairs. And this proves what I've been saying all along -- Hillary is a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;In a recent interview Fidel Castro said that if Jesus were alive today he would be a Communist. Castro added that if Jesus were Cuban he'd walk on water to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush was upset when he heard the leaders at the G- 8 summit agreed to spend $55 million a year to wipe out illiteracy. Bush said, &quot;$55 million to wipe out illiteracy is a waste. What they should be doing is teaching these people how to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: Dick Cheney is &quot;a veteran of Washington politics and Republican politics. His first job in Washington was Ford's -- Gerald Ford's chief-of- staff. So they just think that George W. Bush and a guy who worked for Ford are going to get along well. Because during the '70s Bush and Ford both spent a lot of time tripping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;President Clinton, he has certainly been earning his pay. As you know, he was over there in Japan with the G-8 summit, flew back, raced back to talk with the leaders of the Mideast. He threw himself in there Sunday night. Got back from his trip, threw himself in, talked with the negotiators. Then today, talked all day with Barak and Arafat, oddly enough, only about Tiger Woods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Finally, we should mention that tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act which had a great impact on integrating the handicapped in this country to mainstream society. Of course, you only have to look at the presidential race and you realize how they have boosted the careers of the lame.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What was it, 105 today? Not the temperature, Dick Cheney's pulse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you probably know by now, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who's had three heart attacks and bypass surgery, has been chosen to become George W. Bush's vice presidential running mate, which is kind of ironic. He can't run, and he can't mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, we kid about these things, but he is just an irregular heartbeat away from the presidency.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, the Bush people today came up with a new campaign slogan in honor of Cheney, 'Clear!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess the hardest thing for him is getting up to that podium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, they said today instead of campaign donors, they're looking for organ donors. So please, if you're a Republican and you want to donate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, just a couple more days until Republican convention in Philadelphia. Par-tay, par-tay. There's a good combination. You got a vice presidential nominee with heart trouble in a city known for its giant cheese steak sandwiches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, that'll go good. (They ought) to have it in winter and throw in a snow shovel, too. Get him out there doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, there was a lot of concern about him having a bad heart. But when you think about it, why? Why would -- he's a Republican. You see, for a Republican, a heart is like your appendix. It's nice to have it. You don't really need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More and more facts coming out today about Cheney. Did you know he dropped out of Yale? He went to Yale University. He dropped out of school, bad grades. Yet George W. Bush is a graduate of Yale. Huh? Is that scary? That means Bush is the smart one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know how Dick Cheney got this job? He's the guy Bush hired to oversee the whole running mate selection process. George Bush asked Dick Cheney, 'Help me find a running mate.' And he came up with himself. Do you think he looked that hard? You know? This is a little like O.J.'s search for the real killers, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last week -- did anybody know this? Very quietly last week, Congress approved themselves a nice big pay raise. Anybody know that? Just kind of snuck it in there. Well, see, after that big $</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">154 billion judgment, the tobacco industry can't afford to pay them anymore. Now we apparently have to chip in the extra dough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush announced that he's chosen Dick Cheney as his running mate. It's big news. . And this is interesting -- George W. said that if elected, Cheney will be in charge of all normal vice presidential duties as well as spelling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This is the weird thing - Governor Bush hired Dick Cheney to advise him on picking a running mate, and Cheney ended up being the running mate. This is true. That's true. Yeah, yeah, and they think it happened, because reportedly, Cheney submitted a list of three possible candidates -- himself, Carrot Top and Eddie van Halen. And Eddie was busy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Now Al Gore, still in the race. Al Gore is trying to decide his running mate, and political experts are saying that Gore needs to find a running mate with more charisma than he has to energize the ticket. That's what they're saying. Yeah, so in other words, it could be anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has selected his vice presidential running mate -- Dick Cheney. . Dick Cheney is very excited. He's already resigned form his restricted country club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney -- didn't he manage the Kansas City Royals for a while?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Letterman: &quot;Bush-Cheney -- I haven't been this excited since Dukakis- Bentsen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Letterman: &quot;It seems to me that George W. Bush didn't take his search for a number two as Regis is taking his search for a number two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton conceded failure after the break down of the Middle East summit. There is one upside: This is Kathie Lee Gifford's last week on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Ehud Barak complained that Yasser Arafat wouldn't compromise on the issue of Jerusalem while Arafat complained that at night Barak didn't like to cuddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The breakdown of the talks means Clinton will not realize his legacy as a lying philanderer who brought peace to the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Maher: &quot;Yesterday, it was just speculation. Whew! Thank God today it's official. Dick Cheney is going to be Bush's vice presidential candidate. Boy, if he was any duller, he'd be on 'Big Brother.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Maher: &quot;But apparently he's a can-do kind of guy and that's what Bush wanted. He wanted a guy who was loyal, smart and in a pinch could score a gram.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush conceded that Dick Cheney is perhaps not the most exciting guy in the world, but he has been around Washington forever and he can explain to George W. Bush the tricky stuff, like how a bill becomes a law. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Maher: &quot;I don't know what's going on there in that Middle East summit, but President Clinton still tirelessly, and I mean than literally, tirelessly working, taking care of business and working overtime there with Arafat. But, you know, that's what happens when you put off creating your legacy until the last minute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Maher: &quot;The Republican convention is coming next week to Philadelphia. And the city of Philadelphia knocked down 950 dilapidated houses the other day. That's right. They want to spruce up for the Republican convention. They say they were inspired by the theme of the convention - 'Out of sight, out of mind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's so hot today.boy, people were sweating like Dick Cheney trying to get life insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, this just in from Republican National Headquarters -- Dick Cheney's heart still beating, ladies and gentlemen. Day two, day two, day two. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, I saw a bunch of you walking around with a sign that said 'Cheney 2000.' It turns out that was his cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, they unveiled the new campaign slogan. They said 'Cheney -- the only candidate that comes with an expiration date.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Who's Bush going to pick in 2001? That's the question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all see the big Republican press conference yesterday? You see, they showed Bush introducing Dick Cheney. Did you see them standing together? Makes Bush look like he's in trouble with the principal. Doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, you know, before naming Cheney as his running mate, Bush did an exhaustive background check. You know, to make sure Cheney wasn't a narc, you know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But it's an interesting choice because Cheney has had a lot more experience than Bush, with the Gulf War and all the foreign things. Cheney's a lot smarter than Bush. Plus, Cheney is older and more mature-looking. See, everyone said Bush chose Cheney to avoid that whole Dan Quayle thing. But the ironic thing is, now he's the Dan Quayle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Cheney also told reporters today he isn't concerned about his prior health problems. He says if his heart ever does stop beating, George W. Bush has a little something to get it going again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, the Democrats now, they're just -- feeding frenzy now. The Democrats, I'm watching Jesse (Jackson), I'm watching all the guys on the attack today. They're having a field day with the fact that Cheney has had three heart attacks, plus bypass surgery. Let me tell you something, even if Cheney dies in office, he can still do the job of Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, boy, and Gore. Even Gore spoke out today. Al Gore says that he has a secret weapon in the debates against Dick Cheney. He said he's just gonna go 'Boo,' and apparently -- I don't know. I don't know whether that will work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I'll tell you something. These problems with Dick Cheney's heart, it makes you appreciate President Clinton all the more. I mean, Clinton's only problem is he had an organ that worked too well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're making a movie about the Elian Gonzalez thing. Can you belief that? Who's gonna watch that? And you know, they got big stars. They got big names to do this thing. Playing the part of Janet Reno: Jack Palance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And according to the New York Post, the plastic surgery that Linda Tripp -- you remember Linda? You remember Linda Tripp, there? The plastic surgery she had on her face didn't take. I'm not being mean. Well, it didn't work too well. This is what it said in the paper. They said she had this surgery done, and her chin is moving around. Well, of course it's moving around. She's used to having four other chins leaning on it to hold it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Some political analysts are saying that by picking Dick Cheney as his running mate and hoping to put Colin Powell in his cabinet, George W. Bush just wants to re-create his father's Administration. Copy it. That's what they're saying. And in response, George W. said, 'That is ridiculous.' Then he flew to Japan and threw up on the prime minister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Archaeologists have discovered a 2,000-year-old toilet. It's a true story. Yeah, and apparently -- apparently, right after they discovered it, Bob Dole said, 'Hang on, I'll be out in a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Agreements Reached at Camp David 10. One thing worse than sitting through 15 days of negotiations is 15 minutes of 'Big Brother' 9. Palestine gets Gaza Strip, Israel gets Gaza strippers 8. When you're drunk, it's much harder to say 'Ehud Barak' than 'Yasser Arafat' 7. If George W. Bush becomes president, we're all screwed 6. At future summit meetings, Madeleine Albright stops wearing see- through blouses 5. They all 'totally have to keep in touch next year' 4. No blondes 3. Nothing better than wrapping up long day of negotiations with a round of 'Pictionary' 2. The Israeli and Palestinian governments really, really, really have to set up intern programs 1. Those girls on 'Sex and the City' are right -- men are d-o- g-s dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Since George Bush has already chosen his running mate, the attention turns to al Gore, who met with the head of his search committee, Warren Christopher. Although he is a brilliant tactician, Christopher is best remembered a the sad little elf who couldn't say Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Gore is under fire for accepting campaign contributions from Hugh Hefner after publicly criticizing Playboy. . The controversy began when Gore blamed Playboy for making him stiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Bush and Cheney, they've made their first campaign stop today. They went to Wyoming, his home state. They were well received by Republicans there. They praised the choice of Dick Cheney. They say he adds something to the ticket that Bush desperately needs, adult supervision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Last year, (Cheney) made $26 million, good salary, as CEO of Halliburton, apparently a big oil concern there. $26 million. But he says he has the exact same values he had when he made $15 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Overseas, Fidel Castro, proving Arafat is not the only foreign leader who can get national attention, staged a million-Cuban march. Although I don't think it was quite a million in Havana to protest our economic embargo against the Cubans. Back here in the states, Cuban Americans protested. They denounced Castro. They said he heads a fascist regime that monitors and scrutinizes its citizens' everyday existence. And then, they went off and watched 'Big Brother.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;So hot today, Al Gore claimed he invented the Slurpee. That's how hot it was today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scary incident out on the campaign trail. I guess the Secret Service reported that a right-wing gun nut turned up at a George W. Bush campaign rally, but luckily, it was just Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, Dick Cheney returned home to Wyoming where he visited his old high school. Cheney reminisced about his freshman year when he had his very first heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He is just a heartbeat away from having a heartbeat, that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, with Dick Cheney as the vice president, this kind of complicates things for George W. Bush, because now Bush has another new thing to learn -- CPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, Cheney has had, what -- I guess he's okay now, but he's had three heart attacks in the past and a bunch of bypass surgeries. Doctors said today -- I guess his doctors admit he has high cholesterol levels. That's a good ticket. One guy has a cholesterol level of 250, the other guy's got an SAT score of 250.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And this Cheney guy, very conservative. He's what they call a conservative's conservative. Like today on the Today Show, he said he's in favor of abortion, but only in cases where the baby will grow up to be a liberal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, the Republican National Convention begins next week in Philadelphia. Get your VCRs ready!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's an interesting question. You know what the Liberty Bell and George W. Bush have in common? Anybody know? Both of them had a crack problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Robert Downey Jr. was interviewed from prison on the Today show this morning. This is an unbelievable story. He said he started doing drugs when he was 7. Isn't that amazing, 7 years old? Today, George Bush said, 'So? Late bloomer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, according to the New York Post today, the plastic surgery that Linda Tripp had on her face didn't take. . That's a bad sign, when plastic surgery rejects your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said her chin keeps moving around, I guess from the constant chewing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush's vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, has a lesbian daughter. And George W. says he knew about this and he's willing to support her. Isn't that nice? That's right, willing to support her.  And in a related story, President Clinton announced he's willing to videotape her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Political experts say that if George W. Bush wants to be elected president, it's crucial that he give an impressive speech at next week's Republican convention -- crucial. Which is very strange, because they say if Gore wants to be elected president, he should never speak again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush and Dick W. Cheney are out now campaigning.  I haven't been this excited since Dole-Kemp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney had a big day. He had two town hall meetings, three press conferences and a mild heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney brings experience, steadiness and foreign policy skills to the ticket. And I'm thinking, 'What the hell is Bush bringing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The broadcast networks announced today they are going to air less of the conventions, the political conventions -- the Republicans start next week, of course -- than they ever have before. They interviewed one guy. He said he had no interest in seeing a phony, predetermined drama. And also, it conflicted with wrestling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Another hot day around the country, man. People were sweating like Al Gore looking at the latest poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton was on the news today. He said this summer he's going on a whistle stop tour. He's not campaigning, he's going to whistle and see if girls stop.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former playmate Anna Nicole Smith, remember her? Well, she is back in court this week trying to claim the estate of her late husband. The 90- year-old guy. . You know the whole story, she married this guy when she was 26 and he was 87. What kind of marriage is that, young-looking air-head with an aging oil man with a bum ticker? Sounds more like the current Presidential ticket, what is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush is selling himself as a candidate with new and original ideas. Really? See USA Today. This is today's paper, okay? This is today's paper. Let me show you something. New and original idea, okay? Get a shot. There's George W. Bush with his dog. You know what that dog's name is? Spot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Starting Monday is the opening of the Republican convention in Philadelphia, to prepare, the GOP -- what they are doing over there -- officials began clearing the streets of the homeless, indigent and anyone else making less than $100,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess the Republican platform is starting to take shape. So far it has divided into two sections, smoke and mirrors, and these will alternate all week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They showed today on the news getting the convention hall ready. 150,000 balloons, which is frightening. One of those could pop and give Cheney another heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;An Israeli newspaper is reporting that Prime Minister Barak almost choked to death on a bone during the Camp David peace talks. You know, if you're an Israeli, that has to be your worst nightmare, you're choking to death, and the only other man in the room is Arafat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Napster was shut down. Napster, isn't that Al Gore's nickname?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And according to the New York Post today, the plastic surgery that Linda Tripp had on her face, it didn't take. How can it not take? Spent $30,000 on it -- $30,000. That is one expensive veterinarian, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Chelsea Clinton made an announcement today that was pretty important. Chelsea Clinton announced that she is postponing her senior year at Stanford University until January, so that she can stay with her father during his last few months in the White House. Isn't that nice? Sweet. Very sweet, yeah, and in return, the President offered to stay with Chelsea during her last few months in her sorority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that World Wrestling star, the Rock, is going to be the one introducing vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney at next week's Republican convention. That's true. The rock will introduce Cheney. Yeah, and just to show Cheney's heart is okay, the rock is going to body slam Cheney into the audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot today, I actually saw people moving slower than Janet Reno investigating Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I read in the paper today, Al Gore is on vacation all this week. From what? From what? How can you even tell? How does he even go on vacation? What do they, disassemble him? Put him in a box somewhere?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, today, the start of the Republican Convention in Philadelphia! Yeah! Yeah! Party, Party! Otherwise known as 'The Million White Man March,' yeah!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you know the difference between Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton? Cheney grabs his own chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Governor Bush won't even arrive at the convention until Thursday. Bush said he has to go back to the office. Apparently, death row inmates are starting to pile up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush has gotten another jump in the polls. Got a pretty good lead now. They said on the Sunday morning political talk shows that Bush is enjoying what they call a 'convention-week buzz.' Today Bush said, 'Yeah, but it's still not as good as my old 'six pack of Heineken a day buzz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush now, also, being criticized for using nonunion actors in a campaign commercial, during the actors' strike. The actors strike is going on.  . I can't believe he was able to get nonprofessional actors to look interested in what he wanted to say. Boy, must have been pretty good actors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the main goal of the Republican convention, they say now, is to demonstrate the new inclusive Republican party that has a broader appeal. Instead of just appealing to white Anglo-Saxon protestants, the new Republican party will reach out to Lutherans, or maybe Methodists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And thousands of homeless people marched outside the Republican convention today. See, I don't think the Republicans inside really understood what was going on. One delegate asked the protesters, 'Hey, if you're homeless, why don't you just stay in the servants quarters, hmm?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Did you watch the convention? The Republican Convention started tonight? No, of course, you didn't. No one did. I had to, it's my job and I resented it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;If you didn't see it, it looked like the WB. I've never seen so many -- it was an endless parade of black people. I'm telling you. I'm not kidding. It was like Showtime at the Apollo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;There was blacks, Hispanics, more blacks, Native Americans, more blacks. You wouldn't have known it was a Republican convention except for all the rich white guys in the audience checking for their wallets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I'm telling you, they had Asian unwed mothers, they had a black choir, an R&amp;B group with dancers. Finally, thank God, Laura Bush came out to remind everyone that yes, it is still the party of boring white people. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;And then Colin Powell came out. And they voted him out of the house. So I don't know what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Well, the theme of tonight was 'Leave no child behind.' And apparently, the Republicans were touting it that they were very successful in attacking attention deficit disorder. Because it turns out that kicking kids off of welfare, that does get their attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Yes, the leave no child behind theme is very close to the heart of George W. Bush because you know when he was a child he was left behind twice. Once in third grade and once in the eighth grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you excited about the Republican convention? . Opening night festivities at the Republican convention down in Philadelphia. Colin Powell speaks and then right after that, Dick Cheney has a heart attack.  That's the schedule for tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You have to feel bad for Dick Cheney because he could be our next vice president and yet at the convention he has to walk around with a name tag that reads 'My Name is Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;After the Republican convention they're saying George W. Bush.will get a convention bounce. The same thing happens for the Democratic convention. A convention bounce there means that Clinton has nailed a delegate's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Republican convention got underway today in Philadelphia. I am not going. I refuse to go. If I wanted to be in a room full of dull pasty white guys, I'd just go to the Kilborn family reunion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;When asked how they felt about the convention, Republicans across the country said, 'Why the hell is Dennis Miller hosting Monday Night Football?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Some factions of the Reform Party are considering dumping Pat Buchanan from their presidential ballot. They are opting for a candidate they feel is more in keeping with their party and will have a better chance of winning: 'Skippy, the Imaginary Fire-Breathing Dragon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is two weeks of record heat. This is unbelievable. I tell ya, I was sweating like Dick Cheney at a Nelson Mandela prayer breakfast. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot in Philadelphia, Cheney traded in his pacemaker for an icemaker.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all watch the Soul Train awards last night -- I mean the GOP convention?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Republican Def Jam. The Republicans are really trying to push this diversity issue. Like, if you watched the convention last night, they had a black politician speaking at the beginning. Then they had a Hispanic woman come out, and she read the pledge of allegiance. Then, a delegate from Samoa -- he spoke. Then they had the blue mutant from 'The X- Men' -- he came in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're trying to show they're for minorities. And every time they panned the audience, you always saw an African-American man, an African- American woman. You know how they did that? All those people are played by Eddie Murphy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, though, tonight was a little sad. I think they ran out of minorities. Tonight, they just had three tan people, really tan people in the front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said the theme of this Republican convention is 'diversity and respect.' Like, the idea is to bring together the haves and the ones who have even more. This is billionaires reaching out to mere millionaires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The GOP will not rest until every child in America has a no-load mutual fund and a Roth IRA. Yeah! Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Watching this Republican convention is a lot like watching the opening ceremonies at the Olympics. You got, like, 10,000 people devoting their lives to getting as much gold as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And last night, the Republicans also spoke of the problems with the homeless. Actually, the summer homeless -- those who don't have a beach house to go to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, the Republicans don't even call them homeless, they call them 'outdoorsmen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;During his speech last night, General Colin Powell called for action to reduce the number of people in prison in this country. And George Bush said, 'Hey, I'm executing them as fast as I can. What do you want me to do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Governor's wife, Laura Bush, a lovely woman, she spoke last night. She talked about being a former librarian. Did you know that? She is a former librarian. She talked about her husband George. She didn't say how she met George, but I think we can rule out the library.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Then there was the 21-gun salute. Did you see that? It wasn't actually a 21-gun salute, it was just Charlton Heston getting drunk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you know Heston was in rehab? . Yeah, he was in rehab. In fact, tonight, he said, 'Hey, maybe guns really do kill people.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: The Republican symbol is.the elephant. Anyone know why the Republicans chose the elephant? Anybody know? An elephant is slow to move, they have trouble mating, and it takes years to clean up the mess they make afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other night, on ABC, Dick Cheney's wife was interviewed by Cokie Roberts, which is, again, ironic because 'Cokie' was George's nickname in college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you been watching the Republican National Convention? Last night I got so bored, I switched over to 'Big Brother' and watched the exotic dancer spin dry her underpants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;At the Republican National Convention last night, they had a native American speak, they had a Latin American speak, they had an African American speak, and a Jewish guy spoke. And I'm thinking, 'That's great, but, it's a foursome you'll never see at a Republican country club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Colin Powell was the big speaker and he also received the coveted Irving Thalberg Award.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The entertainment for the night was Frankie Avalon. And, if you know who Frankie Avalon is, you are automatically a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Charlton Heston is going to speak at the Republican Convention. Last week Charlton Heston admitted that he had a drinking problem, and I said to myself, 'Thank God this guy doesn't own any guns.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Say what you want about the Republican Convention. Everybody in New York City has really got that patriotic fervor that you get around convention time. . Even the hookers down in Times Square -- God bless them -- they are offering a 'Republican Convention Special.' For an extra $17.76, they'll give you something called a 'Dick Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Republican Convention got underway in Philadelphia. The key note speeches were delivered by Colin Powell and Texas First Lady Laura Bush. Laura Bush's speech was a big hit. She promised that if her husband George was elected, he will improve the nation's schools so much that no one like him would ever be taken seriously as a candidate again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;With big money on the line, the city of Philadelphia bent over backwards to appease Republican guests. They even changed their nickname to 'The City of Brotherly Love -- but not in that way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Should George Bush get elected, Colin Powell is considered the top candidate for the cabinet post Secretary of the One Person of Color in the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. is reaching out to several African Americans. In fact he says if elected, his Secretary of State will be Grandma Klump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Actor and NRA President Charlton Heston checked himself into an alcohol rehab center earlier this spring. The actor first realized he had a problem when the NRA begged him not to carry a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Each night of the convention, they have a theme, because that kicks the ratings right from obscurity to oblivion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Tonight was strength and security, with a purpose, safe in our homes and in our world. That was the theme, security and safety, which they thought was a good balance to last night's theme. Last night's theme, 'Negros, not all of them are scary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Most of the night, they saluted the old war horses of the Republican Party. They had taped packages on Ford, remember Ford, Bush, President Bush. Reagan, Dole. You heard of ' Must See TV?' This was 'Musty TV. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Some Republicans don't get named at all, now, at the convention. Nixon, never heard of him. Quayle? Quayle who? Newt Gingrich, interesting. And one they didn't mention, Goldwater. The reason there was they thought George W. Bush would hear Goldwater and might panic and think he might have to give a urine test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The whole military thing backfired. Dole saluted the veterans. McCain gave a speech on military strength. Then Georgie Bush was talking about his favorite scene from 'Stripes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess a lot of people are looking forward to the premiere of 'Hollow Man.' 'Hollow man.' Not the movie -- George Bush's acceptance speech tomorrow night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, have you been watching the big Republican NAACP convention?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Have you noticed, the Republicans are going out of their way to give minorities a featured role at this convention? Although, last night I thought they went a little too far -- like when they had rapper Old Dirty Bastard sing the national anthem.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And they had this -- this R&amp;B break-dancer. Did you see that guy? Break-dancing? That's hip now. . Did you see the guy flopping around on the floor? I thought, 'Oh my God, Dick Cheney is having another heart attack. '&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, John McCain repeatedly called George W. Bush 'his friend.' And why not? If you believe the GOP is a party of blacks, Latinos and gays, you'll believe anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you get the feeling -- every time McCain called Bush 'friend, ' he felt the same way as Hillary every time she calls Bill, 'My husband.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, former President Bush is furious at Bill Clinton for attacking his son. I guess President Clinton said nasty things about George W.  Bush. One thing about that, I mean, George W. Bush -- all right, he did duck Vietnam. And he did experiment with drugs. And he can't remember anything he did in the '70s. Why is Clinton attacking George W. Bush? He is George W. Bush. They're the same guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former President Ford suffered two minor strokes. Luckily, he's fine. We just called him. They said he's gonna make a full recovery. So God bless him. He's in pretty in good shape. And they say he'll be out of there soon. Actually, there was one embarrassing incident, though. When the ambulance arrived, out of force of habit, you know, Dick Cheney jumped in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Former San Francisco 49er Steve Young spoke at the Republican convention. And he said he likes George W. Bush because he reminds him a lot of himself. Not so much the politics, but because he also took too many hits to the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And one of the positions approved on the Republican platform this year was support for home schooling. See, I never quite understood the whole home schooling thing. How does that work? Like, do you still get a yearbook?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh -- big story today, President Clinton has delayed the first scheduled Federal execution in 37 years. He delayed it so the condemned man can seek presidential clemency. He better do it before Bush becomes President. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And over the weekend, President Clinton was in Chicago, where he spoke to the Trial Lawyers of America. Clinton speaking to the trial lawyers - - boy, that's got to be historic, huh? Probably, for the first time in history, Clinton was the most honest guy in the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in a candid interview yesterday, President Clinton says he is more worried about his wife's Senate campaign than he's ever been about his own election. Well sure, because he knows if she loses -- they are going to be home together. And you thought Frank Gifford was suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And meanwhile, our buddy Al Gore took this week off. I'm trying to imagine Al Gore on a holiday. How boring would those vacation slides be? 'Here I am next to a tree. I'm the one on the left.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You folks been watching the Republican National Convention? It has not been doing very well in the TV ratings. Last night, the Republican National Convention was beaten by Lifetime. They were showing an 'Intimate Portrait' of Aunt Bea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Republican Convention so far has been dull. Very, very dull. It's so dull, in fact, tonight Al Gore is speaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Every night the Republicans have a theme. Last night the theme was, 'Faith In Our Homes and In the World.' Tonight, the theme is 'Prosperity with a Purpose.' Tomorrow night's theme is 'Summer Salads With Tofu.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney spoke at the convention earlier tonight. His speech was interrupted 32 times by applause, and two times by minor heart attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It was a busy day for Dick Cheney. He had to pick out which one of his 50 gray suits he was going to wear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last night they had the gay addressing the Republican convention -- the openly gay Republican. Did you see this guy? See, the openly gay Republican, he hates Hillary Clinton, but he loves what she's done with her hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Announcements That Would Cause A Panic At The Republican National Convention: 10. Stop by the concession area and pick up Barbara Bush's swimsuit calendar. 9. At the conclusion of his speech, George W. Bush will execute some lucky delegate. 8. Run for your lives! Dick Cheney's heart is going to explode! 7. Because of the convention, 'Becker' will not be seen tonight. 6. Please welcome a completely naked Jesse Helms. 5.  Now, to sing our National Anthem, Dave Letterman. 4. Former President Bush, your son's head is stuck in the podium again. 3. Richard Nixon is out in the parking lot and he's pissed. 2. If anyone finds an appointment book filled with names of prominent Republicans, please return it to the hooker in the lobby. 1. The caterer forgot the scotch!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Third day of the Republican convention and before we get into the politics, we should say our thoughts are with former President Ford. That's not political. Right at the convention, he had a stroke. But he's okay.  That's good. But what a thing. It confused a lot of the delegates. They first saw him stumble. They couldn't tell if it was something serious or he was doing it for old time's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;No, he's okay. He's in the hospital. He's has a little trouble with his balance. A little trouble slurring his words. But his condition has been upgraded from Reagan to Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Dick Cheney, who they thought was very placid, made an attack dog speech. The first time in this whole convention. He was practically foaming at the mouth. Although, that could be just another heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Well, this was the night that the nominee himself, George W. Bush, the little Bush kid who's running for president -- he arrived in Philadelphia. The first place he went, I'm not kidding, was the Art Museum. Remember the big steps in 'Rocky?' That's where he went. That was the symbol. Dumb idea. You don't want to remind people of something that spawned a lousy sequel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Barbara Bush said we're going to restore honor and dignity -- wink wink, you know what that means -- to the White House. And she rued the day that the Bushes left. And she said, it would be better if we could go back to a presidency where all the lying was about taxing and all the stains were about vomit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Wow! What a crowd! Thank you very much. You're just excited because the convention's over, that's all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's some good gossip from the Republican convention. I read this today. The word is that Laura Bush, you know, the wife of Governor George Bush, has stopped wearing dark gray suits and now can be seen wearing brighter colors for TV appearances. Too bad she can't be seen with a brighter husband.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Governor Bush made his acceptance speech in Philadelphia tonight.  Before he took the stage, they ran a film. They showed a film about Bush's life. And they showed him as a young boy up to about age 15 or 16. Then the film blacked out 'til he was about 35.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the other night, Senator John McCain praised Governor Bush on TV, calling him his friend, calling him courageous, calling him a leader. Wasn't it just a couple of months ago he was attacking Bush as being unfit for office? Even his former captives in Vietnam are going, 'How did Bush get him to do that? We tortured the guy for five years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What did Bush and Cheney both say? 'We must restore dignity to the White House.' Then they cut to the guy in the audience wearing the stupid elephant hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I always like when they do the roll call, you know, they read the roll? Where chairmen from each state stands up and announces his state and tries to say something nice. Well, here, I guess, Florida was up last night. Show Florida last night.&quot; (A clip of the &quot;Florida Chairman&quot; was shown): &quot;Florida -- the great state of Florida, land of the 35-mile-an-hour speed limit. Birthplace of the Karo's Early Bird Special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's the thing. It's so different watching the Republicans now with this diversity theme. And they're reaching out to the minorities. Remember the days when the only black guy you saw at the Republican National Convention was George Hamilton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And man, this thing is getting low ratings. Nobody is watching. The networks are dying with this thing. More people saw 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' than 'Bush and Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Two reporters for the Philadelphia Inquirer -- that's the big newspaper there in Philadelphia -- they found a campaign contribution of $5,000 lying on the floor, just laying on the floor. I mean, I knew these Republicans are rich. I didn't know they were that rich. I mean, they just make an announcement - 'Okay, if it's less than 10 grand, just drop it on the floor. The janitors will get it as they sweep up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And of course, our prayers are with President Ford who had a minor stroke. He's doing much better, though. He's doing much better. Doctors said today he's going to make a full recovery. . Although, you know what I think happened? I think the convention was so dull, he was just faking it so he could get out of there, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What else today? Here's another odd story from the convention -- police in Philadelphia this week pulled over a bus filled with thousands of lizards and other small animals. Police said they were probably gonna be part of a protest at the Republican convention. Lizards as part of a protest. How tiny are their signs? You couldn't even read them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, President Clinton delayed what would have been the first Federal execution since 1963. States execute people. This is the first Federal one. See, you never see George W. Bush delaying an execution. No, no. In Texas, delay means they stop for a minute to clean the end of the needle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Charlton Heston, who's just come out of alcohol rehab, started a new organization called the NRA-AA. It's for guys who like to drink and shoot their mouths off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you enjoyed the Republican National Convention last night on CBS? . Nobody is watching this thing. The ratings just stink. Last night it was beaten by TV Land's Gomer Pyle marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Dick Cheney was speaking last night and at the end of his speech, a single white rose was tossed on stage by the Republicans' openly gay delegate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Republicans have the openly gay delegate, but the Democrats have an openly straight president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Every night at the Republican Convention, they had a theme. And tonight the theme was 'Let's End this Charade And Get Back to Our Restricted Country Club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;WWF wrestling star The Rock was at the convention last night. Incidentally, while that was going on, President Clinton was wrestling an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Last night I am watching TV. I am watching Dick Cheney on one channel and Gervase getting kicked off 'Survivor' on the other. If you flip back and forth really fast as I like to do, for just a second there is a black guy at the Republican Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Republican Convention in Philadelphia shifted into high gear last night, featuring speeches by vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney and champion pro wrestler The Rock.. Campaign workers are scrambling to create a catchy slogan for Cheney after their first choice proved a disaster: 'Dick Cheney Before He Dicks You.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Thousands of India's citizens took to the streets yesterday to protest the policies of their age-old enemy Pakistan. Weighing in on the protests, Gov. George Bush said the Indians have a right to be angry because we took their land away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I know why you're happy tonight. We finally had the big moment tonight that America was waiting for at the Republican National Convention. The end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I was getting sick of that. Now they're the touchy feely party.  Their theme was inclusiveness. Tonight's benediction was from the naked gay guy from 'Survivor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This was little George Bush -- he's running for president -- this was the little Bush kid's.big moment. He made his speech. I thought, as speeches go, it was a very well written speech. He tried to invoke Reagan, for example, bringing the inclusive theme to the bosom. 'The wall between the haves and have nots. We must tear down this wall.' Later on he had to admit, he tried to tear down the wall between his nostrils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;He also went on the attack, though. Also hit Al Gore pretty hard. He said -- trying to link Clinton and Gore - 'This is not a time for third chances. It's a time for new beginnings.' Which is also a line, by the way, he uses on inmates right before he throws the switch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Right before he spoke, they showed one of those films they always do at the conventions. Films to make you love the guy. It was called 'The Sky is the Limit.' It was footage of the Bushes walking on the beach, relaxing at home. It confused the delegates. They thought it was a commercial for Claritin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, I guess you were all up late watching the Republican convention last night, huh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I got to admit, I thought Governor Bush gave a good speech. He talked about his rough childhood, growing up in a log mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said he was driven from the age of five in a limo. But, you know, the story of his long, hard climb from wealth to great wealth, is a tough, tough American story.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What else did President Bush -- President Bush, oh I'm slipping - - Governor Bush -- he did say some interesting things. Governor Bush said last night, 'It's time for America to have a President with vision.' I think Paula Jones proved that, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I like the part where he said, 'If you give me your trust, I will honor it. If you give me an opportunity, I will seize it. And if you give me a gram, I will snort it, ladies and gentlemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He also mentioned -- he also mentioned George Washington and Thomas Jefferson -- so it's nice to see he finally started to learn the names of some of these world leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said on the news tonight, that speech was a moment of truth for George Bush's campaign. Let me tell you something -- in a political campaign, any time you can get even a moment of truth, you're way ahead of the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And then they showed a short film of George Bush's life. Of course Bush was thrilled to see it, because he couldn't remember half of it. He said, 'Oh, was that me?' Did you see how it started?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The general consensus is it was a pretty successful evening. Everyone liked Bush's manner. They said he came off like a straight-talking country boy with a charming Southern style of speaking. . In fact, one reporter -- one reporter said it reminded him of Carter and Clinton. Unfortunately it was Billy Carter and Roger Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But, you know -- now the convention is over. The plan is returning all the stuff they rented. You know, the stages, the decorations, the black, the Latino, the gay people in the audience. All going back to central casting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I thought some of those black actors were terrific. . Didn't they look like they believed that crap? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I didn't realize how diverse the Republicans are trying to get until I saw this new product in the makeup room. Look at this -- have you seen this? Get a shot of this. This is Afro Sheen 'as seen at the GOP convention.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, one area the Republicans seem to have trouble with their conventions is getting celebrities. See, the Democrats, they get the big celebrities. Magic was here last night. He said he's going to the Democratic (Convention) . Last night, who did the Republicans have? They had the Rock, the wrestler. They had game show host Ben Stein and Bo Derek. Is that the best you could do? Sounds like a bad episode of Donnie and Marie, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Bo Derek? She's sitting right in front. Right in front of President Bush. Wasn't it nice to finally see a president photographed with an attractive woman for a change? Did you see President Bush rubbing it in, 'Hey, Clinton, check it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Bush is very mad at President Clinton for criticizing his son. In fact, the paper said today this may have started a family feud. The Clintons versus the Bushes. Which -- I don't think America has seen a feud like this since the Beverley Hillbillies moved next door to the Drysdales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, here in LA, we're getting ready for the Democratic convention, which is, I guess, in what, about ten days. Week after next. And the city is going all out for this thing. Have you noticed? To make themselves more attractive to President Clinton, all the hookers are putting on like 25 to 30 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other big story here in California is all the blackouts over the past 48 hours, but enough about Charlton Heston's drinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Authorities pulled a nearly frozen man out of the wheel well of an Air France jumbo jet. You hear about this guy? Hid in the jumbo jet. The guy was sitting on the plane's landing gear, eight hours. Endured temperatures of 50 below. For eight hours. . They said his metabolism has actually dropped to Al Gore level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top Ten Signs You've Nominated A Dumb Guy 10. Gets sidetracked during speeches because microphones look like delicious ice cream cones 9. Deep wrinkles in brow from countless times he's said, 'Huh?' 8. Frequently misspells 'GOP.' 7. Ends speech by dramatically setting fire to the Constitution. 6. Brags that he combines morality of Clinton with charisma of Gore. 5. Voted to kick exotic dancer out of the 'Big Brother' house. 4. Claims to be inspired by great presidents such as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Richard Dawson. 3. Only does interviews for wrestling magazines. 2. Vows that come November, 'The hookers are gonna be calling me Mr. President'. 1. Promises to put a man on the moon by 2005.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the big story, I don't know if you're following this. You know, Al Gore selected Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman to be his running mate today. Yeah, not a lot of excitement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, it's historic. It's the first time a Jewish person has been chosen by a major party to run on a national ticket. You know the difference between Lieberman and Gore, anybody know? See, when Lieberman meets with the Chinese, it's for takeout.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I just like that name, Gore and Lieberman. Sounds like one of those discount personal injury law firms, doesn't it? 'Have you been injured? Come on down to Gore and Lieberman. We can help you out. We will get you all the money!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They're all trying to be inclusive. The Republicans are trying to get all the blacks and the minorities and everybody in. And now, Al Gore reaching out to all religions, you know, because Al Gore's a Baptist. Now his running mate is Jewish. He gets his money from Buddhist nuns. And he's about as popular now as a Moonie at the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Governor Bush has been attacking President Clinton. He said the past eight years under Clinton have been eight years of missed opportunities. And today Clinton shot back, 'Missed opportunities? Hey, pal, there are interns you don't even know about, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the other big story over the weekend, President Clinton vetoed Congress' repeal of the marriage tax penalty. I guess he figured since he had to pay a penalty for being married, everybody else should, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Happy birthday to the Queen mum, turned 100 years old over the weekend. Even though she's 100, she still has a longer life expectancy than Dick Cheney. That's amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier today, Al Gore selected Senator Joe Lieberman to be his vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket. Just when you thought the Gore campaign couldn't get more exciting!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I haven't been this excited about a ticket since Mondale- Ferraro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Gore-Lieberman -- that's a clinic over on First Avenue, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Joe Lieberman -- isn't he the agent they always thank on the Academy Awards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Joe Lieberman..is staid. He is conservative. He makes Dick Cheney look like Ricky Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;He's already bringing changes in the campaign. Today for the first time in history, Air Force Two served their first kosher meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You know the interesting thing about Joe Lieberman -- there are no interesting things about Joe Lieberman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Lieberman would be the first Jewish person to serve directly under a president since Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Al Gore has picked Joseph Lieberman, Senator Lieberman, to be his running mate. I think Gore panicked. He saw the Republicans kissing ass with the blacks and the Hispanics and he said, 'Quick, get the Jew.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;We all know why he picked Lieberman. Because Lieberman distances Gore from Clinton, because Lieberman was Clinton's biggest Democratic criticizer during impeachment. Although Lieberman does have mixed feelings. He did criticize Clinton's behavior with Monica, but he commended him.he commended him for getting half off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Now, it's going to be a difficult campaign because being an Orthodox Jew, Senator Lieberman does not campaign on Saturdays at all. He said he would make up for it on the other days by not only kissing babies, he would be happy to circumcise them as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;There is no arguing the fact that, as of today, Gore trails Bush by 17 points. And in a related news item at the box office this weekend, 'The Nutty Professor' is running far ahead of 'The Hollowman.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You sound like you're all ready for the big Democratic convention next week, huh? I tell you something, this Democratic convention, this is going to be like the Olympics for the hookers here in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now that Al Gore has picked Senator Joseph Lieberman to be his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman will be the first Orthodox Jew ever to be on the presidential ticket. In fact, today, Hillary Clinton said, 'This is a tremendous honor for our people.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, a lot of critics are saying that because Lieberman is Orthodox, it might be a problem because he can't work on the Sabbath, which, of course, in the Jewish religion is Saturday. But is that a problem, not being able to work on Saturday? He's running for vice president, okay? If he's elected, he won't have to work for four years, forget Saturday!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Even though he's Al Gore's running mate, Lieberman is still gonna run for re-election in the Senate this year. Now, that's s a big vote of confidence for Al, isn't it? 'Hey, thanks, Al, but I'm gonna hang onto my day job, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, he's known as the 'Conscience of the Senate.' Quite a moral man. Quite a decent man. Conscience of the -- well, no wonder he wants to get out of there and be vice president. It's gotta be pretty lonely being the conscience of the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One guy out of a hundred -- that's like being a piano player in the whore house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's a very slow news week. Oh, I'm gonna miss Clinton. You got Orthodox Jews, you got Baptists running, this is awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today -- true story -- that Senator Joseph Lieberman has written five books. He's written five books, this guy. And -- yeah, which is impressive. Very impressive, and after hearing about this, George W. Bush said, 'Big deal. Anyone can write five books. It's reading five books that's hard. That's when you get in trouble.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;They released the television ratings last week. It turns out that seven times more people watched the show 'Survivor' than watched the Republican convention. Seven times, that's right. Yeah, and get this -- to make sure the same thing doesn't happen during the Democratic convention, Al Gore says he's going to catch a lot of fish and walk around naked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At a political event over the weekend, a woman mooned George W. Bush, and the phrase 'raise the minimum wage' was written on her butt. It's true. Yeah. And folks, not surprisingly, it was in President Clinton's handwriting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How about that Al Gore? He is living La Vida Lieberman, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore has selected Sen. Joe Lieberman to be his running mate. People are thrilled by this choice. Earlier today, I saw a couple of rabbis out on Broadway rolling a party keg right down the middle of the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here is something interesting about Sen. Joe Lieberman. If he looks familiar to you, back in the 80s, he was the father on Alf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Republicans are so worried about the selection of Joe Lieberman as Democratic vice presidential candidate, George W. Bush is thinking about dumping Cheney and selecting actor Jerry Orbach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Democrats are so impressed with Lieberman they are urging Lieberman to dump Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Experts and pundits are calling this the biggest breakthrough since I selected Paul Shaffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Now we are finding out more and more about Sen. Joe Lieberman. . He likes to spend his weekends locked in the house reading the Torah. It's like I have a twin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you remember President Clinton? With all of the attention Gore is getting.he is a little testy, a little grumpy. Earlier today, down in the Oval Office, and aide walks in and Clinton snapped, he said, 'Can't you see I've got somebody under my desk?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I know you're excited today. They saw a Jew in Nashville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I'm sure you saw that on the news. The Gore-Lieberman ticket kicked off officially today in Nashville. That's, of course, Al Gore's home state, Tennessee. I'm not sure if they're that familiar with the Jewish culture down there in Nashville. I don't know how much they're used to seeing it. There was a huge crowd there that turned out for the event. But a lot of them said they came to see Lieberman's nutty neighbor, Kramer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;But I didn't know this. Al Gore used to serve as Lieberman's 'shavez goy.' Did you hear that? Do you know what a shavez goy is? I did not know this. A shavez goy is someone who performs chores for a Jewish person whose Orthodox -- Lieberman is Orthodox -- on the Sabbath. Simple things like turning on a light, that they can't do. . And in exchange, now, Lieberman has taken over some things and done tasks that Gore couldn't do. For example, calling the President an adulterer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Apparently, this ticket, this Gore-Lieberman ticket, is working because Bush, you know the little Bush kid running for President, he had a 19- point lead the other day. It is now down to 2. Wow. Whatever, but -- but this is the first time in history a Jew has knocked 80% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Speaking of Bush, we mentioned this yesterday, but tomorrow, scheduled, not just one execution, but two -- down there in Texas. It's a twilight double header. And there's a bit of a controversy because one of the people they're going to execute is mentally retarded. And some say that this is cruel. George W. Bush said today no, that he's just being inclusive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Texas had two executions scheduled for tonight. Double executions, oh boy. They have so many executions in Texas now, the last meal is family-style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, I guess, one of the convicts allegedly was a mentally retarded guy. Did you hear about this guy? Bush executed a guy with an IQ of what? 63? Turning his back on one of his own.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, being praised for picking Joe Lieberman as his running mate. You know, Lieberman is known for being one of the most moral and devout men in Washington. Which is kind of like being the smartest guy on the Jerry Springer Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You can tell Al Gore has a great deal of respect for Lieberman's Orthodox faith. Gore said today he would no longer take illegal campaign contributions from both the beef industry and the Dairy Council -- at the same fundraising dinner. They will keep them separate now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The head of the NAACP in Dallas is in trouble. I meant to tell you, the head of the NAACP in trouble for making anti-Jewish remarks about Joe Lieberman. This proves how times have changed. You see? You can be a redneck now regardless of race, color or creed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Pat Buchanan being rather sly. His campaign manager said he has decided on a running mate but he doesn't want to say who just yet. He wants to call the guy up to the podium during the convention and pull his hood off and reveal, of course, who it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, historians lifted a Civil War era submarine, the 'Hunley,' off the coast of South Carolina, where it had sunk in 1864. When I heard a Civil War relic was being lifted out of the water, I thought, 'Oh, my God, Strom Thurmond slipped in the bathtub again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, at a big political event, Al Gore promised that he would not say anything negative about George W. Bush and Dick Cheney during the campaign. Isn't that something? I thought that was pretty interesting. Not going to do it. Yeah, yeah. Then -- then Gore said, 'Just kidding. They're douche bags.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The Bush campaign, they keep using the code words, 'They want to restore honor and dignity to the White House.' (Which means) 'You know who got you know what.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;That's the reason Al Gore got Lieberman on the ticket. Because their version of that is, 'Hey, we're going to make the White House kosher again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;You should know, these are not the only people running for president. Pat Buchanan, as we speak, is trying to marshal his troops, and I do mean troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;And in Palm Springs this week, today, yesterday, the Stonewall Democrats are meeting. They are the gay and lesbian Democrats. They have their own convention. And you can tell it's a gay and lesbian convention because all the guys are laying out by the pool and all the women are playing golf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Here's what some party should address -- too much big government in our lives. Today, in Ohio -- do you know this? A law goes into effect where if you want to buy five or more kegs of beer, you have to register the location of the party and there is a five-day waiting period. Now, as a Libertarian, I for one am incensed that they're treating alcohol like guns. And if you think I'm upset, you should see Charlton Heston. Wow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;At the White House today, President Clinton give the Medal of Freedom to a number of people (including) Jesse Jackson, who said he had mixed feelings about the Medal of Freedom. On one hand, he said it's a great honor. On the other hand, it makes him look like Al Sharpton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, Joe Lieberman continue to campaign around the country. These two are very much alike. As you know, Lieberman goes to temple every week. So does Al Gore. It's a Buddhist temple -- but okay, it's still going to temple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the Democrats gathering in here in Los Angeles, preparing for the Democratic National Convention, which starts Monday. And, of course, they are a lot looser than the Republicans. They really are looser. Did you see that footage today -- all the Democrats meeting downtown? Show that footage.&quot; (A clip of a group of nudists throwing Frisbees was shown). They really know how to kick back.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Texas had a big doubleheader last night. Executed two people back-to- back. . They got the only death row that offers the buddy system down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One of the guys executed was guy with an IQ of 63. Shows you bad the Texas schools are -- he was the class Valedictorian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of people protesting the fact that the guy had an IQ of 63.  Hey, let me tell you something, if a 63 IQ is good enough to be Governor, it is good enough to get a lethal injection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In the world of politics, yesterday, on the campaign trail - - because they're really hitting the trail now -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman acknowledged that they do have some conflicting opinions. That's what they said. That's right, yeah. Apparently, Gore and Lieberman hold different views on vouchers, Social Security and bacon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It was reported today that President Clinton is going to be leaving after the first day of the Democratic convention. He's only sticking around for one day, and then he's out of there. And when asked about it, the President said, 'I'll endorse Al Gore, but I am not gonna hang around to hear him speak.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, it's day four of Liebermania!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Senator Joe Lieberman, the vice presidential candidate on the Al Gore ticket is so popular, earlier today at a meeting George W. Bush got his staff together and he said, 'Get me some Jewish friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Last night down there in Texas, they electrocuted two guys a half an hour apart. . But next time, so there's no delay, they are just going to, you know, when they have two guys they are going to have one guy sit on top of the other guy's lap and then just do both at once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I don't know if you heard this, but the entire Western US is on fire. Not a good thing, but there are incredible fires out there. They say the smoke is even thicker than the one last week at the Republican convention. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Not to worry. All of our nuclear secrets are safe in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;It's so weird that, you know, Clinton has the sex, and the rest of the country has the burning sensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;The White House announced today that they are going to have to put porn blockers on the Internet. Staff member -- staff members at the White House have been downloading porn off the Internet. I'm not kidding about this.  Most of it, they say, was being viewed after hours by the cleaning staff. And in their defense, the cleaning staff said they were just trying to identify the stains on the carpet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;A follow-up to a story we've been following all week about the executions in Texas. They did it yesterday. They executed two guys. I love this. One of the guys, his last words before they pulled the switch or gave him the injection was, 'Kiss my ass.' And Governor Bush -- he was very annoyed at this. He said today, 'You know, I try to be compassionate and this is the thanks I get.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;We have First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the show tonight. Quite an honor. We're very excited. I promised to be on my best behavior. No jokes at her expense. No jokes at her husband's expense. Good night, everybody!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ooh, record heat wave here in California. It was hot today, wasn't it? I'll tell you, I was sweating like a Democrat at the Playboy mansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This local congresswoman, Loretta Sanchez, she's having a fundraiser. She schedules it at the Playboy mansion. And Democrats are upset about this. They're upset it's the Playboy mansion, you know, of course. And they want to change it. Now she said today, she's willing to move it to a different location. But I don't think she gets it. Well, now it's at Dennis Rodman's House. That seems wrong. Doesn't seem like that's much of a step up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was hot down there in Long Beach today. It was even hotter than here. In fact, at the Reform Party convention, Pat Buchanan's delegates didn't even light their crosses. That's how hot it was, with the heat coming up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Part of the Million Klan March they got going down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And now you got George W. Bush and John McCain, they're campaigning together. They look like a happy camper, those two, don't they? They now say the fight they had during the primaries, that was just a family squabble. The last time McCain was involved in a squabble like this, I think, his plane was shot down, wasn't it? Being tortured for five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the United Nations, the world's population will soon be 9 billion. Man, people are being born faster now than Texas can execute them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See that the other night in Texas? Two guys, two guys in one night, that buddy system thing we were talking about. And one of the guys was mentally handicapped. But see, this compassionate conservatism -- you know what they did? I thought this was very nice. They arranged with the guy to get a special plate. Yeah, a handicap plate so he could park right next to the gas chamber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They don't even use lethal injection anymore. You see what they do now? Now they take guys and put them in a Ford Explorer with four Firestone tires on them and make them drive around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;To get an idea how hot it was today -- while walking to the convention center, Ted Kennedy actually won a wet t-shirt contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Guess you know by now, Los Angeles is hosting the big Democratic convention. Have you seen the -- have you seen the convention site? Or 'Fort Staples' as we call it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Scary incident today down there. I guess they were moving trees. They're moving all the trees away from the Staples Center. Actually moving the trees. I guess one of the workmen accidentally grabbed Al Gore by the ankle.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, President Clinton said Al Gore should not be blamed for Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. He said Al Gore had nothing to do with it. Thus confirming there was not a second shooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, the Democrats say that unlike the Republican convention, the Democratic convention will focus on real people. And what better place to find real people than Los Angeles, huh? . You know, people like Barbra Streisand, Hugh Hefner, Jack Nicholson, your Joe Six pack, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan made it clear yesterday. He said, 'There is no room for racists or bigots on my campaign staff.' So I guess that means they're full up. Try again next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see him Sunday? Sunday, Buchanan said the image of him as intolerant and bigoted is wrong. Buchanan said it's a lie that has been perpetrated against him by the Jewish media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Buchanan announced he has chosen an African-American woman as his vice presidential running mate. . Yeah, did you see that? In fact, did you hear his new motto - 'Once you go black, you never go back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now let me ask you something. Do you notice a trend here? I mean, first Al Gore picked a Jewish guy to be his vice president. Now, Pat Buchanan has chosen an African-American to be his vice president. See, everybody's trying to show how open-minded they are. Like today, Ralph Nader chose his running mate, a transsexual Eskimo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Fidel Castro turned 74 over the weekend. Now he's talking about how about retiring. Boy, how ironic is that? He could wind up in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Democratic Convention got underway today at the Staples Center. For those of you who get confused between the major political parties, the Democrats are the ones who are going to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton raised $1 million for his presidential library at another fundraiser. This one at the Malibu home of Barbra Streisand. For those of you unfamiliar with Barbra Streisand, she is the latest wife of noted transmission specialist James Brolin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bill and Hillary said the $1 million will go toward purchasing a pair of tickets to Streisand's farewell concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This is the Democrats' (convention). It started tonight. And you know, their thunder got stolen. Another story in the news. A Russian nuclear sub is at the bottom of the sea. They're trying to rescue it. This is a big story. It's stuck at the bottom of the sea. I also feel sorry for President Clinton because this was supposed to be his big night for him to put the past behind him and the headline tonight is 'lost sea men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;But they did start their big convention. And they weren't going to be outdone by the Republicans. They started off with the 'Star Spangled Banner' sung by a Hispanic boy. And then Janet Reno got a little drunk because half way through the song, she rushed the stage and said she was going to send the little bastard back to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I'll tell you that the scuttlebutt around this town is that the Gores are very mad at the Clintons because they -- the Clintons, Hillary and Bill -- came to town here and they are sucking up all the donation money for their own causes -- his presidential library, they raised a lot for, her Senate campaign. In fact, Gore said if it wasn't for the Chinese, he'd have no cash at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;But I'll tell you -- Hollywood loves this Gore-Lieberman ticket. I know this because today, three studios green lighted projects about a robot that teams up with a rabbi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As soon as he finished speaking, man, he was out of there. He left that convention pronto. Boom, he was gone. I guess he was trying to get some post-convention 'bounce,' he said, apparently.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But Clinton said today, for the rest of the convention, he's keeping a low profile. In fact, I thought this was very nice. He has personally volunteered to keep running over to the Playboy mansion every day to make sure there are no fundraisers going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, at the Skirball Cultural Center -- that's a place here in Los Angeles -- they had a fundraiser for Al Gore. I'm not making this up. You know what group performed? Asleep at the Wheel. They're a very good group. But with Gore's image, is that the best group to have?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But it's still better than the group they had when Clinton was there. Remember? Cherry-Popping Daddies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tonight, they're doing a tribute to Bob Dole. You know who they have? Limp Bizkit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm watching the news last night. It seems the police are moving all the hookers out of the downtown area. They want to get them all out of there so they don't embarrass the Democrats. Yeah, right. Embarrass the Democrats? Have you seen their poll numbers? Move the Democrats out. It's embarrassing the hookers at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There are reports that a Monica Lewinsky look-alike has been crashing all of these big-time Hollywood parties being held by the Democrats. Yeah, isn't this unbelievable? And I guess a lot of people are upset because five minutes after she arrives, all the food's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see her on the news? They have an actress who looks just like Monica. Boy, you thought Robert DeNiro put on a lot of weight for 'Raging Bull.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness. Did you see her? It's a good resemblance. Close, but no cigar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton has been going to a lot of Hollywood fundraisers. You know, he's collecting money for the Presidential library down there in Arkansas. The only library with a two-drink minimum, by the way. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, here's a shocking statistic. According to a recent study, 78% of all the dollar bills in Los Angeles carry traces of cocaine. Isn't that amazing? That's why George Bush is trying to raise money here. Residue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;78% of all the money has cocaine. That's unbelievable. With the Democrats in town, it also carries traces of tobacco company money, oil company money, trial lawyer money. Ooh, you got all that residue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that in preparation for her speech at the Los Angeles Democratic Convention, Hillary Clinton -- get this -- hired a makeup artist who charges $6,000 a visit. That's what they're saying. That's a lot of money. Yeah, and apparently -- apparently, the makeup artist made her look so different, President Clinton accidentally hit on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The band Rage Against the Machine played -- get this, did you know this -- they played at a protest rally. They performed at a protest rally. Yeah, and the surprising part is, the machine they're raging against is Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;It hasn't been a good day for Paula Jones. She got a recall notice from Firestone for all four tires on her home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Thursday night at the convention, the stage will be set for the biggest speech of Al Gore's life. Also scheduled for Thursday night, America's best night of sleep ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Tonight was the night the Latino fundraising event was supposed to be at the Playboy mansion but they had to move that to B.B. King's Blues Club. The Playboy mansion is a little too controversial for the Democrats. . They had to move that. And Hugh Hefner was hurt but he says he's still okay with the Democrats. Even tonight, he is standing firmly behind as many women as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Well, tonight was what they called liberal night at the Democratic convention. Four Kennedys spoke including Ted Kennedy. Ted spoke. He made an impassioned speech but I thought he took a little bit of a cheap shot. He blamed Chappaquidic on those damn Firestone tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;And Bill Bradley spoke. Bill Bradley spoke, I'll tell you the crowd was electrified, literally with cattle prods so they'd stay awake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;This is a very liberal delegation that goes to the Democratic convention. There are 212 gay, lesbian and bisexual delegates and one transgender delegate. I'm not kidding about that. . This is a delegate who used to be a man. In fact, President Clinton said yesterday, not only does he not feel her pain, it hurts just to think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;They asked the transgender delegate what she thought of the Republicans and she said, 'You know, that Bush is a phony. And trust me, I know a phony Bush when I see one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was so hot today, Al Gore said, 'Screw the ozone, turn up the damn air conditioning!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, I was sweating like Bill Bradley trying to follow Jesse Jackson at the convention last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you watch Jesse? Vintage. Vintage Jesse last night. Had all the things going. You know, this guy is a great speaker. And he was really on his stage last night, except for one point. Did you see him? Like he said, the Republicans tried to fool us with 'inclusion illusion.' I thought, that's good. 'Inclusion illusion.' And then he said the Democrats have a 'dream team' with the 'real deal' and we'll 'get more with Gore.' And then he said, 'Lieberman is okay.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore's going to give his big speech tomorrow night. And he's in a tough position, because his strategy -- you gotta find the perfect compromise between liberals and conservatives within his own party. Like liberals, they love the environment, of course. And conservatives, they love the death penalty. So tomorrow night, Al Gore will introduce his new plan for a solar-powered electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The other night, the Democrats had a fundraiser here in LA. They had a fundraiser for Al Gore. . But the group they had playing for Al Gore was Asleep at the Wheel. Now, when you're running for president, you don't hire a group called Asleep at the Wheel. Well, did you see who the Reform Party had? Insane Clown Posse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Of course, the Democrats say they came to Los Angeles to find the real people. Real people? Huh? You can't even find real breasts in LA. Shut up, real people. What are you talking about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, boy. Bad day today for the LAPD. Today, Firestone recalled all the rubber bullets. Yeah, apparently they're malfunctioning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And these rioters, they continue to protest outside the convention center. You know what I don't understand? You see these protesters out there and they're wearing jungle camouflage. Where? There's no jungle in LA. Why are you wearing jungle camouflage? You know, if you want to blend in LA, shouldn't the camouflage be, like, Starbucks cups with screenplays stuck on them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, when Jesse Jackson spoke at the convention, Jackson referred to the Republican Party as 'the inclusion illusion.' That's what he said. Yeah, and when asked what he meant by 'inclusion illusion,' Jackson said, 'Sorry about the confusion, I think I have a contusion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday President Clinton flew to Michigan to meet Al Gore for the ceremonial passing of the baton, which is what they do. That's right. Yeah, apparently, Gore took the baton from the President, and then boiled it in hot water because he didn't know where it had been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Campaign aides to Al Gore -- the people that help him, his campaign aides -- say that Gore has insisted on writing his entire nomination speech by himself. That's what they say. Yeah, which is fine with them, as long as Gore lets someone else deliver it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, President Clinton went to McDonald's, and the 18- year-old woman who waited on the President refused to charge him for his sandwich. Isn't that sweet? It's very nice. Yeah, yeah, she told the President, 'Don't worry about it, I'll make the money back tomorrow when I file a sexual harassment suit against you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;I don't know if you saw this, Mr. Al Gore made surprise visit to the stage. This is not usually done. The candidate is not seen until the last night. He made a surprise visit. This is the first time in history anybody ever said, 'Wow, it's Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Actually, George W. Bush said he would have done the same thing, but he didn't want to give Dick Cheney a heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;But it was an exciting night, the third night of the Democratic National Convention. Stevie Wonder sang the national anthem. His blindness never came up, except for one moment afterwards. Stevey said, 'I can't see a Jew as vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Well, it was also the big night for Mr. Joe Lieberman, our vice presidential candidate for the Democrats. He made his big speech. His quote that will be remembered, he said, 'It's not just the size of America's feast, it's how many people we can fit around the table.' You know, it's always food with these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;And the speech seemed to be very well received. I don't know if this is indicative of anything. But George W. Bush took a page out of his father's book. He said we need a kinder, more gentile nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier tonight, Al Gore delivered his big acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. That's the big story. So I would like to take a second and just say to all the people who watched at home, wake up!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, actor Tommy Lee Jones spoke at the convention. . .. And apparently, he spoke because he was -- did you know this? He was Al Gore's roommate for four years in college. That's a true story. Yeah, and Tommy Lee Jones said that he stayed roommates with Gore all four years because the first three years, he thought Gore was a walk-in closet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During his speech at the convention last night, Joe Lieberman talked about how his father once owned a liquor store. No, that's what he talked about. Yeah, and after hearing this, George W. Bush said, 'Hey, I thought his name sounded familiar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, folks, the conventions are over. O.J. Simpson has stopped doing interviews. Kathie Lee has quit. It is safe to turn on your TVs again. Welcome home! Welcome back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, last night I'm watching a rerun of the HBO show, you know, 'Sex and the City.' I realized halfway through, this isn't 'Sex and the City.' It's Al and Tipper Gore, on stage. Woo!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see Al 'The Tongue' Gore, last night, huh? Did you see those two? They're making out in the middle of the convention. Even the crowd was going -- like, they went from chanting &quot;We want Gore' to 'Hey, get a room, will ya?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I felt sorry for the daughters. You don't want to see your parents making out. 'Stop, stop, mom and dad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you watch the speech? I thought he did a nice job. I think we saw some changes. I think we saw a change from a stiff, wooden Al Gore into a softer, cardboard Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore said last night he couldn't possibly thank, by name, all those responsible for getting him where he is today. Well, sure, those Chinese names are hard to pronounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, his speech was interrupted 108 times by applause and 215 times by loud snoring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't want to imply that it was dull, but halfway through, Al's people had the LA police come in and shoot rubber bullets into delegates to keep them awake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And last night both Al and Tipper Gore mentioned that they fell in love on the night of his senior prom, even though they went with different people. They went with other people. That's true. They went with other people and fell in love at the prom. Now, see, that doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, they're trying so hard to show how Al Gore is not like Bill Clinton. The first thing they do is talk about how he stole another guy's girl. It doesn't get more Clinton than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know whose birthday is tomorrow? Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton. He'll be 16 years old tomorrow. You know, those hormones, they're raging at that age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was reported today, although Hillary is living in New York, Bill is buying a seven-acre estate in Hot Springs, Arkansas. I hope this doesn't let people think maybe there's problems in marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And 56-year-old Newt Gingrich -- Newt Gingrich got married tonight for the third time. He married his 33-year-old former assistant. Gingrich promised to love, honor and obey until death do they part -- or until he meets another assistant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the divorce trial, I guess, Gingrich was seeing this new wife while he was still married. That's the difference between Democrats and Republicans, Republicans marry their mistresses, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Do you think Newt's getting married because he's in love or because he just wants more cake?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Historic day in Atlanta, Georgia, today. One of the largest condom manufacturers in the world closed its doors this week. Well, if that isn't proof that this is the end of the Clinton era, then I don't know what is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic convention is finally over. The convention -- back to reruns of &quot;Heehaw' for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Let me explain what happened. Last night was the big finale, if you can call anything involving Al Gore a finale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I don't know if you saw this or if you heard about it, but this is really strange. Last night, when Al Gore finally took the stage at the Democratic National Convention, he grabbed Tipper Gore and gave her a huge open-mouthed kiss on the lips. Did you see this? It's amazing. Yeah, apparently, Tipper hadn't been kissed like that since Monday night, when President Clinton took the stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Throughout the entire convention, security personnel confiscated TV reporters' hair spray because it's a flammable substance. That's true. Yeah, which explains why all week, Ted Koppel looked like Don King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush has challenged Al Gore to three debates. That's the latest. Yeah, and in preparation for the debates, George W. said he's been practicing the phrase, 'I know you are, but what am I?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Pat Buchanan is recovering and doing fine after having surgery to remove two gall stones. . I thought you should know that, yeah. Yeah, apparently, Buchanan had the emergency surgery after tests revealed that the gall stones were gay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess, on his birthday, President Clinton was visiting a Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in Lake Placid, New York -- you know what I'm talking about? A young woman asked him to autograph her shirt -- asked Clinton to sign her shirt. And she pulled off the shirt. Yeah, she took it off, stripped down to her bra. And, I guess, right away she was wrestled to the ground. Not by the Secret Service, by Clinton.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Clinton's like a rock star. Can you imagine women going up to Nixon, 'Hey, Dick.' He's like a rock star, now. Not even the Stones get that any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, actually, they're giving her a hard time. I can understand why she ripped her shirt off. With Clinton's track record, she probably didn't want to risk getting it all stained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tell you something, I'm surprised Clinton didn't try to sign her pants, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know Clinton was going, 'I was so close. Four, five more months. God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, now neck and neck -- not with Bush, with Tipper, did you see those two?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Man, did you see 'hot monkey love' Gore out the other night? A lot of analysts say Al Gore's acceptance speech last night hit a home run. Which I can understand, with the way he kissed Tipper, halfway to third base right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, Gore is doing so well now, even Bush said he's considering making out with Tipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday, on Meet the Press -- you all watch that, right? The chairman of Al Gore's campaign said, 'Al Gore can stand up to the special interests. You know, as long as they don't offer him any money or anything, but he can stand up to them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Al and Joe Lieberman now on a trip to the Midwest on a riverboat. They didn't want to make the trip by riverboat, but, I guess, they had tickets to fly United, and the riverboat was faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan taking it easy after having his gallbladder removed. Buchanan said he felt right at home after he woke up wearing that white sheet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Well, the presidential race seems to be tightening quite a bit.  Democrats doing very well now. Apparently, the convention did a lot for them.  Okay. Finally, it was a good convention. In fact, the LAPD today was bragging that they kept things under very good order. No, truly, they said they only had to turn the fire hoses on once. And that was to separate Al and Tipper Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Speaking of which, did you hear the little bit of controversy that happened to President Clinton? He's on vacation. He was signing autographs. He signed a woman's t-shirt yesterday -- and she whipped it right off. She was wearing a bra. But, I mean, she whipped it right off and then the Secret Service arrested her. And Clinton was very nice about it. Not only did he ask that she not be arrested, he then offered to sign her pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;According to the Constitution, in the event of a tie during the actual election, the winner will be determined by a three-hole golf playoff and Tiger Woods will be our next president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton received a birthday surprise over the weekend when an autograph seeker flashed him during his vacation in Lake Placid. The young woman was quickly wrestled to the ground by President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore, shot up from the polls since he gave Tipper that big kiss. Before the next speech, Al and Tipper are going to engage in a little light petting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I think the kissing thing may have gone to Al Gore's head, though. You hear his latest challenge to Bush? He wants to tongue wrestle him. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know. It's like tonsil hockey. But he's trying to keep that momentum. I think he picked that up from Clinton. I think some of Clinton is rubbing off on Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a little word of warnings though. Keep this in mind. If you do kiss a politician, you're not only kissing him. You're kissing every butt that he's kissed in the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And George W. Bush also out on the campaign trail. But you know, I -- he's still a little green. I still don't think he has a full grasp of the world issues. Like in his speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars today. He said as commander in chief, he won't rest until our troops are brought home from Kosovo, Haiti and Honolulu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's an interesting story. It seems researchers have used genetic engineering to make polygamous mice monogamous. That means mice who would normally have a large number of sex partners have been genetically engineered to be faithful to just one mouse. And today, President Clinton called for a ban on human testing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, speaking of Clinton. I guess you all saw that news the other day when Clinton was up in Lake Placid. He signed a woman's shirt. She pulled it off, right over her head. Now, Clinton says after he leaves office, he's thinking of traveling around the country signing autographs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;More information came out today about the woman. She says she wasn't trying to shock anyone. She says it wasn't her purpose. Apparently, she had met Clinton before and he didn't remember her and she was trying to refresh his memory. Remember these?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;A big study released today. This is fascinating. See if you can follow this: If you were to lay every woman in America end to end, you'd be a Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;John McCain, cancer free. Isn't that good news? Mr. McCain, as you know, he had skin cancer, he announced last week. He went to the hospital yesterday. Apparently, they got it all. They said he's cancer free. They sent him home. He does, doctors say, still have a little pain in his jaw. But they said that is mostly from trying to campaign for Bush with a straight face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: Bush and Gore &quot;both spoke at the VFW this week. Yesterday was Bush's turn, today Gore. And they're firing these shots at each other. Bush said our military is not ready. And Gore said today, 'Oh, yeah, but I was in Vietnam, and you weren't.' And now Bush shot back, he said, 'Yeah, but my VP, Dick Cheney has a purple heart.' You know, an actual purple heart. And he said -- he said your VP, Lieberman is Jewish, and the Jews are known for avoiding drafts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Each contestant&quot; on CBS' Survivor show &quot;lost over 25 pounds.  25 pounds. In fact, the girls on the show got so skinny, Clinton said he stopped watching weeks ago. 'It's not fun anymore. It's not fun anymore.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A little Quayle moment out on the campaign trail today. At a fundraiser in Des Moines, George Bush said, 'When we carry Iowa in November, it'll mean the end of four years of Clinton and Gore.' And people were snickering, you know, four years. But Bush's campaign manager explains it. He explained the mistake. He said Bush was holding a microphone at the time. So he could only count with the one hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Pat Buchanan's running mate, Ezola Foster.This is the kind of stuff I love. It seems she once collected workmen's comp money for a whole year for a mental illness she didn't have. She said she was mentally ill, but she wasn't, and she collected the money. There's a first. A Reform Party candidate who isn't really nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;We found out who won Survivor. Good, yes. Yeah, that was the big news. That's what everybody's talking about. 52 million people watched this, even the presidential candidates have tried to jump on the bandwagon. Now Bush today said that he's going to try to restore honor and dignity to the 'Big Brother' house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;Figures are in on the Clinton defense fund, his legal defense fund. Many people -- I am among them -- think he has been treated unfairly. Took $1 million this year. They have $8 million. A lot of people gave because they thought he was treated unfairly. Others just wanted to stop the mailings. You know, because these mailings would come and they would show President Clinton with the words, 'Won't you please help me to get off?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher: &quot;A spokesman for the White House today about this said, 'You know, it's just a shame that being a fat guy with no pants pays so much less in Washington, DC, than it does on CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a scary story. Maybe you heard about this. Last Friday, a meteorite passed within 2.4 million miles of the earth. Giant asteroid. Guess it was pretty big, because today, George W. Bush referred to it as a 'major league asteroid,' I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Let's check in on the latest political comments from George 'Dice' Bush, yeah.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you catch his Def Comedy Jam there in Illinois, that little comedy bit? Oh, I bet that was good. I don't know if you know about this, but I guess Bush didn't realize his mike was on, and he used a certain term to refer to a reporter from the New York Times. I can't repeat here. This is Hollywood, not Washington. We don't use that kind of language. I can't repeat it what he called the guy. Let's just say it rhymes with brass pole, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's going on? I think Bush is starting to lose it. Today, he called the guy who draws the comic strip -- you know, Family Circle? He called him a son of a bitch. What's that all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Bush says today he is not afraid of an open primary and he is not afraid of an open debate. The only thing he's afraid of -- an open mike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But here's something I did not know. Did you know this? Every time George W. Bush calls someone a nasty name, do you know Susan from 'Survivor' gets a royalty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, Bush and Gore are still arguing over where and when to hold the presidential debates. I guess Bush wants the debates to be on HBO, so that way he could swear all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This sums up politics in America. You got George W. Bush calling people an ass. You got Al Gore saying he's going to kick ass. You got Clinton out there grabbing ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, if Dick Cheney is elected vice president, he will forfeit all the stock options he has in this company he worked for, which would bring him over $40 million. $40 million. So if he wins the election, he gets a job that pays him about $200,000 a year. If he loses the election, he makes $40 million. How hard do you think he's going to be studying for those debates, huh? If he wins, he'll be calling Bush a brass pole by the end of the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton was in Colombia last week to support the fight against the drug cartels. Clinton said, 'The war on drugs in Colombia is not Vietnam.' Well, of course not. He actually went to Colombia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And the incoming President of Mexico met with President Clinton and Al Gore last week. And he's asking for more open borders between Mexico and the US. More open borders? How much more open can it be, huh? I mean, it's pretty much a bad game of 'Red Rover' now, isn't it? 'Red Rover, send Juan over!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Next Tuesday, NBC, my happy little network that underpays me, has scheduled a special -- did you hear this? -- prime time edition of Meet the Press. And they've invited Al Gore and George W. Bush to hold their first debate. That's the news. That's right. Yeah, and, of course, you know, normally Meet the Press airs Sunday mornings, but that's when George W. watches his cartoons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Over the weekend, a famous modeling agency, one of the biggest modeling agencies, was broken into and the phone numbers and addresses of several supermodels were stolen. That's true. Yeah, folks. And, apparently, much like the Watergate scandal, this break-in also leads directly back to the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you see the price of gas jumped nine cents the last couple of days in California? Nine cents. It's gotten so bad, today, George W.  Bush called the Exxon gas station over here, called them a major league gas hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, let's see what's going on with George W. Yeah. George W. Bush, or as the kids call him, 'Old Dirty Candidate.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's my favorite story of the week. I'm sure you know this by now. On Monday, an open microphone caught George W. Bush using a profanity to describe a reporter from the New York Times. Good news for Bush, it was a two- syllable word, so it's a step up. Doing better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, I think -- I think he did it on purpose. I think it was a clever ploy, trying to get the rap vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I wanted to check on this guy. I wanted to see, this reporter -- what was his name, Adam Clymer, is he a major league, whatever? I called the New York Times, they sent me his card. This is, you know, all the reporters have cards. I guess -- you know that now. This is the actual guy, get a shot right there. That's Adam Clymer, right there. And see, look, it says on the back. Apparently, Bush was right - 'Major League -- six years.' 'Minor -- two years.' Two years in the minors, so apparently...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, there's a lot of arguing between Bush and Gore. Where and when these debates are gonna be. Gore doesn't want them on cable, he wants them on network. Bush wants -- I don't know what it is. Anyway, but George W. Bush said today he plans to show up for a debate Tuesday night at NBC's Meet the Press whether Al Gore is there or not. Bush says he'll debate an empty chair if he has to. Be careful, he could lose that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is every candidate's worst nightmare. Seems while Hillary Clinton was campaigning in New York City, a woman tried to approach her. Tried to approach Hillary, and I guess she looked threatening. She bit a Secret Service agent. . Secret Service was trying to stop her from getting to the First Lady. And the woman who bit her -- a woman who bites -- that's dangerous for Hillary. Oh, my God, think how much worse it would have been if it was Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All the candidates announcing their drug programs now. George W. Bush announced his today -- $158-billion drug plan for seniors. $158 billion for drugs. That's almost twice as much as he spent on drugs on himself back in the '70s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know whose birthday it is today? Not today, this week, actually. Russian Czar, Ivan the Terrible. All read about Ivan the Terrible? See, that shows you, politicians were very smart back then. Calling yourself Ivan The Terrible. Think about it, how can your opponent run a negative campaign against you when you admit in your own ad that you're terrible?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Gore and Bush still -- can you believe this, they're two adults -- they still cannot come to an agreement as to the format of their debates. They cannot agree on this. Yeah, apparently, the latest is Gore wants the debate to be 90 minutes long, and George W. keeps saying, 'No way, it should be an hour and a half.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, George W. Bush unveiled his drug plan for senior citizens. This is the big news. His drug plan for senior citizens. That's right, yeah, George W.'s plan is that seniors should refuse to answer any questions about whether or not they've ever taken drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;They're having the millennium summit over there at the UN.  . There were eight dictators in New York City today. Well, nine if you count Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Fidel Castro is also here. Fidel will address the gathering at the UN. And he's also in town to pick up parts for his 1955 Pontiac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think it was last week George W. Bush said that he hopes to restore honor, dignity and decency to the White House. Nice going, a- -h---.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;(Bush) called a reporter for the 'New York Times' a 'major league a--h--- .' And you know, I thought that title belonged to George Steinbrenner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Bush really is in a lot of trouble now because it turns out you cannot call somebody a major league a--h-- without the expressed written consent of Major League Baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Chelsea Clinton. . She's dating a White House intern. Boy, she's all Clinton, isn't she?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;So Chelsea's new boyfriend is a White House intern and that means apparently the only Clinton not dating an intern is Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I had a strange thing happen to me on the way to work this morning. It was not so strange. I'm on the freeway. I accidentally cut a guy off, okay? I mean, we've all done that. You know, you're drifting over. The guy's screaming at me, yelling obscenities, rolls the window down. Then I realize, oh, it's just the Bush motorcade coming through. Apparently, he's practicing for his next speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And earlier this week, Al Gore introduced his new economic plan. It's like this book, it's, like, 300 pages. Very complicated. See, I like the Bush economic plan, a lot simpler. Under the Bush plan, the way that things work is every time he swears, he puts $5 in a cookie jar. In four years, the national debt will be paid off like that. We're home free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;That's my favorite story, when he called the New York Times reporter, I can't say -- it rhymes with brass pole.  He called him a major league 'brass pole.' But Bush -- you know, I thought he'd apologize. You know how they always go, 'I regret ' he didn't even apologize. In fact, today, his new book just came out. This just hit stands today. It's 'A is for ***' by George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you right there, that's the difference between George Bush and Bill Clinton right there. See, Clinton never says four-letter words. He performs them. He acts them out. He's a doer, not a talker. That's the difference right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Republican Vice Presidential nominee Dick Cheney now being criticized for donating less than 1% of his income to charity.  Less than 1%.  Isn't that unbelievable? You want to hear how cheap he is, last year, Cheney only gave a nickel to the March of Dimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He not only's got a weak heart, it's tiny, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush said today he's very happy with his choice of Dick Cheney as vice president. In fact, today, he called Cheney a major league asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As I mentioned, Castro was in New York this week, as you just saw. He would have been here sooner, but I guess it was low tide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And you see that? Clinton ran into Castro. I think it's the first time a world leader has ever spoken to Castro -- I mean, an American President has spoken to Castro. They shook hands. They exchanged a few words. Then Castro told him, 'You know, that's not what you're supposed to do with a cigar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what the most valuable internet domain name is? It's www.business.com. Some guy registered that name. He sold it for $7.5 million, just the name. No company. Just the name. You know the least valuable Internet name? Janetrenoshowercam.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;At a campaign rally yesterday, vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman rode around on a motorcycle. It's a big story. Yeah, he was riding around. Yeah, afterwards when asked about it, Lieberman said, 'I can ride on a hog, I just can't eat one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush is gonna make an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Apparently, yeah, George W. agreed to appear, on the condition that Oprah doesn't try to get him to read any books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I have kind of an announcement to make before we get too far into the show. I would like to apologize for last night's show. I didn't know the microphone was on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you enjoying the Millennium Summit? They got all of the world leaders in town over at the UN.  You know, Fidel Castro is in town and when every he comes to New York City he goes crazy, this guy. I'll bet you right now he's back in his hotel room enjoying the eight dollar dirty movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I saw Castro earlier today walking down the street and a woman runs up to him and she says, 'Rabbi, what do you think of Joe Lieberman?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Castro loves the hotel. He's staying over there in the Waldorf and he loves it so much, as a matter of fact, the only way they are going to be able to get him out of his suite is a pre-dawn raid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Castro is very impressed with American television.  The only television show in Cuba that's popular at all, I believe, is called, 'Who Wants To Win A Live Chicken?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush has also had a big day. He addressed the Millennium Summit of major league a--h---s.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Rap star Eminem won best video at the MTV awards last night.  In his acceptance speech, he thanked George W. Bush for bringing swear words into the mainstream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;What else? George W. Bush has a new campaign slogan - 'Is this on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is an actual George W. Bush bumper sticker - 'Real plans for real people.' This replaces the one they had last week - 'Major league plans for major league ***.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know, Bush and Gore still haggling over where and when to hold the debates. Oh, I'm so excited, I can't wait to see these. I guess Al Gore turned down Bush's offer to debate on CNN's Larry King Live,' because Gore claims a lot of people don't get CNN. And Bush said today, 'Hey, I don't get CNN either, but the staff explains it to me later.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you heard, more bad news -- this has not been a good week for George W. Bush. Today, I guess he was having lunch at the Jack-in- the- Box drive-thru, lost the debate with the big clown head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton now admits that, yes, he did run into Fidel Castro at the millennium summit, but the encounter lasted just a few seconds. In fact, it was so brief, if it had been a woman, it would have been qualified as a quickie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gas prices here in California went up ten cents this week. Isn't that up believable? But thanks to Firestone tires, nobody's driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Firestone executives flew to Washington this week for their big meeting with Congress. Well, of course they flew, they're not gonna drive. They may be incompetent, but they're not idiots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Nancy Reagan has written a touching book that has all her love letters from Ronald Reagan over the years. It was very nice. She said today, oddly, while she was going through all the love letters, she found three of them from Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to costume sellers -- this is true -- according to costume sellers, the mask of the presidential candidate that sells the most at Halloween usually wins the election. Isn't that weird? Whoever's mask sells the most usually wins. So in a related story, George W. Bush is considering changing his name to Batman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Iraqi newspapers announced yesterday that Saddam Hussein is planning to build a monument in Baghdad to commemorate the Gulf War. That's right. Yeah, a spokesperson from the Pentagon said the monument's a great idea and they can't wait to blow it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Are you excited about the big Millennium Summit? They had 150 world leaders from all over the planet here at the UN taking part. . Whenever the leaders from around the world come to New York City, they go nuts. For example, I saw Castro earlier today getting his beard trimmed at Supercuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Castro addressed the UN group, and it was a very important speech for Castro. So important, as a matter of fact, he called Bruce Vilanch to get a couple of jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;At the big Millennium Summit, they had a big banquet.and I want to tell you, they had all of those people. There hasn't been so much ego and so much raw thirst for power and aggression in one room, well, I guess since the last time Hillary Clinton dined alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Chelsea, you know.she's dating a White House intern. And I don't know that this works constitutionally, but the Republicans are now trying to impeach her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But her father, the President -- how many of you remember President Clinton? He's already said that he likes the kid. And well, that makes perfect sense since Clinton never met an intern he didn't like.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Indiana coach Bobby Knight fired after he yelled at a student who called him by his last name. . Allegedly, Knight grabbed the student, cursed at him and swore at the kid. And for that he lost his job, for swearing at the kid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, there are higher standards to be a basketball coach at Indiana than there are to be Republican presidential nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Nancy Reagan has published a book containing many of her husband, Ronald Reagan's love letters. Now, Hillary Clinton -- she is planning a similar book of Clinton's love notes. In fact, she's collected over 100 from 30 different women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of people still very upset that President Clinton shook hands with Fidel Castro last week at the UN. But officials at the White House are saying the handshake was 'A momentary thing. It wasn't even planned.' Apparently, Castro came up from behind Clinton and surprised him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The White House said it was just a brief encounter. There were no body fluids exchanged. Nothing like that. No phone numbers or anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was just one of those chance meetings. It was just a chance meeting. If Hillary buys it, why not?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now, Indiana University coach Bobby Knight fired after 29 years at the school. Whoo! 29 years. That's a long time at one college. That's what it took Bush to get through Yale, so that's about right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You heard about this subliminal advertising thing today? Apparently, the Bush campaign got caught using subliminal advertising, you know, hidden messages. One of their ads attacking bureaucrats uses the subliminal message 'rats' -- in the bureaucrats, they kept flashing 'rats.' Isn't that a shame? Bush's first three-syllable letter word, gets in trouble with it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is not a good week for George W. Bush. Now, he's angrily denying a report in this month's Vanity Fair that he has dyslexia. He said today, 'Thank Dog I don't have it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore's been accused of polling voters and then using the results of that poll to write his policy statements. So this made him mad. He shot back. Today, Gore said, 'I pay no attention to the polls, and neither do 73.8% of the American people, ladies and gentlemen.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On Oprah yesterday, Al Gore went after Hollywood for our low moral values. And I think he's right. I think he's correct. There is too much sex on television. I saw a disgusting display just in prime time. Show that clip from a couple weeks ago. Look at that! Oh, God, stop!&quot; (A clip of Al and Tipper Gore's kiss from the Democratic convention was shown.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who I feel sorry for? (Ralph Nader's) Secret Service agent. How'd you like to guard Ralph Nader, huh? Every time you tell him to be careful, he's telling you, 'No, you be careful!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, it looks like Pat Buchanan will be certified to get $12. 7 million in Federal matching election funds. He's getting money from the government to run his campaign. This is historic. This is the first time reparations have been paid to the Nazis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, today in New York, the New York primary, President Clinton cast his first vote ever for his wife. Of course, while he was pulling the lever, he was thinking of another woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Olympic games begin on Friday. I read every athlete is given 51 condoms. No, this is true. . Actually, the last time anyone was given 51 condoms is when Clinton visited the Miss America pageant. Remember, Puerto Rico was there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush's campaign, just a couple of hours ago I guess, pulled one of their television ads after accusations that the ad subliminally showed the word 'RATS' imposed over Al Gore's face. That's what happened. They had to pull the ad. That's right. Yeah, Bush claims -- Bush claims the subliminal message was a mistake and that the word should have been 'A-HOLE.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday Al Gore appeared on Oprah Winfrey's show. And he was talking a lot about his personal life and stuff, his warm side. We found it now. And he told Oprah that his favorite food is Chinese. That's what he said. Yeah, and coincidentally, Gore said his favorite campaign donations are also Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yeah. An hour after you get the donation, you need more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Today in the New York Post there was a picture of Rick Lazio hugging Mussolini.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Yesterday, Al Gore appeared on Oprah winfrey. Al, you go girl!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;When Al Gore was on 'Oprah,' we learned that his favorite food is Chinese. What a coincidence. That's also his favorite fundraising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It turns out now that when Dick (Cheney) lived in Texas, he didn't vote. . All right, so he doesn't vote. On the other hand, his heart condition keeps him from having wild extra-marital sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Learning more and more about George W. Bush. Apparently each day he spends three and a half hours playing video games. . The guy's only goal in life: he wants to do really well in Tetris.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Democrats are charging that the Republicans are running this commercial with subliminal messages in it. Have you heard about this thing? It's somehow where you see briefly you see the word 'rat' in this commercial. And so George W. Bush is embarrassed, and he says no, no, no, no. The world 'rat,' he says that's a complete mistake. It's supposed to be the world a--h---.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;President Clinton and wife Hillary cast votes for the first time as New Yorkers yesterday as the first lady was forced into a Democratic primary in her bid for the Senate. After closing the curtain on the booth, President Clinton was overheard muttering, &quot;Where the hell do I put the quarters in this thing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;When asked who he voted for, President Clinton said, 'Ixnay on the otevay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;This just in, Vice President Al Gore is melting. Yes, scientists believe that Al Gore's developed what's known as drema nonfurma, where the patient's skin is in a constant state of flux between solid and liquid form. Fortunately, the condition is not life threatening and his advisors think it will make him appear more hardworking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It's hot today, man. I was sweating like George W. Bush trying to pronounce 'subliminal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, I'm starting to feel for old George. It's been a rough week for George W. Bush. This month's issue of Vanity Fair magazine claims he has dyslexia. In fact, when they asked Bush about dyslexia, he said, 'Look, I can't know every country in the world.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They asked him today if he suffered from dyslexia, and he said, 'On!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He said he doesn't suffer from it often, only when he reads. So that's not -- you know. That's -- maybe once a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore was on Oprah earlier this week, and she asked him all the hard questions. She asked Gore his favorite quote. She asked him his favorite childhood memory. And his favorite thing to sleep in. And George W. Bush is gonna be on Oprah next Tuesday, and his people say he's gonna do a lot better than Gore. Well, sure, after you watch Gore on Oprah, see, now Bush has got all the answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I love when politicians pander. Now, did you see Gore on Oprah? Like, she asked him what his favorite book was, and he said the Bible. Well there's a bold stand, huh? Imagine the courage to take on the powerful anti- God lobby in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton says his new role in his wife's Senate campaign is Cheerleader-in-Chief. That's what he calls himself, Cheerleader- in- Chief. As opposed to his old role, which was 'chief in cheerleader.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, a new book came out today about the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  This is all over the news today. I love this story. Apparently, Bill Clinton sent his lawyer, David Kendall, in to tell Hillary he cheated on her. He brought his lawyer in. Isn't that kind of odd? I mean, Clinton handled the lying himself, but he needed a lawyer to tell the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Basically, he sent his mouthpiece to tell Hillary about his mouth piece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Have you seen George W. Bush trying to pronounce the word subliminal? He pronounces the word 'subliminable.' And it makes me wonder, 'Gosh, do you think this guy is electamable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore raised $1 million in New Jersey last night at a musical gala which featured performances by Michael Bolton and Cher. Imagine how much they could have raised if Michael Bolton and Cher didn't sing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush has announced a plan to appropriate $4.9 billion for programs to clean up and repair national parks. He said the first thing on the agenda was to fill in that big hole out in Arizona.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Another scorching day.man, I was sweating like Hillary Clinton facing a Tim Russert question there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, for the first time in the New York Senate race, Hillary Clinton debated her opponent, Rick Lazio. Hillary said today it was just nice to be arguing with someone she wasn't married to for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, they asked Hillary some pretty tough questions, that one that really stumped her when Russert asked her, 'Do you know where your husband is right now?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Rick Lazio, very aggressive during the debate, he came on really strong. Like he said to Hillary, 'I'm going to eat your children! You're dead meat!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now Hillary has two reasons to hate men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And you know one thing I didn't understand? At the end, Hillary got a strange credit at the end of the debate, and I didn't -- show the end of the debates there.&quot; A clip of the end of the debate was shown, in which a narrator says, &quot;All guests of Mrs. Clinton stay in the fabulous Lincoln Bedroom. The Lincoln Bedroom -- catering to high-paying campaign contributors for almost eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I thought she held her own, though, but it got pretty testy. You get the feeling every time Rick Lazio laid into Hillary, Bill was sitting at home watching, going, 'Yes! Give it to her.'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And history being made this -- well, not this week, but Bill Clinton announced this week that in November, he will visit Vietnam. Guess that draft notice finally came through. It apparently got mailed a little late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And I guess there's already been a misunderstanding, like when he asked the Vietnamese if he could bring Buddy the dog, they said, 'No, no, no, we're going to provide lunch, it's fine, it's fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's a joke that almost writes itself. You know, why does Clinton get himself in this position? I'm not making this up -- when he was in New York City yesterday, President Clinton went into the Stage Deli -- you know, the famous delicatessen -- ordered a pastrami and tongue sandwich. He had the pastrami at the deli and the tongue back at the hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Why would you order a tongue sandwich? Come on. I mean, Clinton is pretty much a tongue sandwich already, isn't he, this guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new book about the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- and I love this, this is my favorite thing this week -- Clinton sent his lawyer, David Kendall, in to tell Hillary that he had cheated on her. He wouldn't do it himself, he sent his lawyer in to do it. Which is a pretty tough call, because, you know, neither one of them has ever had any experience telling the truth. They didn't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Just when you're sick of this whole Monica, you think, 'Oh, it's over.' Now HBO has purchased the rights, and they're going to do the Clinton- Lewinsky movie. And HBO said today they're promising to tell the real story, and Clinton said today he's looking forward to the film, because he's told so many stories, he can't remember which one's the real one either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't it unbelievable they're making a movie about this? And I wonder what scene the director will use to audition the actresses with, huh? 'All right, sweetheart, you be Monica, you get under the desk. All right, who's going to play Bill? Oh, what the hell, I'll be Bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, George W. Bush visited a high school here in Southern California. He only agreed to go after he was promised the teacher would not call on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How about this, shades of Nixon -- someone broke into Democratic headquarters in New York city this week, stole the list of Al Gore's campaign contributors. Stole the whole list. Luckily, it's not going to do him much good because, you know, it's all in Chinese, so luckily, he won't be able to figure it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;All this week, self-righteous Congress has been holding hearings on the entertainment industry. Washington's attacking Hollywood for destroying traditional American values. See, I don't even understand the conflict. Hollywood and Washington? Isn't that the same values? Lying, sex, drugs, greed, power, alcohol, this is what brought Washington and Hollywood together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;As you probably know, vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman is a guest. . And this is interesting. Because Senator Lieberman is a guest on the show -- this is true -- the Secret Service has been all over the building today. They've been everywhere. In fact, just before the show, two agents were down in the NBC commissary taking all of the bacon out of the BLTs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This month's Vanity Fair speculates that George W. Bush may suffer from attention deficit disorder. That's right. Yeah, the article also speculates that if Al Gore is elected, we'll all suffer attention deficit disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Top 10 Rejected Gore-Lieberman campaign slogans (presented by Al Gore): 10. Vote for me or I'll come to your home and explain my 191-page economic plan to you in excruciating detail. 9. Remember America, I gave you the Internet and I can take it away. Think about it. 8. Your vote automatically enters you in a drawing for the $123 billion surplus. 7. With Lieberman on the ticket, you get all kinds of fun new days off. Vote for us, we're going to work 24/6. 6. We know when the microphone is on. 5. Vote for me and I will take whatever steps are necessary to outlaw the term, 'Whazzzup.' 4. Gore-Lieberman: You don't have to worry about pork-barrel politics. 3. You'll thank us in four years when the escalator to the moon is finished. 2. If I can handle Letterman, I can handle Saddam Hussein. 1. I'll be twice as cool as that president guy in 'West Wing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, some of these Olympic events on NBC - 18-hour delay. Which is also the same delay a reporter gets when asking George W. Bush a question and him coming up with the answer.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You all enjoy the opening ceremonies? That was pretty good. I thought it was great how the Olympic torch -- see how they did it? They threw a Firestone tire and the whole thing blew up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, here's some Olympic trivia for you. Did you know no Cuban swimmer has ever won a medal in the Olympics? Well, all the good Cuban swimmers are in Florida, that's why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;From one of the Koreas, for the first time in 50 years workers have begun uniting the railroad between the North and South. Then on to an even tougher challenge, reuniting Pat Buchanan with reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;For those who don't remember, the Korean War ended in 1983 when Hawkeye decided to do Woody Allen movies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The Supreme Court has ruled it is now illegal to yell Firestone on a crowded freeway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Former actor Alec Baldwin says that if George W. Bush is elected he will move out of this country. Now -- if Bush can just get all the Baldwin brothers to take the same pledge, he may have a winning strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush appeared on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and apparently started weeping. . I don't think we should criticize him. I once cried on Oprah too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually I wasn't on -- I was under Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;As we reported, George W. Bush was on 'Oprah' today and while talking about his two children, he began to cry. Who says big girls don't cry?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Bush is expected to cry again in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;During his interview, Bush stressed that he was both smart and competent, adding that he must be smart and competent, he spent three years in the eighth grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;He said he will concentrate on the.undecided voters this week. I guess that means he's going to be spending time with his wife and kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bob Costas said today that because of the tape delay (for Olympic events), NBC is having to put an emphasis on story-telling. You know, kind of like Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, Al Gore's in trouble again. You know, we love Al, but, you know, he does tend to exaggerate. He was in Vegas the other day, and he told the Teamsters that his mom used to sing him a song when he was a little kid. 'Look for the Union Label,' you know that song? He said it was a childhood lullaby his mother would rock him to sleep by. 'Look for the Union Label.' The only trouble is the song was written in 1975 -- when Al was 27 years old.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You got Bush, can't remember his college years. Gore can't remember his own childhood. What drugs are these guys on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, (Gore) also said when he was a kid, his favorite singer when he was a little boy -- Eminem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you all see George W. Bush on 'Oprah' yesterday? Did you see that? He did a pretty good job. He did a pretty good job. Bush said he gave up alcohol when he turned 40 because it was affecting his memory. Couldn't remember where he put his cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Like when Oprah asked him what's his favorite gift to give? He said his favorite gift to give was a kiss to his wife. Oh, shut up! Any guy that's been married more than three years, you got a good laugh on this one. Let me tell you -- if it's your wife's birthday, and your only gift is a little kiss, well, that kiss is gonna have to hold you for a long, long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, what's this with kissing and politicians? You got Bush kissing -- you got Al Gore all over his wife. See, I miss Clinton already. At least he did all his kissing in the privacy of the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what I'm saying? At least it was under the desk.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And looks like there's some problems with Clinton and his Cabinet. They're not getting along. LA Times said today that Bill Clinton and Janet Reno never see each other socially. Really? I'm shocked. You'd think these two would be hanging all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Elton John said if he were an American, he would vote for Al Gore. And Al Gore said if he were gay, he would listen to Elton John.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;I love saying Peru. Making his first public appearance, President Fujimori electrified a crowd when he climbed up the gate of the government palace. He can face stiff competition next year's elections from Spiderman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On Oprah the other day, George W. Bush said that when he was in prep school, he remembers how smart all the other kids were, but later, he realized he had other important qualities. You know, like the ability to convince other people that he had other important qualities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Bush &quot;calls his father 'daddy.' He said, 'I'm not running on my daddy's name.' Daddy? What, is he running for president of the second grade?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And once again, Al Gore has gotten caught telling a story that wasn't true. Well, he told some Teamsters the other day -- and this is what I love -- he said that when he was a baby, his mother would rock him to sleep singing, 'Look for the union label.' He was talking to union workers, so - 'Look for the union label,' turns out the song wasn't written till 1975 -- when he was 27. So they got Bush, who can't remember what he did in his youth.  You got Gore, who remembers things that never happened in his youth. Can't we clone these two guys and come up with one person with a normal memory?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, a recent study says the more you lie, the more you sweat. And they released this tape. It's true. Take a look.&quot; (A clip of Gore sweating profusely at a campaign event was shown).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today, Gore blamed it on a 'vast Rightguard conspiracy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And earlier today, Kathleen Willey -- remember the woman who claims she was groped by the President in the Oval Office? She says she was groped by the President when she was applying for a job. She is now suing the President. And Clinton said today her case is very weak. Clinton said he offered her a job. It wasn't what she wanted, but he offered her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big story this week in the presidential race, there may be a spy in the Bush camp who has been giving George Bush's secrets to Al Gore's people. What are George Bush's secrets? How he got into Yale? That's probably about the only one I can think of.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;President Clinton released 30 million barrels of oil from our country's strategic reserves. And today, George W. Bush says he is opposed to dipping into our reserves. He said it's like smoking your secret stash before you get to the concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In the new issue of US magazine, Monica Lewinsky said she was offered $1 million to pose nude in Playboy. But she said she couldn't do it. She turned it down. Which is too bad, because she would have been Miss October, November and December.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica has been hired to be a TV reporter for a TV station in England. Is that really news? Another beefeater in London. I mean, that's not unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I guess she did pretty good during the audition. Duh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The station manager said the first time she brought that microphone to her lips, she had the job. 'You're it, baby. You got it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Inspired by&quot; the progress of peace talks between North and South Korean leaders, &quot;George W. Bush said maybe we can reunify North and South Dakota.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You probably know by now, the Clintons are coming under fire for allowing a lot of contributors to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. Something like 404 people have stayed there in the last year. In fact, Chevy Chase stayed there, Dennis Quaid, Danny DeVito, all in the Lincoln bedroom. Boy, how do you think Lincoln would have felt about that? 'Actors -- first they shoot me, now they sleep in my bed. What is that?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Is anybody happy with the candidates? Look at what we've got. We got Gore, you got Bush, you got Nader, you got Buchanan. This is like trying to find a good piece of fruit at 7-11, you know? It's not gonna happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton has got Olympic fever. Earlier today he performed a perfect dismount off an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Monica Lewisnky has supposedly been offered $1 million to pose for Playboy. That offer came from Penthouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Al Gore was on the 'Choose or Lose' program yesterday. He assured young people he would not commit US troops to war unless there was a threat to Nester.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Joe Lieberman was in a fist fight with Puff Daddy for using his yarmulke as a Frisbee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Do you remember President Clinton? . He announced this year's staggering budget reduction, but is it that staggering?&quot; (Video of Clinton): &quot;We have been able to cut the debt over the last three years by this figure. $360 in debt reduction over the last three years.&quot; Kilborn: &quot; As his term in office winds down, we hope the Clinton legacy will go from a horny bastard to a cheap horny bastard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore and George Bush spending the weekend preparing for their big debate on Tuesday. Although, I think Gore got kind of an early start.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, he's already come up with over half a dozen new things he's gonna claim he's invented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And today, they asked Bush what he thought about our State Department forcing -- you know these 10,000 Liberians? They're forcing them to leave the country. And I gotta give Bush credit. He didn't waver, he spoke right up. He said, 'Hey, without Liberians, who's gonna put the books away? How are kids gonna learn?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Monica Lewinsky back in the news again. This week, she said she turned down $1 million from Playboy magazine to pose nude. She said she would never do it. She said she wouldn't do it for all the cigars in Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush was at a Los Angeles school this week and visited with a fourth grade class. And Bush reminisced about how fourth grade was the best three years of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The Olympic ratings are so low in Salt Lake City for the winter games they're already asking for their bribe money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, are you all ready for the Presidential debate tomorrow night? Yeah, oh, yeah, this is.this is a special light weight division they put together this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the deadhead versus the crackhead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know who one of the sponsors of the debate is? Budweiser. Budweiser is sponsoring the debate. Which is kind of ironic, a brewery sponsoring two empties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush -- interesting -- he says he's going to use the same strategy he used to get through Yale University. See, once the debate starts, he's going to push his podium real close to Gore and then cheat off of his answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's the George W. Bush quote of the day.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;More and more of our imports come from overseas.&quot; Jay Leno: &quot;Did you know that? Yes, I was shocked. I was shocked. I was shocked to read just how many of our imports come from overseas. . Amazing. Almost 100%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You excited about the presidential debates? It's going to be something, ain't it? Dick Cheney is all excited. His goal for the debates is just to get through the debates without having a heart attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;President Clinton will also be watching. He's already said he'll be watching the debates while having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;But both of the candidates now, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they're in seclusion now getting ready for the big debates. I think Al Gore spent the day at the beach with his family. And I believe to relax, George W. Bush watched an execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Guess you know earlier tonight, they had the big Presidential debates. I guess the local NBC station had the option of carrying either the debates or the playoff baseball games, so do you want to watch guys lying or guys stealing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of people think Bush is not smart enough for the job. Have you heard that? Yeah, well, today they asked him about RU-486, and he thought it was a character from 'Star Wars.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, Al Gore, he's pretty sneaky, too. Remember, he used to be pro-life, now he's pro-choice. He used to be anti-gun control, now he's pro- gun control. He said he invented the Internet, and he said nobody's -- you know, forget Bush, we should have Gore come out and debate himself, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm told it's time for the George W. Bush quote of the day.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And a lot of Ralph Nader's people are upset about the debates. In fact, in demonstrators tonight, because of the lack of third party candidates, they threw TV sets into the Boston harbor to protest. . They threw TV sets in there, yeah. And what better way for environmentalists to show their support for the Green Party than dumping TVs in the ocean!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I love how judgmental people are. Like they did this poll. 92% of people said Ralph Nader had no chance, no chance of winning. They say Nader can't possibly win. Why does Nader even bother entering this thing when he knows he can't win? Yet these same people go, 'Hey, lend me five bucks, I want to buy some lottery tickets.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;73 political scholars voted Abraham Lincoln our nation's greatest President. Abraham Lincoln, nation's greatest President. And of course, Clinton was thrilled to hear this, because now he can raise the rates in the Lincoln Bedroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, Mark David Chapman, the idiot that shot John Lennon, turned down for parole. Who would have guessed it, huh? . Well, Chapman told the parole board he is no longer insane. But he didn't help his case any by wearing that 'Buchanan for President' button.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Tonight was the first Presidential debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The first one. That's right. Yeah, and apparently, after watching Gore and Bush for 90 minutes, people are wishing 'Big Brother' were still on the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The other day, President Clinton told reporters that he has no plans, no plans to write a book about the Monica Lewinsky affair. However, the President did say he wants to play himself in the movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's warmer than it ought to be right now in New York City. In fact, it was so warm today that a West Nile mosquito needed a cool drink, so it bit Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The Yankees and the Mets are both in the playoffs. So, it's a bad time for Hillary. She doesn't know who to pretend to root for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Sid you see the big first presidential debate earlier tonight right here on CBS? Unusual format. Instead of opening statements, both candidates began by French kissing their wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;This George W. Bush has got to be careful. He's got to know when to be more candid with his remarks because, you know, he's under a microscope. . Tonight, before the debate a reporter comes up to George W. Bush, and he says, 'Are you nervous?' And George W. Bush says, 'Nah, I had a couple of stiff belts. I'm fine. I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier today, George W. Bush said he has one goal for these debates. He wants to show the American people that he's presidentiamable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The first in the series of presidential debates between Al Gore and George W. Bush were held earlier tonight. Though the debates hadn't started by the time we taped this show, George W. Bush lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Before the Boston-based debate, Gore rehearsed in a quiet place never used at this time of year -- Fenway Park.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I want to clear something up before we get started. Unlike my talk show opponent, my monologue benefits all Americans, not just the wealthiest 1%, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, how about that stirring debate, last night, huh, between the two white bread prep school boys. They're calling it the 'the thriller in vanilla.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Both Al Gore and George Bush wore the exact same thing, not similar, the exact same thing. Black suit, white shirt, red tie. They sounded alike, they dressed alike, it's like the Patty Duke Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And how about Al Gore last night. Boy, he looked so life-like, didn't he? I haven't seen animatronics like that since the singing mechanical rat at the Chuck E. Cheese show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know something, did Gore have a lot of makeup on? He had so much makeup on if he had gone to the White House looking like that, Clinton would have hit on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush looked pretty good last night, didn't screw up. That's the criteria now, if you don't screw up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night George W. Bush said that he was pro-life. I bet that got a big laugh from all the guys in Texas on death row, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush accused Al Gore of using 'fuzzy math.' I think to George Bush all math is pretty fuzzy, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what I love, see Bush kept blowing his nose, wiping his nose during the debate. What better way to dispel those cocaine rumors?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I tell you, it got a little personal at the end there, when George W. Bush went after Al Gore's character. See what he said about him? Oh, man. He said, 'Al Gore, you are manipulative. If I saw you by the side of the road with vultures picking at your flesh, I wouldn't give you any of my water, I would walk right by.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the New York Post, Ron Popeel has been giving Al Gore some of that Ronco spray-on hair, you know that stuff? That's what it says -- to cover the bald spot. I'm not making that up, that's what it says. You know how it works, anybody? Men use it. The spray causes the hole in the ozone layer to get bigger. This makes the sun a lot brighter. People have to squint more, so it makes it look like you got more hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Isn't Al like the kid in school, 'Teacher, you forgot the homework. You forgot the assignment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And last night, while the debate was going on, the History Channel was showing a documentary called the History of Sex. Gee, I wonder which one Clinton was watching, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush accused Al Gore of using phony numbers. That's what he said. Yeah, and it wasn't until after the debate that someone explained to Bush that billion and trillion are actually real numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Representatives for Al Gore and George W. Bush argued over how cold the auditorium should be for the debate. That's right. Very strange. That's true. Apparently, Gore's people didn't want the room to be too warm because then he starts to decompose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;This is one of the weirdest things about the debate. The power -- this is true -- the power went out last night at the Florida hotel that President Clinton was staying at. So he had to listen to part of the debate -- this is true -- on a car radio. That's true. At least that's the story he told Hillary when she caught him in the backseat with a waitress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;It's been reported that George W. Bush is thinking about dumping Dick Cheney as his running mate and replacing him with John McCain. That's the rumor. And meanwhile -- meanwhile, Dick Cheney is thinking about dumping George W. and replacing him with Martin Sheen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today is NRA President Charlton Heston's 76th birthday. Don't mess with him. Yeah, you can tell he's getting kind of old because this morning, he made a rambling speech about the government trying to take away his gums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The first presidential debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush took place yesterday in a gymnasium at the University of Massachusetts, which was filled with 900 people. . Before the Boston-based debate, a reporter asked George W. Bush how he felt about Fenway Park. Bush said, 'I fully support the president of South Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;By the way -- election day is not until November 7, so you still have plenty of time to consider the issues and the candidates, and then leave the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I know you're all excited because they had the vice presidential debate earlier tonight. That's why everybody's all wound up here.  You know, I don't want to say that thing was boring, but today the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new pill you can take during the debates. It's called 'RU-Still Awake.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you probably know, Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman debated tonight in Danville, Kentucky. And for Kentucky, double first. Their first vice presidential debate ever and first Jewish person ever to visit Kentucky, I believe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How many saw the presidential debates the other night? Did you watch that? Did you see all the makeup Gore had on? Didn't he look like he was wearing a lot of makeup? In fact, today they fired his mortician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ol' Al got himself in a little trouble the other night. During the debate, he claimed he went to Texas -- remember he said that he went to Texas to visit fire victims? Turned out, not exactly true. Didn't visit any fire victims. He went to a fundraiser at a trial lawyer's house instead. Yeah.  But today, Gore called it an honest mistake. Boy, that's a politician for you, isn't it? Finally, he does one honest thing, and ahh, it was a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And he was a little annoying. Didn't he seem like he was on it a little bit? You get the feeling if George Bush does win this election, during the swearing-in ceremony, Al will be in the background going, 'Can I just say one more thing? I just want to finish this one statement.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush didn't look too good, either. Like when they asked him about prescription drugs, he said, 'Why do you need a prescription to get drugs?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yeah, they asked Bush about his drug plan for seniors. And he said what he would do, he would like to have more drug dealers hang around Carol's Restaurant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Bush also said if elected, he will simplify government. Well, he'll have to simplify it just so can he understand it, I think pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And President Clinton gave an interview this month to Golf Digest magazine. He's talking about how much he likes to play golf. He said golf is a lot like life. Well, I think for President Clinton, it is. Because with golf as with life, every day, you know, you can do it with a different partner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ah, ah! New nominee for hypocrite of the year. . This guy Matthew Glavine. This guy was head of the conservative legal group, the one that demanded Clinton be disbarred in the Paula Jones thing. . Remember, for that unethical behavior. The guy has resigned after he was caught fondling a park ranger and masturbating in a national park. Now, you know the rules, three strokes and you're out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;There's an electricity here in the audience, because tonight was, of course, the Vice Presidential debate, and people -- people are so excited about this debate. Who is better qualified to become Vice President and do absolutely nothing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I don't know if you saw it, but things got pretty heated. At one point, Cheney pulled out a BLT and ate it in front of Lieberman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The results are actually in from the latest polls regarding the presidential debate the other night between Bush and Gore. That's right, this is pretty interesting. 23% of Americans said they thought Al Gore won the debate. 21% said George W. Bush. And 66% said they thought the woman from Dark Angel is really hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Since the Presidential debate the other night, I don't know if you noticed, but Al Gore has been widely criticized for sighing too much. Did you notice that? While Bush was talking, I guess he was sighing a lot. In response, Gore said, 'I wasn't sighing, that was just pressure being released from my hydraulics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;The Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio Senate campaigns -- have you heard this -- are expected to spend a combined $100 million. Which makes this the most expensive Senate campaign in history. Can you believe that? Yeah. Which is such a waste, because for that kind of money, you could marry Anna Nicole Smith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Did you folks enjoy the presidential debates the other night? . This Al Gore, I mean, you got to hand it to Al Gore, he certainly can talk, can't he? Seems like he had an answer for everything, but he stretches the truth. He invokes the hyperbole, and you know, he took credit for inventing the Internet now. He's taking credit for the concept of 'Becker. '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How about Jim Lehrer? I thought he did a wonderful job of hosting the debates, although next year I hope they bring back Billy Crystal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Earlier tonight, of course, were the vice presidential debates. Just when you thought things couldn't get any more exciting. Joe Lieberman, Dick Cheney, and don't kid yourself, there's a lot on the line here for Dick Cheney. If he does not win in November, he has to go back to his $5 million a year job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I thought, the other night in the presidential debates, I thought both candidates looked very presidential. Each of them showed up with their own intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Boy, a brief cold snap over the weekend. . In fact, temperatures are so low in Texas, inmates on death row are taking turns sitting in the electric chair just to keep warm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, now criticizing those American Indians -- you know those Indians every year that try to block the Columbus Day parade? . Well, Buchanan said, 'If these Indians don't like it here, they can just go back to where they came from.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, a lot of controversy over who really discovered America. The Italians say, of course, Columbus discovered it. The Scandinavians say, 'No, Leif Ericson discovered it.' Of course, Al Gore says, no, he discovered it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore has gotten a lot of criticism this week for -- you know, at the debate, he kind of exaggerates his stories a little bit now. I mean, I understand he's written a series of children's books. Joey, hand me that, will you? This is from the 'Al Gore Golden Book' series. This is 'The Little Schoolgirl Who Didn't Have a Chair.' Remember he talked about that. This is a good one here: 'The Happy Dog that Got Cheaper Medicine than My Mother-in-law. ' . All right. 'The Woman Who Collected Cans to Buy Medicine.' That was a good one, too. And, of course, 'My Mommy's Favorite Lullabies.' Remember - 'Look for the Union Label' -- remember that one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Out on the campaign trail, Al Gore stopped into a bookstore to buy the latest selection from the Oprah Winfrey book club. In fact, he also bought a book called 'The Adventures of Pelican Pete.' So he got something for George W. Bush. I thought that was nice. And I bet he'll give it to him at the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore took a lot of criticism, too, last week for constantly rolling his eyes and sighing while Bush was talking -- remember he kept doing that? Well, he blamed it on the cameraman. He said the ground rules of the debate were they weren't going to show the guy who wasn't talking. So when was Gore not talking, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A month till the election, and I'd say these past four weeks have been the biggest challenge of George W. Bush's career. You know, he's had to pronounce both 'subliminal' and 'Slobodan Milosevic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, it's time now for our George W. Bush moment -- follow this math.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;For the first time, she's in the 15% bracket. When you add another 15% pay or 16.2% payroll tax on top of that, plus the 2. 9% -- I mean, the payroll tax and the Medicare tax, 16.4%, you end up -- you end up with a high marginal rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A lot of talk this week, too, about RU-486. Now, don't confuse this with President Clinton's vanity license plate, RU-4-69.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You ever hear of this guy named Matthew Glavine? This is a guy -- he's head of a conservative legal group. He has demanded -- demanded that Bill Clinton be disbarred for his disgusting behavior in the Paula Jones case.  Well, he has had to resign after being caught masturbating twice in public. Today, he blamed the whole thing on a vast right-hand conspiracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: Paula Jones is &quot;going to be naked in the December issue of Penthouse. Why? Why is she naked? You know, just because Clinton wanted to see her naked, why do we have to suffer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you all feel wound up over those Vice Presidential debates last night, huh? I tell you, it's really turned things around in the polls though. Like today Al Gore and George W. Bush are now behind Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They had Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman and Bernard Shaw was the moderator. If you watched this thing last night, you had a white right wing conservative guy, you had an Orthodox Jew and an African-American. Doesn't that sound like the beginning of a joke? . 'Okay, a black guy, a Jewish guy and a white guy walk into bar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;It was dull, it was so dull. In fact, today Nader and Buchanan said they demanded not to be a part of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And on Wednesday night, more than 25 million people tuned into the premiere of West Wing. It was huge. That was more than watched last night's debate. So people would rather watch made-up political stories than real political stories, which is great news for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know what's interesting, a lot of people wondering why Al Gore wore so much makeup. Didn't he look like he had a lot of makeup? What was that all about? Actually, he does this for President Clinton. That's why he wears a lot of makeup. No, let me explain why. See, when Hillary finds lipstick and smudges on his clothes, he goes, 'I was just (with) Gore all night. We had some policy issues we had to deal with.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And during the debate, Al Gore talked about a man who had to go all the way to Canada just to buy his prescription drugs, to which Bush said, 'Hey, that's nothing.' One time he had to walk all the way to Colombia to get his drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura slept at the White House last night. He said he stayed up till 4:00 in the morning with President Clinton talking about cigars. He says President Clinton has an extensive cigar collection. That's what he said. Ventura didn't smoke any of the cigars because you don't know where they've been, but apparently he has quite a large collection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;There's nothing like hypocrisy. A guy named Matthew Glavin, this guy is the head of a conservative legal group demanding that Bill Clinton be disbarred for his behavior in the Paula Jones case. They want him to step down. Well, he's resigned after being caught for the second time masturbating in public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But his friends at the legal group said 'Hey, Matthew, we're pulling for you.' So anyway, it's good to see.his friends are sticking with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Of course, Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman debated last night, and they participated -- everyone's commenting on this today. They participated in a very polite vice presidential debate. Extremely polite and cordial. In fact, both Cheney and Lieberman consistently referred to each other as 'Mr. Douchebag,' which I thought was nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;During the vice presidential debate last night, both candidates, Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney, went way out of their way not to alienate gay voters. That's right. In fact, for most of the debate, the two of them were holding hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;You're watching the 'Late Show.' This is the kind of television entertainment that Joe Lieberman has warned you about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;How many of you watched the vice presidential debates? . I thought Joe Lieberman looked very good, very relaxed standing there at the podium. And, on the other hand, I thought Dick Cheney also looked relaxed lying there on the gurney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here was the format for the debate. . They gave Dick Cheney two minutes for opening remarks, and then they gave him another 20 minutes to catch his breath and then he was fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It got a little negative towards the end. . And I thought it was bad form, Senator Lieberman calling Dick Cheney a major league putz.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;Paula Jones is going to be posing nude in 'Penthouse.' Happy Halloween.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, it's cold all over the country, even down in Texas, very cold in Texas. In fact, George Bush's teeth started chattering. Luckily, nobody noticed. They just thought he was trying to pronounce Milosevic again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Tomorrow night, the second debate between Al Gore and George Bush. You excited, huh? Oh boy. Yeah. It's 'The Liar' against 'The Fryer,' ladies and gentlemen. Yesiree Bob, the killer or the liar, which one do you want?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Less than 24 hours. In fact, I understand Al Gore, already started putting on his makeup for this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;He's going for more natural 'Cover Girl' look this time, little too much blush last time, too much blush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Experts are saying -- what did they say during the last presidential debate last week? Al Gore blinked 48 times a minute, and George W. Bush blinked over 80 times a minute. I blinked just once, at the beginning and then an hour and a half later, 'Is it over?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore being criticized for all the groaning and sighing he was doing. Remember when Bush was speaking last week, you could hear Gore going, 'ah, ah, ooh, ooh!' He kept doing that. Well, now, Gore says it's not his fault. He claims he's just having an allergic reaction to this new lip gloss that he was wearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The gloves are coming off. Like Al Gore now running an ad blaming George W. Bush for causing smog and air pollution in Texas. Bush quick to respond, he said he's switching to the new smokeless electric chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Yesterday in Sarasota, Florida, Al Gore visited a book store. I guess he wanted to go somewhere where he was sure he wouldn't bump into George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, kind of an embarrassing moment while at the bookstore. While he was there, I guess he went into the fiction section, and they had a copy of everything he said during the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, you see Boris 'buy me a drink' Yeltsin on 60 Minutes the other day? . Anyway, Yeltsin was on 60 Minutes the other night, he said he knew about Monica Lewinsky before anyone. He said he knew about it even before President Clinton. Did you see this? He said Monica was sent to the White House by the Republicans as part of a secret plan to bring down his presidency. She was sent there to have sex with the President. And today Clinton called Yeltsin and said, 'Thanks for not spoiling the surprise.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know by now it's official, Paula Jones will appear naked in the December issue of Penthouse magazine. This could turn 13-year- old boys off sex forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't want to say these pictures are bad, but they recommend an hour before you look at the pictures, you should take a Pepsid-AC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now we make fun, but apparently, I guess, they say the photos are very tastefully done. Like nowhere in any of the photos can you see her face, and I thought that was okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent interview in the New Yorker, President Clinton actually said that being acquitted in his impeachment trial was one of the highlights of his Administration. That's what he said. Yeah, the President went on to say, 'Of course, that was the direct result of the real highlight of my Administration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush recently taped -- this is true -- taped a brief interview with Nickelodeon. Apparently, it was supposed to be a longer interview, but the kids' questions were way too hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Hey, here's a real bombshell. I don't know if you heard about this. It seems Frank Sinatra's daughter, Tina Sinatra, she's on '60 Minutes,' this past Sunday. Anybody see that? I guess she has a new book out in which he says her dad, Frank Sinatra, asked the Mafia to fix the election for the Democrats in 1960. Imagine having that kind of power? In fact, Al Gore is so worried about this election, he called Frank Sinatra Jr., 'Hey, can you do anything? Can you help me out a little bit here?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, the candidates had their second debate tonight. I think Al Gore toned it down a little for this one. Did you notice? This time he had slightly less makeup than Dame Edna.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, these debates are like a fashion show. Like Bush, he has the brains of a supermodel, and Gore's got the makeup of one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And, of course, both these men say they're going after the education vote. Like Al Gore says he wants to reduce class size down to maybe 19 or 20 students, and Bush said that is not good enough. He said he will not rest until he can reduce class size to zero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, oh, it's time for another George Bush moment. The George Bush quote of the day.&quot; Bush was shown saying, &quot;Laura and I are here in Eastern Tennessee to ask you to help turn out that vote four days from today.&quot; Leno: &quot;Yeah, how many are gonna vote on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the latest polls, voters feel George Bush is more honest than Al Gore. I got to admit, we do -- George W. Bush is honest. You know, he once walked 50 miles in his Texas heat just to pay a drug dealer who accidentally undercharged him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I saw a commercial the other day for that new Spike Lee movie, about the guy who tries to bring back the minstrel shows. You know the ones where black guys are in black face -- then I realize, it's just a Pat Buchanan campaign ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And history was made yesterday at the White House when Bill Clinton became the first American President to meet with a top official from North Korea. I guess everything's going great until Buddy the dog came into the room and the Korean gentleman went, 'Great, lunch!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In an interview in this week's New Yorker -- this is kind of interesting -- Bill Clinton said his style of being President changed the way Americans view the Presidency. Oh, boy. Now it's just another way to meet chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I wanna wish happy 25th wedding anniversary to Bill and Hillary. This is their special day. And, you know, sometimes you look at those two, and it's like their still on their honeymoon. She's crying, and he's still waiting to see her naked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula Jones will appear naked in the December issue of Penthouse magazine. Well, guys, if you're thinking about getting that laser eye surgery so you can see better, might as well want to postpone it till January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Paula Jones' pictures are supposed to be pretty wild. It's the first photo shoot they've ever done with a girl straddling a possum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Today is President Clinton and Hillary's 25th wedding anniversary. Isn't that nice? That's right, yeah. Reportedly, the two of them plan on having an intimate evening and then getting together later on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Gore said that this time he will try not to be longwinded and condescending. That's what he said. That's right. Yeah, then Gore spent the next 45 minutes explaining what condescending means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday, George W. Bush told reporters that his bedtime is 9:30 PM. That's what he said. Or as George W. puts it, when the little hand's on the nine and the big hand is on the six.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tonight, right after 'The Bette Midler Show,' on CBS comes the Al W. Gore/George W. Bush debates. Talk about a coincidence. Bette Midler and Al Gore have the same make-up person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;It's easy for me to make jokes about the debates because I got nothing to do with them. But these guys take this stuff very seriously. . Al Gore spent a lot of time now working on his fibs and George W. Bush has been practicing his deer in the headlights look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The debate got off to a rocky start. George W. Bush tried to pronounce Slobodan Milosevic and he sprained his tongue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Gore says if he's elected to president, he will put a 24- hour television camera inside the Oval Office. And you thought this show was dull.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore had it out earlier in the second of three debates. . And if you watched the Gore-Bush debate tonight: Wake up, you've fallen asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, I guess you know by now -- another evening of lies. Another evening of deceptions, attacks on character, name-calling, half- truths. But enough about the Clintons' 25th anniversary dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George Bush -- people think he won. He looked pretty good. Although, he did trip up a couple of times. When they asked him about Rwanda, he said, 'Yeah, didn't she play Aunt Esther on 'Sanford and Son?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And what happened to Gore last night? Oh, man. He looked like a Great Dane who just got neutered, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, if you watched this debate, you know the format was a little different than the first one. Remember the first one? They were standing. This one they were sitting. In the next one, they'll be squatting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush came out against gay marriage. He said the only time he wants to see two men holding hands is during a double execution, I believe is what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Gore, a little more liberal. Gore said he thinks you should have some kind of civic union between gay people, a union where two people could be together, even though it's not really a marriage. Kind of like what the Clintons have now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night during the debate, Bush brought up the phrase 'Brownfield.' Do you know what that was? He said a brownfield is an abandoned industrial building sitting idly in some of our urban centers. Out here, we call them Planet Hollywood. Big empty buildings that nobody owns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And it was boring. God, it's boring. Like, Al Gore kept talking about the melting of the polar ice cap. I would rather watch that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;On all the local news shows yesterday, right before the debate, all they were talking about was Al Gore's makeup. Right? I'm not making it up.  They said, 'He's going to lighten it for this time. It was too heavy. He had too much rouge. They're gonna give him a different look.' Meanwhile, the Miss America contestants are working on their speeches for world peace. Isn't that backwards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;But I think we've come a long way as a country. You've gone from George Washington, who could not tell a lie, to Bill Clinton, would who could not tell the truth, to Al Gore, who can't tell the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Don't you wish Clinton was running again? I do, because he would be great. Not only would he kick these guys' butts in the debates, he'd go home and have sex with their wives afterwards. That's a candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In Rockville, Maryland, a 38-year-old former public schoolteacher accused of having sex with one of her 12-year-old students has pled guilty. . There's nothing funny about this. She had sex with one of her students. In fact, Al Gore said the class is so crowded, the kid had to stand during sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Last night, of course, Al Gore and George W. Bush held their second debate. And did you know this? Most polls say that George W. came across better than Gore. Yeah. Yeah, afterwards, Bush even said, 'I done good. I be President now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush was fighting a cold during the presidential debate last night. Fighting a pretty bad cold, yeah. Afterwards, George W. was quoted as saying, 'I haven't sniffed that much since college.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;According to a brand-new study that just came out -- this is true -- having regular, vigorous sex can make you look seven years younger.  Yeah, and in a related story, today is President Clinton's 90th birthday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn: &quot;The second of three scheduled presidential debates between Al Gore and George W. Bush took place last night in North Carolina. The clear winner of the debate, the Yankees, 7-1.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Been a bad week for the stocks. It's been bad. In fact, Revlon way down. Way down. Revlon cosmetics. Well, sure, after the second debate, Al Gore's cut way back on how much makeup -- that's gonna affect sales.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a new MSNBC poll, Bush leading Gore -- 43% to 42%. There is a 3% margin of error, unless Al Gore talks. Then there's a 50% margin of error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush and Gore agreed on so many issues&quot; during the last debate, &quot; now, they're thinking about dumping Cheney and Lieberman, just running together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Well, they differed in on the gay issue. George W. Bush said, 'How one conducts their sex life is their own personal business and nobody else's.' You know Clinton was sitting home going, 'Yo, Bush, my man, yeah! Go with the Bush man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Ever notice the expression on Bush and Gore's face when the other guy is talking. They have that -- you know? They look like the men in the erectile dysfunction ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;102-year-old man here in California -- maybe you saw this guy today on the news -- being called the oldest working man in the country. 102, still working every day. He works in a zipper factory. The sad thing is when Clinton leaves office, he could be laid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Paula Jones posing naked in the December issue of 'Penthouse' magazine. It comes with a medical warning. 'These pictures are Viagra- proof. Don't even try it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;George W. Bush.has invited Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter to join them on the campaign. That's the latest news. That's what he did. That's right. Yeah, George W. Bush was overheard telling her, 'I don't care if you're a lesbian, just as long as you're not gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Earlier today, Al Gore was giving a campaign speech -- and this is true - - a 10-year-old boy fainted and hit his head on the ground. Yeah. He's fine. The kid's fine. But to keep this from happening again, whenever Gore speaks for over five minutes, people will be required to wear seat belts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;In a recent interview, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, our mayor, said that if it were up to him, he would throw all the New York sex shops into the ocean. That was the quote. That's right, and in a related story, President Clinton was spotted buying scuba gear.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess you know we all have a new Miss America. ... Miss Hawaii is the new Miss America. George W. Bush is thrilled. He said, 'About time we had a winner from a foreign country.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;My favorite part of the talent competition. I always enjoy that. Did you see Miss Texas? For her talent, she executed a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Here's some Miss America trivia for you. Did you know the average Miss America contestant spends two hours a day putting on makeup? Two hours. So it's about the same as Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They say this is the closest race in 40 years. They say it could go either way. Like Anne Heche.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I understand both candidates have reached what they call a gentlemen's agreement for tomorrow night's debate. Like if Bush can't remember a fact or detail, Al Gore will make one up for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In their first debate, Al Gore was criticized for being too pushy. Yes, too pushy -- all that. Then the last debate, he's criticized for being too passive. Tomorrow's debate, Gore is going to try to be himself. In fact, I understand right now, Gore is meeting with a focus group to tell him who he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore has come under fire the last couple of weeks. He used to be pro-life, now he's pro-choice. He used to be against gun control, now he's for gun control. Remember, he said he invented the Internet. Well, of course, he didn't invent the Internet. When they say, 'To win, Al Gore needs to appeal to the undecided voter,' but it sounds to me like Al Gore is the undecided voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;George W. Bush is not much better. Like, political experts say that a lot of voters are worried Bush is not up to handling something as complex as this Middle East crisis. Today Bush answered the charges. He said, 'It's time for the Jews and Muslims to stop fighting and start acting like good Christians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I don't know how finely tuned George W. Bush is on world events. Like, today, he was out on the campaign trail. Someone asked him about Kosovo, and he said, no, he prefers the Price Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And scary moment at a Ralph Nader speech in New Jersey yesterday -- today it was. A small package exploded in the auditorium while he was giving a speech. Luckily, no one was injured because there was nobody in the auditorium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Some women environmentalists are protesting the cutting down and logging of trees by holding a topless prayer vigil. They're going to be topless on the trail that goes into the woods. . In a related story today, President Clinton cut short his Middle East peace summit to fly home and deal with this crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Tuesday is another presidential debate. First Al Gore was overbearing. That was in the first debate. Then in the second debate, he was completely passive. Now, he's working on being dazed and disoriented.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore has made this promise. He says if he is elected, in the first 100 days, he will nail down a personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I'm no political expert. I'm no political pundit, but it looks to me like you have a clear cut choice. You have the choice of one candidate who babbles incoherently and then a second candidate who babbles incoherently.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, the third presidential debate was held earlier tonight. You know, they say bad things happen in threes. So this should be the last one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I guess tonight's town hall debate will show that the candidates can relate to the concerns of ordinary people. Like, they have to prove these are not just two guys born with silver spoons in their mouths, you know. Although, when Bush talks, it still sounds like he has a spoon in his mouth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They said that George W. Bush got ready for tonight's town hall debate by sitting on a stool answering questions from his aides. He said he really enjoyed doing that because it reminded him of being back in high school. Except, this time the stool wasn't in the corner, and he didn't have to wear that big hat with the point on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to a survey by Marie Claire magazine, 62% of women say they'd rather kiss Al Gore than George W. Bush. Well, sure. After they kiss Al Gore, then they can sit down discuss makeup tips with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, is making headlines again in the campaign. Don't confuse this with Boris Yeltsin's book, Make the Earth Stop Spinning so Fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;As you know, President Clinton is on his way back from Egypt. He's there working on a ceasefire in the Mideast. We call it a ceasefire. They call it reloading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The German intelligence agency is reporting that former Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic was involved in drug trafficking, and today, George W. Bush said, 'You know, I thought I saw that guy somewhere before.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Everybody in New York city has the subway series fever. For example, Mayor Giuliani's wife is wearing a Mets cap. His girlfriend is wearing a Yankees cap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Here's the problem with that Al Gore. Al Gore now has a split personality. Whenever he turns on his personality, everybody splits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George Bush, if you saw that debate earlier tonight, man, is this guy confident. He was so confident, he kissed Tipper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;The first debate, they said Al Gore was too aggressive. And then they said the second debate, he was too passive, but for the third debate, earlier tonight, they got the medication just right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush is saying he wants to look for oil in wilderness areas. He wants to go prospecting for oil in wilderness areas. And I think, well, the only good thing about this is for a change we'll have a president who is drilling in Alaska instead of the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Looks like we got ourselves a Subway Series. . Don't confuse that with the presidential debates, that was a 'Sub-par Series.' That's a whole different thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Folks, I'm going to try and do the monologue quickly tonight before Al Gore interrupts me.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Now, if you watched the debates, you saw they did it in a different format. Like, in the first debate, both candidates spent the entire 90 minutes standing. Then the second debate, they spent the entire 90 minutes sitting. And last night's debate, they spent the entire 90 minutes lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;They call it the presidential town hall debates. Shut up! Huh? It didn't take place in a town hall. It wasn't really a debate, and neither of those guys is presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, this is kind of like an election for class president, isn't it? I mean, you got Bush, the dumb jock. You got Gore, the annoying nerd. And all the cheerleaders are wishing Clinton would run again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore kept accusing Bush of favoring the wealthiest 1% of Americans. Hey, you know what Al Gore and Bush call the wealthiest 1% of Americans? Daddy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'm watching on MSNBC, they have debate psychologists. That's their job to analyze these things. They say that Gore kept invading George W. Bush's space. He said he kept walking up to him because he wanted to establish that he is the alpha male. Although, I thought when he lifted up his leg to mark his territory, that seemed a little over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, Gore may be in trouble. They say his campaign may be facing a critical shortage. After these three debates, they now think there might not be enough makeup left for Halloween.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, you know what else bothered me? Bush kept talking about how great his health care plan is. Yet, he still has that annoying sniffle. What, has he had that cold for a year now? What the hell kind of health care plan is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Oh, I guess the high point of the debate was when Gore said Bush was tied to the rich and powerful. Then Bush called Gore a big spender. You know, nothing like two millionaires fighting over who will best protect the middle class, you know what I'm saying? It's like watching Woody Allen and Michael Douglas fighting over who's better to baby-sit your 16-year- old daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;According to the current issue of Marie Claire magazine, 62% of women say they would rather kiss Al Gore than George W. Bush. Let me tell you something. If you do kiss these guys, remember, you're not just kissing a politician. You're also kissing the butt of everyone they've kissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I keep hearing the pundits on these shows, they say the debates we had are like a job interview for the candidates, and we're personnel during the hiring. If that's true, need to put another want ad in the paper. We need to see more people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Right now it's like 44%-44%, something like that. It's a cliffhanger. I mean, one guy you want to throw off a cliff, the other guy you want to hang.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I'll tell you something -- I'll tell you -- the gloves were off the other night. The debates got pretty heated. Like, Vice President Gore said about Bush, 'If you want someone that will support the big drug companies, this is your man.' And he pointed right at Bush. Bush defended himself very well. He said, 'I'm not a tool of big drug companies. In fact, I have personally supported the small independent crack dealers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;One man wanted to know why Governor Bush didn't intervene more often during the executions in Texas. And Bush had a pretty good answer. He said, 'It's because they wait until midnight to call me. Who hasn't heard the phone ring in the middle of the night and felt like killing somebody?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Bush is continuing to campaign around the country, telling everyone about his tough education standards in Texas. Under his plan, every sixth-grader will read at a third-grade level by the time they're in the ninth grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Al Gore's on the current issue of Rolling Stone. They are saying the picture had to be retouched. Because his crotch area looked a little too bulgy. Did you hear that? . Now, I know Gore has been prone to exaggeration, but you don't think he's putting a tube sock down there, do you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;I love the way the politicians try to spin things. Like today, the Gore campaign said yes, they did admit the Vice President was aroused. But he was thinking of the American people at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Actually, this is not the first time that Rolling Stone has had to airbrush a photo in the crotch area because it appeared that a political figure was aroused. It happened a couple of years ago with Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Anybody see Good Morning America today? This was kind of interesting. Barbara Bush was on. She said during the debate, she was worried that Al Gore was going to hit George. Remember, he walked right up to him -- she thought he was going to hit him. And what better way for Bush to prove he is his own man than have your mom stick up for you like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And Al Gore's running mate, Joe Lieberman, was on Regis. Gore's on Rosie. Remember when they used to do Meet the Press?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;You know, Lieberman is still keeping his name on the ballot for the Senate race in Connecticut, in case this whole thing doesn't work out for Gore. How embarrassing is that for Gore? Three weeks before the election, your running mate is still undecided. I guess he wants to hear more from both the candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;How's this for irony -- the head of Immigration and Naturalization Service has resigned. She's moving to Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;A man by the name of Mike Krout -- he's one of the top officials for a conservative Christian group, Focus on the Family -- has resigned because he has an extramarital affair. Apparently he was focusing on the wrong family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;PETA, you know, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, branching out into other areas. They say they want to look at the cruel and unusual practice of testing cosmetics on Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Al Gore wants the debates rerun on cable to make sure as many people as possie can experience his off-putting personality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;George W. Bush, by the way, is on the program tonight. We have an exciting deal. Everybody in the audience will receive a dollar bill tonight every time the Governor says, 'I trust people, not government.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;I think the Governor should feel right at home. He's used to spending time with people with heart trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;(Bush) said he was actually nervous during the debates because if you saw the debate, Al Gore got very close to George W. Bush and just kind of, you know, it was kind a tense moment. And the Governor said he was nervous, he thought Al was going to kiss him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush (appearing on the Letterman show): &quot;Top Ten Changes I Will Make In The White House (read by George W. Bush): 10.To save taxpayer dollars, calls to winning sports teams will be collect. 9. New rule at Cabinet meetings: You can't talk until you ride the mechanical bull. 8. Goodbye boring presidential radio address, hello Dick Cheney spins the hits of the'80s, '90s and today. 7. Make sure the White House library has lots of books with big print and pictures. 6. Just for fun, issue an executive order commanding my brother Jeb to wash my car. 5. First day in office, my mother's face goes up on Mount Rushmore. 4. Looking into hiring a security guard for our nuclear secrets. 3. Will not get sick on Japanese leaders like other President Bushes I know. 2. Give Oval Office one heck of a scrubbing. 1. Tax relief for all Americans except smart-aleck talk-show hosts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Last night, on the news here in LA, they showed the winner of the pumpkin-growing contest. You see that on the news? A guy grew a pumpkin weighing 800 pounds. Isn't that unbelievable? What are you going to carve out of an 800-pound pumpkin? Okay, besides Ted Kennedy's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;The big story is Al Gore on erection -- election day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;This is like a huge story. They're claiming that the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone had to be retouched -- because Al Gore's on the cover -- because it looks like -- how can I say this? He's standing like this. In the photo, it looks like he is aroused. So they had to retouch it. Well, you know what happened? He was aroused. Apparently, he had just met with five Chinese campaign contributors and was so excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;In fact, his running mate, Joe Lieberman saw the cover and told Gore, 'I know a rabbi that can take care of that for you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;See, that's the difference between Gore and Clinton. See, Gore gets airbrushed in the photo, Clinton gets airbrushed in person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Did you hear about this? Clinton, I guess, started campaigning for Gore. And he's recording telephone messages that will be automatically dialed to households across the country, asking for people to vote for Gore. Here's a copy. Here it is, take a look.&quot; (President Clinton): &quot;This is President William Jefferson Clinton, and I encourage you to vote for Vice President Al Gore come this election day.&quot; Leno: &quot;See, that's -- that's if a man answers. Okay, now, can we play the other one? Apparently, if a woman answers, you hear: - 'Oh, hey, baby. What you wearing? Wanna play a little bit of &quot;Who's your daddy? Would you like to see the Presidential staff?&quot;'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;And in an interview with the gay magazine, The Advocate -- I believe Clinton is the only President ever to do an interview like this with a gay magazine -- Clinton says that gay men stood by him during his impeachment because they identify with his experience. Well, sure. Trying to have sex with Paula Jones, that's about as close to being gay as a straight guy could get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Sodomy Bill, wasn't that Clinton's Secret Service code name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: &quot;Today is the birthday of baseball hall of famer Whitey Ford. That's a nickname sort of gone out of style, huh? Don't meet many guys named 'Whitey' anymore. Except, of course, that guy running for president, 'Whitey' Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani held a joint pep rally for both Yankee and Met fans. Isn't that nice? He brought them all together, so it was very nice. That's right, yeah. The official death toll will be released tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;I don't know if you heard the latest, this was really weird -- Al Gore, the Vice President, appears on the cover of this month's Rolling Stone magazine. And it's been a big controversy. It's been reported -- this is true -- that they had to air brush his crotch region because it looked like he had an erection. That's true. True story. Yeah, yeah, Gore says it's all part of his promise to work hard for the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Yesterday on Live with Regis, Al Gore, I guess because he grew up on a farm or something, showed Regis Philbin how to hypnotize a chicken. That's right. Yeah, yeah, and today, George W. Bush says Regis has to electrocute a chicken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: &quot;Everybody's been saying, why isn't President Clinton campaigning for Al Gore? Everyone's wondering. Well, Al Gore announced today that President Clinton is going to start -- from this moment, he's gonna start campaigning for him. Big news. However, to calm voters, Gore said, 'Don't worry, I'm going to put his penis in a lock box.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;God bless that Hillary Clinton. She's still kind of an outsider, you know? But you know, she tries. People are saying, 'Hillary, it's the subway series, who are you rooting for in the subway series?' And she said, 'The D train?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: &quot;Hillary Clinton is doing everything she can to exploit the subway series. She's dating David Justice, did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
