<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US forces have taken Fallujah. Experts say it's going to be hard to keep Iraq's insurgents from going after people in other cities. That will be hard. We can't even keep the Indiana Pacers from going after people.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech at the big summit in Chile, President Bush said he will work hard to have a major guest worker program with Mexico. He says this way we can fill the empty jobs here that nobody wants. Like in his Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met today with the president of Colombia. Bush told the President of Colombia Bobby and Whitney send their best. And the President gave Bush a package for Bobby and Whitney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now talk in political circles of amending the United States Constitution so Arnold Schwarzenegger could be president. The Democrats are against it. First, they want the Constitution changed so maybe a Democrat could be president again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Clinton Presidential Library was opened last Thursday. Today, the city council of Little Rock voted to shut it down. Did you hear about this? Yeah, turns out the area is not zoned for adult businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks saw the big melee between the Pacers and Pistons? It was crazy, there was screaming, there was shoving, there was rioting. I'm telling you, it was just like being at Arafat's funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those White House resignations - crazy, isn't it? Colin Powell and everybody else taking a hike. And Tom Ridge, Homeland Security. How are we going to fill those shoes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another White House resignation earlier today. Laura Bush! That's right, Laura Bush is stepping down. She's going to be replaced by Mary Tyler Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran supposedly is working on a nuclear missile. That's chilling. The good news is, however, they have to drop it from a camel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Oh, man, what a crowd. You sound like President Bush when he heard Dan Rather was stepping down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather announced today he's leaving as the anchor of CBS News. Rather said he's not been able to verify it yet, so it's not official.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he uses all those Texas expressions. See, I don't -- like what'd he say? He'd said he'd leave when the kettle starts whistling with the frying pan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I sensed he was going to leave. Did you feel that? Anybody see the news last night, CBS News? When he signed off, he said, 'I'm Dan Rather, and you can all bite me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rather is &quot;not leaving show business. I think he's got lot of offers. He may go over and host the 'Ripley's Believe It Or Not.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather said today that he looks forward to working as an investigative reporter full-time. See, that's how that whole forged document story happened. He's only working part-time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, he's been there 24 years, longer than any other news anchor. Including Walter Cronkite. Walter Cronkite was only there 19 years. 24 years. When he started at CBS News, Andy Rooney's eyebrows were only a foot long, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of changes at the top. First Tom Brokaw. He's leaving next week. Tom Brokaw's leaving on the 2nd, he's gone. Dan Rather's gone. Today at ABC, they're asking Peter Jennings, 'Hey, how's that 401(k) of yours? Pretty good? You like golf, do you? You enjoy swimming?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Detroit have identified the man who threw the cup of beer on&quot; Indiana Pacer Ron Artest. &quot;You know, the guy who threw the beer? Today they got him. You know what's really scary about this guy? Police went to his house. They found a stockpile of 300 cups and beer making material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The penalty phase of the Scott Peterson trial has now been delayed till after Thanksgiving. You know us Americans, we like to fatten 'em up before we kill 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if he does get the death penalty, some inmates on California's death row have been there 30 years. They've been able to put off death for 30 years. Today, Dick Cheney said, 'Hey, I'll take that deal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After pressure from the United States, it looks like 80% of Iraq's debt will be forgiven by creditors. 80%. And our latest story, today Donald Trump said to Bush, 'Hey, could you invade my casino?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD just broke up a mob-operated limousine company. The mob was controlling a limousine company. And I was thinking, I think I rode with them once from the airport...I had to ride in the trunk all the way back in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But remember, this is New York City. You don't have to take a mob- owned limousine. You can take an Al Qaeda-owned cab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is back from his trip to Colombia. I thought it was very nice. He brought back a poncho for Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush has a big problem now, and don't kid yourself. It turns out he ignored an intelligence memo about the Indiana Pacers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather, beloved CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, announced he is stepping down as anchorman of the CBS News in March. The good news is he will be replaced by Conan O'Brien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today in Washington, Vice President Cheney's wife, Lynn, lit the star on top of the national Christmas tree. ... There was an awkward moment when Cheney said, 'If you have any trouble with the electrical work, my daughter is a lesbian.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Dick Cheney?s wife, Lynne Cheney, placed the star on top of the national Christmas tree this week, outside the White House. Mrs. Cheney was accompanied by her three granddaughters, who she announced are all heterosexual.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Their lesbian daughter was also there. In fact, she was one of the lumberjacks who cut down the tree.?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?There is all kind of speculation about who is going to replace Dan Rather. Some say CBS will surprise everyone and go with a middle- aged white guy.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: ?Dan Rather, anchor of CBS News, is leaving. And the rumor is, he'll be replaced with someone CBS feels is more objective, the former Iraqi information minister.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: ?Kind of an embarrassing incident at the Clinton library yesterday. You hear about this? Anybody tell you about this? Two girls wandered into the Clinton library, went to lost and found looking for their virginity.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Oh, here you go -- I'm sure you heard about this. The Republicans have won yet another seat. Dan Rather's.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?In fact, when Dan Rather announced he was leaving, President Bush said, ?I didn't even know he was in my Cabinet.??</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Dan Rather said that stepping down was the hardest thing he's ever had to announce in his career. Actually, it was the second hardest. The hardest thing is when he had to announce Bush being re-elected.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Dan Rather said today, his decision to retire has nothing to do with the controversy over those fake National Guard documents. That's kind of like Yasser Arafat saying this isn't a step down. It had nothing to do with him dying.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush ?said he's very sorry to hear that Dan Rather is leaving. And he said, ?By the way, Dan, the National Guard documents? They were real!??</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Tom Brokaw is leaving. Dan Rather is leaving. You realize the most trusted guy in television news will wind up being Geraldo Riviera now.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush ?was at that meeting of the leaders of the Pacific Rim nations?.anyway, he pledged to Mexican President Vicente Fox that he hopes to ease immigration rules. That's what he said. I don't know, did we have immigration rules with Mexico??</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?How many of you folks saw the big Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade? ? Each giant balloon, each of those giant balloons that you see, takes 54 men to control it with big cables tethering the balloon. It's the same team that gets Michael Moore into his pants.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Dan Rather, the anchor man of the CBS Evening News, is retiring in March. He's been in the job 24 years, Dan Rather is stepping down. Long wonderful career. So it's official now, I'm the weirdest guy on CBS.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Your Governor Pataki, George Pataki, they're saying he may become the next director of Homeland Security. Yeah. Right now he's home memorizing the color chart.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?President Bush has ordered an increase of 50% in spies and terror analysts at the CIA. He's increasing that activity. Apparently he hasn't been getting enough intelligence memos to ignore.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O?Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?This is weird. It was -- true story -- reported today that a 72-year-old great-grandmother, who works for the Defense Department, has been sent to Iraq. They sent a 72-year-old great-grandmother to Iraq. When asked about it, the 72-year-old said, ?It's been quite a while since I've been to Mesopotamia.??</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder what could have happened to them. I hope, wherever they are, they had a good Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, of course, is also the busiest travel weekend of the year. In fact, the lines were so long at the airport and the security so overworked at LAX, they were asking passengers just to feel each other up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of the CIA's top undercover agents, whose names have been withheld, resigned today. Okay. How do we know that? They're undercover and we don't know who they are, but they quit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ukrainian officials now have declared a winner in their presidential elections, but now the European Union says, no, the results are illegitimate. The give-away was when the new president, Victor Yanukovych, thanked his brother, Jeb Yanukovych.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a late breaking bulletin from the Bush White House. The White House Christmas tree has submitted its resignation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush called on all Americans to do volunteer work, for example, National Guard service.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on at the White House, or as President Bush calls it, 'Home Alone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another Cabinet member resigned today. Tom Ridge, Director of Homeland Security, he resigned today. When they asked him how he was feeling, he said he was a little red-faced, then a little blue, but he's gonna upgrade to yellow later in the day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush visiting Canada. Since he took office in 2001, this is his first official visit to Canada. The President apologized for taking so long, but he said this will complete his goal of visiting all 50 states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, President Bush was going to go to Canada back in '68, but then his dad got him in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Relations between the US and Canada have been a little rocky since we invaded Iraq. And Bush is hoping to smooth this out. Like, today, he offered to stop calling Canadian Bacon 'Freedom Bacon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think President Bush knows a lot about Canada. Like, today, I don't think he helped the situation when he asked to meet with their leader, Wayne Gretzky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when President Bush's parents heard he was going to Canada, they said, 'Hey, could you pick us up some cheap prescription drugs when you're up there?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek magazine reported that CBS News might be going after Matt Lauer to take over for Dan Rather. And the word is, they've been able to offer Lauer something NBC has not been able to do -- a decent haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather told the Hollywood Reporter today in an interview that he talks to Ed Murrow's ghost. You know, Edward R. Murrow, the famous reporter? He talks to his ghost. He said he's seen the ghost in the building late at night and has talked to him many times. You know, I liked it better when Dan wasn't naming his sources, remember?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Michigan dog has been nursing two stray kittens. Did you see that footage? It was kind of cool, a dog nursing the two kittens. And, today, President Bush said he's working on an amendment to ban this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, this just in, I heard it before I came out here. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has resigned. Yep. He's being replaced by Conan O'Brien.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is up in Canada. He's up there to mend US-Canadian relations, and he's also going to pick up some discount Lipitor for Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have the big White House Christmas tree. It's beautiful, quite a sight, big, huge, 20-foot tree. They have 200 glass balls on the tree, 75 tinsel garlands, 50 letters of resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced that his nominee for Commerce Secretary is a former CEO at Kellogg's. Yeah. Afterwards, the President admitted, 'Maybe I shouldn't nominate people on an empty stomach.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

He holds a press conference to basically say he made announcement that he had no announcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh boy, horrible news today for Barry Bonds. This is unbelievable. It seems last night his steroid cream got mixed up with his hemorrhoid cream, and now they're huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you what's a hot Christmas gift this year for kids. Chemistry sets. Chemistry sets. Especially if your kid wants to play Major League Baseball. This is perfect 'cause he can just make his own steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the crew aboard the International Space Station is so low on food right now they've been told by NASA to reduce their calorie intake until a Russian supply ship arrives in two weeks. Isn't that unbelievable? They're out of food. Well, they're not really out of food. They have a bunch of those Lean Cuisine frozen entrees on board. They're just not that desperate yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adam Sandler has a terrific movie out called 'Spanglish,' where he hires a housekeeper who can't speak English, and this causes a lot of problems. No, that's Bernard Kerik, the Homeland Security guy. I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernard Kerik, has withdrawn his name. He said it's because of nanny problems. The New York Daily News says, 'No, no.' They say Kerik cheated on his wife, and he also cheated on his mistress with another woman. So now Bush thinks secretly he may be a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One political expert on one of the cable shows says that the White House nomination of Bernard Kerik as Homeland Security chief, they said it was rushed, not fully thought out, and they didn't have a backup plan if things go wrong. That doesn't sound like the White House I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerik said he withdrew because questions arose about a former nanny's immigration status. He had no idea she was illegal. Today, Kerik was offered a job as security chief at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced that his choice for Energy Secretary is a guy named Samuel Bodman. Have you seen this guy? Show his picture. Didn't he used to be on the 'I Love Lucy' show?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorists may try to use laser beams, like a laser pointer...to blind pilots and bring down jets. ... They say it's almost impossible to defend against this. Unless, of course, the pilots have a pair of sunglasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're here on a special night. The entire balcony in the Ed Sullivan Theatre is filled with skeletons from Bernard Kerik's closet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the busiest mailing day of the year, the Post Office will handle 85 million pieces of mail. That's right. They'll handle them, they won't mail them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An apartment building on Fifth Avenue is getting rid of its red tailed hawk. Turns out he had an illegal nanny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has announced that our new Energy Secretary will be Sam Bodman. Yeah. Gee, I hope he can fill the charisma void left by Spencer Abraham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are going very well for President Bush. He had his annual checkup and he passed his physical, no word yet on his mental.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One year ago today they pulled&quot; Saddam Hussein &quot;out of a hole and they found him with bags of cash, he had a pistol, and several unopened packages of underwear. It's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctors told President Bush his health was 'A-Okay.' That's what the doctors said, 'A-Okay.' Bush told them, flat out, 'Look, don't give me all that medical jargon. Give it to me in language I can understand.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know the Army gives free breast implants to our female soldiers? ... Isn't that amazing? We don't have enough body armor to go around to protect our people. But we're giving free breast implants. You know what I say? Make the breast implants out of Kevlar.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the sixth year anniversary of President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Six years ago this week, he was impeached. I think we all remember where we were when we heard that Bill Clinton was being impeached. I know he probably remembers where he was when he heard he was being impeached. He was at his desk in the Oval Office having sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Bernard Kerik withdrew his nomination to become secretary of Homeland Security, it's been revealed that Kerik had a secret marriage, two mistresses, and worked for a mafia-related company.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today is Wednesday, or as Bernard Kerik calls it, Hump Day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernard Kerik said he's sorry he will not be able to be head of Homeland Security. He said, with a wife and two mistresses, he just doesn't have the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's choice for Homeland Security director, Bernard Kerik, has stepped down because they said he hired a nanny that may have been an illegal alien, had a number of mistresses and may have had mob ties. Well, that makes you feel secure, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't even do a background check on the guy who's supposed to be in charge of background checks.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One reason Bernard Kerik's nomination looked good is because Democrats like Hillary Clinton praised him. Hillary thought he would be a good choice. Well, that's unusual, don't you think? Hillary looking the other way when the guy's been fooling with his wife?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a complete physical over the weekend. At one point, the doctor told him to take care of his colon. And Bush said, 'No, no, he resigned.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former CIA Director, George Tenet. Remember George Tenet? Remember the country went to war based on his absolute guarantee that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? It's a slam dunk. Of course, it turned out his information was completely wrong. And today, Dan Rather said, 'Hey, where's my medal?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of President Bush's daughters, Jenna, you know the blonde one? She's going to teach at a public school in Washington, DC. She's probably going to teach English. And in a related story, Dick Cheney's daughter is going to be teaching phys ed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report just out today, our nation's public health system is not ready for a bioterror scare. We're not ready for bioterror. We're not even ready for the flu, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US trade deficit has grown 9% in October to a record $55.5 billion. In fact, you know the only product this country uses that's still made in America -- anybody know what it is? Steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While steroids can make a man's muscles increase -- do you know this? They also make his testicles shrink. That's what doctors say -- steroids make your testicles shrink. Which is pretty disappointing if you're a baseball player. In uniform, you look like you're in the majors, you take off the uniform, you look like you're in the little leagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cold today in New York City, am I right about that? Oh, lousy. Here's how cold it is today. Both of the Bush twins switched from Margaritas to Irish coffee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I get these, instead of Christmas cards, you get like memos from cousins and family members and friends, like I got one today, it was like a 40-page memo, and it's an update about what the, you know, like you care. So I'm reading it and it starts off like this, it says, 'Well, it's been an up and down year for the Kerik family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, turns out he had three wives. Three wives. Had two mistresses and several girlfriends. And every cent he earned went for Viagra.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks remember Chemical Ali? The Iraqi official, well, they've got him and he's going to be standing trial. And it does not look good for Chemical Ali, he does not have a very convincing alibi. He says he was out fishing with Scott Peterson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukrainian presidential candidate Victor Yushchenko &quot;was poisoned. He's fine now, but have you seen him? He just looks weird, he just very unnatural, his face is disfigured, it's also discolored...no, that's Michael Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, true story, former President Clinton was walking in Central Park when someone started shouting at him.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Senator John McCain says he's worried that steroid abuse in professional sports will spill over into the fans using them. But isn't that a good thing? I mean, don't we want our fans on steroids? I mean, this way, when the athletes go into the stands to beat the hell out of them, they can defend themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is good news for Major League Baseball. This year, attendance grew 5%. The bad news, Barry Bonds grew 30%.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Daily News, the White House has 41 Christmas trees up this season. 41 trees. One for each of the red states. That's what they did.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm not sure if President Bush has a full grasp of this issue. Like, he was asked today if he had any plans to make the US dollar stronger. And he said, 'We're thinking of making it two-ply.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ukrainian presidential candidate, Victor Yushchenko &quot;was poisoned.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government says next week, 'Chemical Ali' will be the first of Saddam Hussein's lieutenants to be put on trial.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says that moving to the United States can make you obese. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What an ugly audience we had last night. Half way through the show, they tried to get me to drink Ukrainian soup.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Bernie Kerik? ... Man alive, I think he would have made a great Homeland Security director. He had three wives and two mistresses. I mean, he's used to fighting terrorism, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bernard Kerik, with all his trouble, he too is in the holiday spirit. Earlier tonight he went carolling, then he went 'Michelleing,' then he went 'Nancying.' Then finally he went 'Racheling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Apprentice' is really more than a reality show.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doctors now say steroids make men's testicles shrink. And today, Barry Bonds says, '[in a falsetto voice] That's ridiculous. I've never heard anything like that in my life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the holidays, Paris Hilton has a brand-new perfume with a secret ingredient. Secret ingredient. Now coincidentally, Barry Bonds, San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds, also has cologne for the holidays with a secret ingredient. But he swears he has no idea what is in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, President Bush had his annual checkup, you know and he passed the physical with flying colors. No word yet on the mental part of the test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the one thing, his body fat is up 18%. So he is starting to balloon a little bit and to give you an idea how heavy that is, if he was a woman, Bill Clinton would hit on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;140 US soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan got front-row seats over the weekend to a Dallas Mavericks game. And a related story -- a bunch of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay were forced to get front row seats to the New Orleans Hornets game.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden, as you know, released another audio recording. His usual stuff -- he called for death to Americans. He called for the destruction of all Western culture, except for 'Desperate Housewives.' He said, 'I love that show.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Bush named Time magazine's 'Person of the Year.' That came out today. Of course, when he heard the news, he was stunned. Bush said, 'I don't even subscribe to Time magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I still don't think Bush quite gets it. Like, today, he kept asking people, 'So, where's Ed McMahon with my big check?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got 'Person of the Year.' And a related story, Senator John Kerry was given a free copy of 'Entertainment Weekly.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a big interview in next week's People magazine, President Bush said he prays every day, but he does not ask others around him to join in. You know, kind of like the way he went to war in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's the latest on Social Security. Looks like Donald Rumsfeld is about to start collecting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican Senator Chuck Hagel now says he has no confidence in Donald Rumsfeld. He says he thinks things are worse in Iraq than they have ever been. But other senators are saying, even though Rumsfeld has made serious mistakes, it would be disruptive to replace him right now. See, only in government jobs does that kind of thing happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nowhere else in the real world -- if they go, 'Johnson, you screwed up. The company has lost a fortune. All right, carry on. Just keep doing what you're doing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big question is, who will be the next Homeland Security chief? You know, President Bush's nominee, Bernard Kerik -- you've heard about that guy -- he had to withdraw the name because questions arose over a former nanny's immigration status. Apparently, she was working here illegally. And today, Wal-Mart said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico has launched a million-dollar ad campaign to encourage Mexicans to come back home for vacation. And I love their slogan, 'The hole in the fence goes both ways.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They made George Bush 'Person of the Year,' but I was on the list. I was right between Bernard Kerik and Chemical Ali. Very close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so cold, Bernard Kerik was glad to be in hot water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Washington, President Bush outlined his second term agenda. Here's what it is, Fridays off and ladies drink free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I received a Christmas card from Donald Rumsfeld. Would have been nice if he actually signed it. But, you know, the rubber stamp was a nice touch, I thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the Republican senators, now they've turned against Rumsfeld, they want Rumsfeld to resign. So here's what Rumsfeld did. He found out who was behind this movement and he's stripping these Senators and running them around on a leash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the White House -- this is true -- so far this year, President Bush has logged over 100,000 miles on Air Force One. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, even more impressive, President Bush has logged over 200,000 hours on 'PlayStation 2.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, there's snow everywhere. In fact, New York City, it was five below Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold in New York, Bernard Kerik got into bed with his own wife. That's how cold.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time magazine has named President Bush the 'Person of the Year.' ... Quite an honor. Although I'm not sure Bush understands it. Like he said today, he can't decide if he wants the free travel alarm clock or the tote bag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Moore was also being considered for Time's Person of the Year. Unfortunately, he couldn't fit on the cover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Americans are worried now. They say they can't rely on Social Security anymore. And you know something? They're right. They're right. Let me tell you something. If you want the government to pay for your housing, food and medical bills until you're 80 or 90 years old, you're just gonna have to kill somebody and go live on death row, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nearly 75% of older Americans say they're in favor of legalizing medical marijuana. You thought grandma's house smelled funny before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the busiest mailing day of the season. I went to the Post Office and it was crazy. People were shoving, people were pushing, people were fighting. It was like Arafat's funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news for Bernard Kerik. Today he was officially placed on Santa's naughty list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're running low on food on the International Space Station. Isn't that amazing? They asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about this. He said, 'Well, you go with the food you got, not with the food you want.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More trouble for this Donald Rumsfeld. His auto pen malfunctioned and began signing the name 'Lemony Snicket.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But today, President Bush said that he was standing by Rumsfeld. And you know what that means, he'll be gone in a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush began making Federal cuts in the government budget, big, big cuts. I thought this was a good idea. To help out, the Bush twins are switching to Riteaid Vodka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush was chosen as 'Person of the Year' by Time magazine. Not only that, Martha Stewart was chosen as 'Person of the Year' by 'Doing Time' magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's USA Today features an editorial by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defending the war in Iraq. And you can tell it was written by Rumsfeld because the opening line of the editorial is, 'Shut your pie hole and listen!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christmas shopping a lot easier this year for President Bush. We have fewer and fewer allies we have to buy gifts for. Just get England a little something, then we're fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sent Donald Rumsfeld a Christmas present today. A pen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not looking good for Donald Rumsfeld. First Sen. John McCain said he has no confidence in him. And now Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf said he is angry at Rumsfeld for not providing soldiers in Iraq with the proper armor. In fact, Rumsfeld has screwed up so badly, President Bush may have to give him one of those 'Medal of Freedom' awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest Gallup poll, a majority of Americans want Rumsfeld to step down. And today, Regis said, 'I'll fill in. I'll do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rudy Giuliani announced that Bernard Kerik - remember the guy who was going to be the Homeland Security guy until all the scandal started? Well, he has resigned from his position as Giuliani's partner. Seems Kerik wants to spend more time with his loved ones, and then, if he gets the chance, with his wife and kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nearly 70% of older Americans are in favor of legalizing medical marijuana. You thought Grandpa used to forget stuff before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Clintons, you remember President Clinton and Hillary? Yeah, they're celebrating Christmas up there in Chappaqua, and it's the same every year. Here's what happens, Hillary comes downstairs Christmas morning and finds a surprise under Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of Arkansas has bought the house where former President Clinton and Hillary lived in the 1970s and plans to turn it into a museum. The University also plans to buy the dog house where Clinton spent most of the '90s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
