<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Jimmy Carter has called the Bush Administration the worst in history, especially for those who don't remember 20% mortgage rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Jimmy Carter's group, Habitat for Humanity -- you know, he builds those houses for the poor -- today President Bush lashed back at Jimmy Carter. He said, 'Hey, if it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be that many poor people for you to build houses for. Just remember that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you probably know, President Bush was caught driving his truck without a seat belt the other day at the ranch. That's not even the dangerous part. The dangerous part -- Dick Cheney was riding shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Daily News', presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani has been paying his wife $10,000 a month to help write his speeches. Well, that's every wife's dream, huh? Put words in your husband's mouth and get paid for it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a related story, President Bush gives his wife, Laura, $5,000 a month to teach him how to pronounce some of the bigger words in his speeches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, an embarrassing moment at the Cannes Film Festival. ... I guess Michael Moore is at the Cannes Film Festival. He walks in to promote his new movie 'Sicko.' People started yelling, 'Shrek!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the show tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Listen to this -- and I'm very happy. I checked today, and under the new immigration bill, we can keep Arnold as our Governor. So we are...safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. Our good friend Tom Arnold has filed for divorce after five years of marriage to his third wife. Yeah, yeah. You know what that means? He could run as a Republican for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey's ex-wife says that when she found out her husband was gay she went to Hillary Clinton for advice. Yeah, Hillary said, 'Gay? I wish I had your problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraqi President Jalal Talabani has come to the United States and checked into a weight loss clinic, because he's dangerously obese. Yes, I'm not kidding about that. ... A spokesperson for the clinic said, 'You can't blame the leader of Iraq for eating every meal like it's his last.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, an embarrassing moment for President Bush today. Did you see that? At the press conference, somebody stood up and said, 'The American people don't believe you on the war.' Did you see this? They told the President, 'You've lost all your credibility, you completely screwed things up.' And then Bush said, 'Ma, geez!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, still a lot of -- I don't know if you noticed, there's still a lot of animosity between Jimmy Carter and President Bush. As you know, Jimmy Carter called the Bush Administration the 'worst in history.' And today, President Bush, he did not take it lightly. He lashed back. In fact, he told Jimmy Carter flat-out, he said, 'Hey, you shouldn't be allowed to criticize until you've been president.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Republican presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani. He celebrated a wedding anniversary today. He also has another one tomorrow and two on Monday if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's starting to get nasty out there on the campaign trail. A new book out by veteran Democratic strategist Robert Schrum claims that when asked about gay rights, John Edwards said he was not comfortable around those people. Now do you believe that? Come on. How does a guy who spends 400 bucks to get his hair styled not like gay people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And an 8-year-old girl in Ottawa, Illinois, opened up her McDonald's Happy Meal, found a bag of marijuana, a lighter and pipe in it. Yeah. Turns out it was just the Keith Richards action figure from the 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, experts say, this Memorial Day weekend is expected to go to the pirates. That's when they say. Not 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' pirates of the Persian Gulf, Exxon, Mobile, Shell, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Congress just passed a a law against gas station price gouging. You know how you can tell if a gas station is price gouging? Anybody know? If the sign says, 'Open.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Wall Street Journal, the third largest company for daily oil production is in Mexico. See, this is how we break this immigration deadlock. Listen to me. Make everyone sneaking across the border carry just one barrel of oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the Federal Government arrested 100 illegal immigrants who were working at a poultry plant in Butterfield, Missouri. For some reason, the story didn't mention how many executives there'd been arrested for hiring them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this, opponents of the immigration bill are asking people to call their congressmen and complain. Remember, if you do call, press one for English -- two for Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said in his news conference yesterday, that the United States would leave Iraq if Iraq asked us to. Aren't they shooting at us? Isn't that kind of like a way of saying...?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Iraq has come to America to check into a weight loss clinic. Doesn't this guy have more important things to do than worry about his waistline? See, we're spending billions trying to bring democracy to Iraq. He's sitting in the sauna, in Malibu, drinking a wheatgrass smoothie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine is being criticized for giving a $6 million payout for his former girlfriend, who is a major union boss. Paid her $8,000 a day for every day they had their affair. And you know she's a union boss. Every time they had sex that lasted more than two minutes -- overtime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news from the Memphis zoo. Yaya the panda is pregnant. I don't know if you've been following this story. But Yaya's finally pregnant. Doesn't that sound like a panda that was named by Governor Schwarzenegger, you know? 'Governor, we'd like you to name the panda.' 'Yeah, yeah, I will name the panda...'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend is Memorial Day weekend. And that means it's the beginning of the barbecue season. Because let's face it, those ice caps just aren't melting fast enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This global warming is bad. Our oceans right now are at the same temperature as Yankee stadium beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm dreading this, this weekend my whole family is coming up for the memorial day weekend. And my Uncle Earl is going to be here, do you have a guy like Uncle Earl? ... Last year, Uncle Earl, halfway through the picnic, took me aside and he said, he wanted me to help him buy 150 used FEMA trailers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very weird story from the White House. I don't know if you've heard this. True story. Yesterday, at a press conference in the Rose Garden, President Bush was speaking when a bird pooped on him. That's a true story. Konk! Yeah, and then, apparently, the bird spent the rest of the day high-fiving other birds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter, Mary, and her partner, Heather, had a baby boy. That's very nice. Yeah. Yeah, very nice. Afterwards, Dick Cheney teared up and said, 'I've been asking her to bring a boy home for 30 years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey -- check this out -- Democrats in Washington are going on a lot more dates since they became the majority in Congress. Yeah, since they became the majority, they're going on more dates. Which makes sense, 'cause there's no bigger aphrodisiac than extremely limited legislative power.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had the worst flight this week. ... I'm flying into JFK Airport. I look down. I see them arresting those four terror suspects. You know. And the guy setting next to me had tuberculosis. It was unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about that lawyer from Georgia? A guy named Andrew Speaker, first person in 44 years to be placed under Federal quarantine after he got a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis. He got married and then flew...to Europe. Contracted tuberculosis and then got married. That's when you know you hired the wrong stripper to throw the bachelor party. Okay, right there -- when you wind up with tuberculosis.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that -- a lawyer with tuberculosis. That's two reasons to keep him out of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, his doctors told him he should have stayed in Italy. That's what they said. 'Just stay in Italy,' which, I believe, is also the Republican health care plan. 'Sick? Stay in Italy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the amazing part. Do you know a security guard at the airport actually let the tuberculosis guy come back into the country? Because the guard thought he looked okay. He's on a quarantine list, and the guard said he looked okay. How about that, huh? They find an extra ounce of shampoo in my carry-on bag ? 'Hey! Hey! Hey!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are three new books out this week about Hillary Clinton, one for each of her positions on the Iraq war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani is paying his wife $125,000 a year to help him write his speeches. She's writing his speeches for him, and you can tell. Like, last week, he gave a speech about what awful bitches the first two wives were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, wiped out a whole TV network with one phone call. Got mad. One phone call, the network was gone, off the air. And executives here at NBC were amazed. It's taken them three years to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, how about that thing over the weekend, the authorities busted up that plot, they were going to blow up the pipeline to JFK.&quot; Here &quot;is the scary part. It turned out the guys doing it...were what they call homegrown terrorists. ... And who says President Bush hasn't created new jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is off to Europe for the big...G8 summit. ... And...his approval rating is very low.&quot; Actually, &quot;right now, he's less popular than that tuberculosis guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in the Czech Republic right now. And today, he met with the Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek. Yeah. Or, as Bush likes to call him, 'Hey, Slugger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During last night's Democratic debate, all the candidates said that if they were elected, they would get rid of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy for gay soldiers. ... Yeah, 'don't ask, don't tell' will be replaced by the new policy, 'don't tell me you're wearing those boots with that gun.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight -- big story -- after serving eight years in jail, assisted suicide doctor, Jack Kevorkian, was on 'Larry King Live,'&quot; and &quot;when Kevorkian saw Larry King, he said, 'I swear he was like that when I got here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats had a big debate last night. Hillary Clinton and John Edwards got into a heated argument about foreign policy and then had slap-fight over who has prettier bangs. Of course, Edwards won.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Paris Hilton good a new cellmate today, Scooter Libby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, a Federal judge sentenced Scooter Libby to 30 months in prison for lying. Now, believe me, prison is not the place to be when your nickname is Scooter, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Paris, now Scooter. Not a good month for rich white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Bush is at the big G8 summit in Germany. Many Germans are protesting his visit. See, that's when you know things are bad. When the Germans think you're invading too many countries, that's not good, okay?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney said today the surge policy is working. In fact, gas prices have surged to almost $4 a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And actor and former Senator Fred Thompson, who left the TV show 'Law &amp; Order,' has yet to announce he's running for president. But he's already third in the polls among Republicans. ... Isn't that amazing? He leaves NBC and his ratings automatically go up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize...that if Fred Thompson runs against Hillary Clinton, it will be 'Law &amp; Order' versus 'Cold Case.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are a whole bunch of books out about Hillary Clinton. According to a new biography of Hillary by Carl Bernstein -- now, he's pretty legit -- you know, the Woodward and Bernstein guy? According to his book, Bill Clinton planned to divorce Hillary. Yeah, that's what he said. And when asked why she stayed married, Hillary was quoted as saying, 'There are worse things than infidelity.' To which Bill Clinton said, 'Yeah, fidelity.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a Republican debate tonight,&quot; and &quot;you know what's interesting? They had -- what -- I think there are 1,500 candidates, something like that, running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Democratic debate the other night, the most prominent candidates got the most questions. Like, Obama got 16. Hillary got 15. Edwards got 13.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're saying it's just a matter of time before former senator and 'Law &amp; Order' actor Fred Thompson gets into the Republican race. Apparently, ten rich white guys doesn't offer enough choice to the voters. They need 11 rich white guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So nobody saw the Republican debate last night? Didn't even watch it. There haven't been that many white people on TV since NBC cancelled 'Friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The Boston Herald,' observers are saying that Hillary Clinton looks like she's had 'some work done.' In fact, she has changed her appearance so much in the last year, at one of the campaign rallies, Clinton accidentally hit on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in a forum for Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton said her faith in God got her through her husband's infidelity. She didn't say which one, but it got her through apparently one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said faith and prayers kept her in her marriage. That and her ambition to be senator and then president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And leaders from the eight wealthiest countries in the world gathering in Germany for what they call the G8 summit. See, the G8 was created in 1975 to give Europeans who weren't into soccer something to riot about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I don't think President Bush really understands the G8 thing. He doesn't take it that serious. Every time someone yells out 'G8,' he yells out 'bingo!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Scooter Libby has been sentenced to 30 months in prison, even though he is a good friend of Vice President Dick Cheney. Hey, he got off easy. Cheney's other friend got shot in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a low-level researcher at Yale University has been arrested for a scam he was running out of the Yale Law Library. Listen to this. The guy claimed to be a lawyer and was charging illegal immigrants $5,000 apiece to get green cards. They said this is the biggest scam pulled off at Yale since I guess George Bush got his diploma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man is now attempting to climb Mt. Everest wearing shorts. Shorts, yeah. That's how you know global warming is real, when people are climbing Mt. Everest in shorts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, people are so worried about this global warming. I have figured out a way to generate clean electricity. ... Put revolving doors on these rehab centers, so as celebrities come and go, you see, they would spin. As they go in and out, they generate...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier tonight, Larry King had the first interview with the tuberculosis- infected lawyer. Yeah. Did you see him? He was coughing. He could barely breathe. He looked like he was going to keel over any minute. And the lawyer didn't look good either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Europe, right now, for the G8 summit this week. And at one point, protesters got so out of hand that police used a water cannon on them. Yeah. Yeah, then President Bush did his part by pulling out his super soaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, in New Hampshire...ten Republican presidential candidates took part in a debate. Yeah, it was big news. Experts say, 'It was like many of history's classic debates, except with eight extra people.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

Oh, that sounds like Paris Hilton, doesn't it? Isn't this the same woman that had a hard time putting the two words 'that's hot' together? Suddenly, she sounds like Condoleezza Rice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, President Bush met with the pontiff in a library. It was the fourth time Bush has visited the Pope and his first time in a library.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'The L.A. Times' that just came out today, the latest poll shows Fred Thompson closing in on Giuliani in the polls. He's second. He's very popular. Well, he's popular with what they call the Republican base. He's considered a straight shooter.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll out today, Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls is due to her support by women. She's bringing in the female vote.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here is something that goes contrary to what we've thought for many years.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then,&quot; President Bush &quot;made a terrible mistake at the Vatican. Did you hear about this? President Bush referred to the Pope as 'sir,'&quot; as &quot;opposed to 'His Holiness.' I fire people for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in the country of Albania, President George Bush was mobbed by adoring, cheering crowds. Yeah. Yeah, Bush was overheard saying, 'I wonder who they're mixing me up with?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush gave a speech at a Republican luncheon where he pushed his immigration bill. Yeah. Reportedly, the Republicans in attendance didn't care for the speech, but the guys in the kitchen loved it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS News reports that the Pentagon once considered building a bomb filled with hormones that would turn enemy soldiers gay. It's true. A bomb filled with hormones that would turn the enemy gay, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon has confirmed rumors that it tried to develop a gay bomb, a bomb that used chemicals to make enemy soldiers attracted to one another. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insiders says this will be the biggest gay bomb since 'Rent' was made into a movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Chinese court has jailed two officials for allowing a blind contractor to build a bridge which collapsed during construction, injuring 12 people. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, this just in. Al Qaeda is claiming credit for the vague ending of 'The Sopranos.'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By God, here's a guy, Dick Cheney, our Vice President, you know, Dick Cheney. Trigger. The poor guy has had like 19 heart attacks and has a pacemaker. He needs a new pacemaker,&quot; so right now he's &quot;being rushed to Cuba by Michael Moore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush goes&quot; to Germany for the G8 summit, &quot;then coming home he goes to...Albania,&quot; where &quot;They took&quot; the watch &quot;right off&quot; his wrist. They &quot;say now that the suspect is armed and punctual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not a laughing matter. Don't kid yourself. It's an important watch. It's the one Cheney uses to hypnotize him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with the Pope this weekend. And he made a mistake, because instead of calling the Pope 'Your Holiness,' Bush called him 'sir'. Which you're not supposed to do. Yeah. Yeah, then, instead of kissing the Pope's ring, Bush went for a high-five and said, 'Up top, Popey!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, when President Bush was in Albania, they named a street after him. That's right. Yeah, during the street naming ceremony, Bush told the Albanians, 'I'm honored to be standing here on Lame Duck Boulevard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In political news, director Steven Spielberg has announced that he will endorse Hillary Clinton for president.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon has admitted they once tried to develop a gay bomb, a bomb that would turn enemy soldiers gay. This is true. They said their goal was to turn the Iraq war into a musical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gay bomb. You talk about a troop surge. There's a troop surge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the main ingredient in the gay bomb was Agent Orange with a chartreuse accent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when asked what impact this gay bomb would have, the head of the Joint Chiefs said, 'Fabulous!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian parliament has passed a bill that calls for the execution of Iranian porn stars. I didn't even know there were Iranian porn stars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And surprisingly, under Iranian law, they're not executing the porn stars for the sex. It's for the bad acting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Tommy Thompson&quot; gave &quot;a major campaign speech yesterday...to let everyone know he is not dropping out of the race&quot; and &quot;that he was entering the Iowa straw poll, and he intends to win it. And then the kid at the McDonald's drive-through said, 'You want fries, mister? We got to move.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news today. There's been a breakthrough compromise on this immigration bill everybody's been complaining about,&quot; and &quot;I think it's going to make everybody happy. You might have heard about this. Under this new bill, we let in 12 million illegal immigrants,&quot; but &quot;we deport Paris Hilton. That seems fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The major news today, Paris Hilton was transferred from the medical ward downtown in that prison to her old prison cell. I guess they need the space for Scooter Libby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scooter Libby going to jail unless -- they say -- unless President Bush acts quickly. Yeah. And today, the city of New Orleans says, 'Good luck with Bush acting quickly.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Father's Day, some lucky dad in Albania will be getting President Bush's watch. Did you hear about this?&quot; President Bush &quot;was visiting Albania, and somebody...stole his watch, just grabbed it -- and Bush is upset. He is really angry, and he says now he has no choice but to bomb Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Bush's watch was stolen, and I was going through the files, and I believe he is the first president to be robbed since, uh... Well, Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger told a Latino group that if immigrants want to learn English, they should not read foreign language newspapers. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton earned more than $10 million last year from giving speeches, but he says he gave half of it to charity. Yep. Clinton gives the other half to her sister, Tiffany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, speaking of that, Cheney is having an operation on his heart this week. Boy, you talk about microsurgery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran's parliament has voted in favor of a bill that would give the death penalty to people convicted of making pornography, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dan Rather came out swinging this week. He said that CBS and Katie Couric are tarting up the news. That's what he said, tarting up the news. As opposed to Dan who, you know, just made up the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, in Washington, President Bush attended the 6th Annual Hispanic Prayer Breakfast. It's a good thing to do, yeah. Yeah. At the breakfast, President Bush showed off his Spanish by ordering el Capitan Cruncho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has launched a new website where people can get all the latest Hillary news. Yeah, in a related story, John Edwards has launched a new website where people can order his secret blend of shampoos and conditioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranian parliament has passed a law calling for the execution of all Iranian porn stars. It's true. Yeah, of course, of course, in Iran, a porn movie is any movie where a woman exposes her chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all know by now a judge has turned down Scooter Libby's request to delay his prison term. In fact, the judge gave him an extra three months just for having the stupid name 'Scooter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you seen this new video? It's on YouTube, with attractive, sexy girl singing a song 'I've Got a Crush On Obama'. ... It was made by some of Barack Obama's fans, and this girl looks lovingly at the photos, and she sings the song, making all these sexy gestures. Well, now there's another one called 'I've Got a crush On John Edwards,' which is being sung by -- John Edwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican Party here in California has obtained a special visa to hire a Canadian...to be the state deputy political director because they say they can't find a qualified American to do the job. So, apparently, working for the Republicans is one of those icky jobs Americans just don't want to do, ladies and gentlemen. They have to bring people in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And although...this story seems to defy logic, it is absolutely true. We mentioned this last week. The Pentagon is admitting it did experiment with a gay bomb. They said it's no big deal. They were just experimenting for the weekend; the wives were out of town, they were just curious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard there was a huge problem with the Russian space station. The computers failed, the whole computer system went down, pretty scary. They're hoping to fix the problem and call tech support when they fly over India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, they have most of -- two-thirds of it has been fixed, although the system that controls the oxygen...is still down. That's been down for two days. A little scary. You know what happens when astronauts don't get enough oxygen. You know, they drive 900 miles in a diaper to kidnap other astronauts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an interesting case. After being found guilty of assault, a judge in Ontario, Canada, has ordered a man not to have a girlfriend for three years. That's his punishment. Yeah, three years without a girlfriend.&quot; Apparently, &quot;that's now a punishment. In fact, Bill Clinton is following this case very closely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants to see if the guy can do it. Because if Hillary gets elected, he's going to have to go four years without a girlfriend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Angel Cabrera from Argentina won the U.S. Open golf tournament. Very exciting, yeah. Yeah, Cabrera was congratulated. And then a group of Republican senators had him deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Barack Obama's Secret Service code name...is 'Renegade.' Very cool, yeah. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still using her old Secret Service name, 'Ballbuster.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the candidates, today Republican presidential candidate Sam Brownback kicked off a 1,200-mile campaign trip through Iowa. Yeah. Brownback said, 'I'm not going to stop until I find someone who knows who the hell I am.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Monday. ... Great day for America. Not such a great day for the International Space Station. All of their computers crashed. Must have been terrifying for the astronauts. No way to download porn in space.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study out of Cuba, 30% of Cubans are overweight. Of course, on the positive side, they can now float to Miami without a tire, so it's...a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in baseball news -- listen to this. You know who's being suggested to be the next commissioner of baseball after he leaves office? President Bush. ... President Bush, commissioner of baseball. You thought the games would never end now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'USA Today,'&quot; 72 members of Congress &quot;have given over $5 million of campaign money to relatives or companies owned by relatives.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton has a new campaign commercial out. It's a video spoof of 'The Sopranos' ending. ... I was watching the video, and Clinton's in it, Bill Clinton, and underneath it said, 'a special appearance by Bill Clinton,' Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A videotape has surfaced that shows a suicide bomber graduation ceremony at an al Qaeda training camp. See, that's when you know you're a bad speaker, you know.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, what do you say to a bunch of suicide bomber graduates? 'You are the future! Well, for the next couple of days, anyway. See you at the reunion.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Al Gore complained to the British press this week that everyone is focused on celebrities while the world is in crisis.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting news, according to a new poll, 15% of Americans say that Senator Hillary Clinton gives them the creeps. ... The other 85% say she gives them the willies or the heebie-jeebies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bloomberg says he's not running for president. He plans to finish his term as mayor. You know, like Hillary running for president, so she could finish her term as senator. Same thing, same sort of deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has picked 'You and I,' by Celine Dion, as her campaign theme song. In a related story, John McCain's campaign song also by Celine Dion. It's the theme from 'Titanic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question. How do you not graduate from suicide bomber school? How stupid are you to have to repeat a grade in that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how about the kids that drop out and don't graduate? Do they become depressed and lose the will to die?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Texas Rangers' Sammy Sosa has become only the fifth player in Major League history to hit 600 home runs. ... His teammates celebrated by dumping a bucket of steroids and cork on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has a new campaign ad that spoofs the 'Sopranos' finale.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new report that just came out suggest that television journalists are biased, because 90% of the money they donate to politicians goes to Democrats. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on CNN, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa accidentally called Hillary Clinton Senator Kennedy. See, that's when you know you need to lose a few pounds before bikini season, okay, when people mistake you for Ted Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donald Rumsfeld is writing a book about his experiences as Secretary of Defense. He had no problem starting the book. He has no idea how to end the damn thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this morning in London, police defused a potentially massive car bomb parked in front of the famed Piccadilly Circus. President Bush got a little confused. Yeah, he called the new prime minister to make sure all the animals and clowns were safe. I don't think he understands.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, authorities said the terrorist planned to detonate the bomb with his cell phone,&quot; but luckily, &quot;the guy had Cingular, so he couldn't get a signal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, President Bush's immigration bill failed to pass. To be fair, it's not the first time in his life George Bush has heard the term 'failed to pass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it was voted down by the Senate. You know, I wondered why the help at Wal-Mart seemed a little testy today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, some illegal immigrants are so angry, they are threatening to leave the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this bill would've established a bunch of new immigration laws to replace all the old immigration laws we didn't bother to enforce in the first place, so it's rather complicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said the Senate switchboard completely shut down after they got over 10,000 calls protesting the immigration bill -- 10,000 calls, all from Lou Dobbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other day at the Mexican-U.S. border, three illegal aliens were discovered under the hood of a Ford pickup truck crouched around the engine. ... When President Bush heard about this, he said, 'No, that was wrong.' He said, 'We don't call them engines anymore. They're now Native Americans.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Bush family compound in Maine this week. They're going fishing and boating. The press is calling it the 'Lobster Summit.' ... Now, don't confuse that with Paris Hilton's upcoming weekend in Maui. That's called 'Crab Fest.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts say the price of milk could rise to as much as $4 a gallon -- $4 a gallon for milk! I didn't know Dick Cheney was involved in the dairy industry. When did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another presidential debate last night, one of 90 scheduled before the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two movies opening today. The cartoon 'Ratatouille' and Michael Moore's movie, 'Sicko'. Two very different movies, of course. One's about a big rat who's obsessed with food, always getting into trouble, and the other one's 'Ratatouille.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was hot today, wasn't it? I'm telling you, I was sweating more than Bill Clinton looking at lingerie at Lane Bryant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story here in Los Angeles, it seems our mayor's getting a divorce and is dating a local TV news anchor. To which Rudy Giuliani said, 'Hey, when I was mayor that was a slow week.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Mayor Villaraigosa has admitted to being involved in an extra-marital affair with a newswoman from the Spanish language network. Yes. He said...'I had an affair with Miss Salinas, and over time it has evolved.' ... And of course, conservatives on the religious right are now furious with him. Not for the affair, for acknowledging evolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see all those doctors last week involved in that terrorist attack at the Glasgow airport? How scary was that? You thought the doctors at your HMO were bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday. President Bush turned 61 on Friday, but since he's President, he had his age commuted down to 59.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush...commuted Scooter Libby's jail sentence because he felt 30 months in prison for four felonies was way too harsh. So he reduced it a little, back to nothing! Zero!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's called 'the rich white guy reduction'&quot; because his &quot;name is Scooter. ... Not a lot of guys named Jamal getting that deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush told British reporters last week he wishes he was a better speaker. At least that's what they think he said. They're not quite sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they had the live concert over the weekend. How many watched that thing? Did you watch the Live Earth? Yeah, yeah. I guess they had a huge tree on stage. I thought it was a huge tree,&quot; but it &quot;turns out it was just Al Gore giving a speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. Al Gore's son, Al Gore III, arrested in Laguna Niguel, California. Police found marijuana in his car. Police searched the car after pulling him over for going 100 miles an hour in his Prius. When his dad found out, he said, 'Whoo, thank God it was a Prius!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were you stunned like me when you heard that? Well, I mean, come on. Did you think a Prius could go 100 miles an hour? I was shocked. ... What, was it going off a cliff?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot down in Washington. It was so hot down there, earlier today a chunk of ice fell off Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So hot, Scooter Libby wishes he was in the cooler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So hot today, President Bush pardoned Al Roker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So hot, Al Gore's son was doing 100 miles an hour in a Mister Softee truck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this? Al Gore's son was arrested speeding, doing 100 miles an hour, and Al has already made a movie about it. It's called 'An Inconvenient Son.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But earlier today, a new list of the seven wonders of the world was unveiled. The list includes the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal and the Colosseum in Rome. That's right. After seeing the list, President Bush asked, 'Hey, what about Space Mountain?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying the entire case against John Mark Karr was completely bogus. It was based on a bunch of ridiculous claims he just made up without any basis in fact. He made the whole thing up.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, of course, the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans. FEMA officials said it seems like just yesterday when they first arrived in New Orleans, and then they realized, oh, it was just yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was down there for the anniversary. The crowd was really excited Bush was coming -- until they realized, it was President Bush, not Reggie Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush toured several neighborhoods that are still mostly empty. And he had Dick Cheney coming along, you know, to shoot any looters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professors at Iowa State University say they're trying to find a way to turn fuel ethanol, you know, ethanol we use in our cars, into alcohol that people can drink. Well, that makes sense. Oh, yeah, you know, we have this huge oversupply of gasoline and such a short...liquor supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush, you know where he is? He's in New Orleans right now to mark the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Now if we could just get FEMA down there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, ladies and gentlemen, is the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It's the one-year anniversary today. Yeah. Not only that, it's the six-month anniversary of when President Bush found out about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, two Fox News journalists who had been kidnapped in the Middle East were released. Isn't that nice? ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican senator and family values conservative ? that's what he calls himself -- Senator David Vitter of Louisiana admitted he was a client of the so-called D.C. Madam in Washington. ... Well, now a second madam has come forward and told the Associated Press that he was also a customer at her brothel. This guy was cheating on his hooker with another hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this madam says that Vitter was not only having sex with a prostitute -- this is unbelievable. This is in the news today. I checked it. He would also pay them to dress him up in a diaper. A diaper? See, that's what you call a pampered politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she also said today, in an interview, that he sometimes paid $300 an hour just to have the hookers talk to him because he told the hookers his wife didn't listen to him. Well, I bet she's all ears now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff said today he had a gut feeling...there may be another terrorist attack this summer. Yeah. He has no specific intelligence to back it up, just a gut feeling. Oh, is that reliable? How do we know it's not just bad clams, okay? I mean ? 'False alarm! It was Long John Silver. We're gonna be fine!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, gut feeling? Isn't that ? doesn't that scare you? What, is the Weather Service going to&quot; start predicting hurricanes by saying, &quot;It's bursitis. Yeah, I can tell from my bursitis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Colin Powell said this week he once spent 2 1/2 hours trying to talk President Bush out of going to war in Iraq. Yeah. Well, actually, the first hour and a half he spent trying to get Bush to put down the Game Boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, because of the...war in Iraq, President Bush's popularity has now plunged to 2% BC. ... You know what that means, BC? Below Carter. It doesn't get any worse than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Bush's only supporters now are Laura and one of the twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And officials in Iran have announced that a man convicted of adultery there has been stoned to death. ... Imagine if they did that in Washington. They'd be out of stones, like, the first week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Hillary Clinton said, if elected president, she can work with Iran. They have common ground. Had to think back to the last joke. See, stoned to death. Hey, never mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Ted Kennedy spent yesterday reporting for jury duty but was dismissed because of conflict of interest. It turns out all 15 trials that day involved other Kennedys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And next month, right here in Los Angeles, the major Democratic candidates have agreed to appear on the first ever gay debate,&quot; where &quot;they will only debate topics concerning gay Americans, yeah. It'd be interesting to find out which candidate ends up on top and which end up on the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, each candidate has an appeal for gay voters. I mean, Barack Obama knows what it's like to face intolerance. John Edwards gets $400 haircuts. And, of course, Hillary Clinton is really in need of a makeover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the winner of the gay debate will go on to face Rudy Giuliani in the Cross-Dressing Caucus, which is right after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was on this day in 1804, Vice President Aaron Burr mortally wounded former Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton during a duel. Although, the Burr family now claims it was just a hunting accident. So I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sprint Nextel announced it has dropped 1,000 problem customers. They said if you call customer service to complain too often or ask too many questions, they dump you. They got this idea from the insurance companies after Hurricane Katrina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, ladies and gentlemen. Subway crime is down. So apparently the troop surge is working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new Harry Potter movie, Harry is prohibited from using his wand. ... I believe it's the same deal Hillary has with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Louisiana Senator David Vitter admits he's been visiting Washington area prostitutes. I thought about this. Wait a minute. A politician paying for a hooker? I didn't see that coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he said it did not cost the tax payers a cent. He pays for the hookers with his bribe money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. Osama bin Laden's son Omar just got married. Let's see how he likes being terrorized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you thought you had weird in-laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to send a couple of wedding gifts they have all the pipe bombs they need. What they really could use, they'd really like to have a fondue set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll just came out about Dick Cheney. This is a true story. A new poll finds that Dick Cheney has a 59% disapproval rating, which makes him officially the least popular Vice President in U.S. history. Even worse -- even worse, the only people polled where Cheney's wife and kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next month, the Democratic presidential candidates, all the democratic presidential candidates, will participate in the first even debate focuses entirely on gay issues. Just gay issues, yeah. Yeah, apparently, in the gay debate, when one candidate disagrees with another, they'll be required to begin their rebuttal with, 'Girlfriend, please.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I guess the Mayor got some good news today. He got a big endorsement from In-n-Out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on the Republican side, the darling of the religious right, conservative Senator David Vitter of Louisiana has not only admitted to having sex with prostitutes, he would pay them $300 to make him wear diapers. And today that crazy astronaut called him, 'My dream guy. He's got my vote. Oh, where have you been?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Vitter put out a statement saying he only started to cheat on his wife after he began hanging out with the wrong crowd. You know, Giuliani, Newt Gingrich...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A member of the Florida House of Representatives and the co-chairman of John McCain's Florida campaign, a man named Bob Allen, arrested for soliciting an undercover male police officer for sex. He offered to perform a sex act on the officer for $20. How broke is the McCain campaign?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is it with Republicans and weird sex? If it's not young boys, it's diapers, some other strange fetish. Why can't they just have sex under a desk with an intern like a normal person?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think GOP stands for 'Grand Old Perverts,' I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama have all agreed to appear at the first-ever gay debate. The whole debate will only deal with gay issues like gay marriage and things like that. They're calling it the first-ever all-musical presidential debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards said today he has always supported gay rights. Edwards said the only problem he's ever had with gays is, okay, maybe they charge a little too much for a haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the gossip columnist Liz Smith, Paris Hilton has been asked to campaign for Hillary Clinton. Yeah. I believe it was Bill that asked her, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that, Paris Hilton campaigning for Hillary. You thought a lot of people saw Hillary's last campaign video. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a 51-year-old British divorcee has just married one of Osama bin Laden's sons. I believe it's Timmy bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that amazing, she married one of bin Laden's sons? You know, sometimes when you're over 50 you don't really get the pick of the best guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that must have been a great reception. You thought you were nervous meeting your new in-laws. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And good luck getting through airport security on your honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A beautiful day down in Washington, DC. That senator from Louisiana took a couple of hookers to the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;David Vitter, I think is his name, and he has admitted now he dates hookers in Washington, DC. And also in Louisiana, yeah. He said in his defense he always selected the girl who made the lowest bid. So he's fiscally prudent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was talking about Iraq today. And he said that the United States, Iraq has met eight out of 18 of the benchmarks required in Iraq. 8 out of 18. You know, if things don't improve, people are going to start thinking the war's not going well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff. He says he had a 'gut feeling' that there could be a new terror attack. Said he had a gut feeling. Coincidentally, Al Gore said he had a gut feeling that he needed more pie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Osama bin Laden's son Omar, a couple of days ago Omar got married, ladies and gentlemen, sure, yeah. Bin laden has three sons. He has Omar, Mohammed and Little Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later this summer, the first-ever gay presidential debate will be held, where Democratic candidates will answer questions posed by the gay community. That's right. Yeah, question number one -- this is very good. Question number one ? 'Why can't healthcare be more fabulous?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson passed away at age 94. That's right, yeah. Laura Bush praised her as a pioneer and icon -- while President Bush praised her as a lady and a bird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he is opposed to medical marijuana. However, Giuliani did say he's a huge supporter of medical Rogaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Iranian man has been stoned to death for committing adultery. ... And today, the L.A. Mayor cancelled his trip to Tehran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Mayor Villaraigosa... means in Spanish? It means 'Duck, my wife is coming.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big story here in Los Angeles. As you probably know, our Mayor was found to be having a relationship with a TV reporter from Telemundo. See, political reporters and politicians should never end up in bed with each other. That's how we got into the Iraq war. That's how that whole thing started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Homeland Department Security Chief -- or is that -- Department of Homeland Security Chief, that's his name, Michael Chertoff, said he had a gut feeling Senator Vitter's marriage may be in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know this story? Louisiana Senator David Vitter has admitted he was a client of the D.C. Madam. Yeah, after she made...public&quot; a &quot;list of all her client's phone numbers. Here's my question. If you're so stupid, you go to a prostitute, you give her your real name and Senate office phone number, how did you get elected in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, the D.C. Madam said he sometimes paid $300 an hour just to have the hookers talk to him. Gave them $300, they didn't have sex. Another example of government waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's another sex scandal that has just stunned people. This is unbelievable, these politicians. It seems that a member of the Florida House of Representatives and the co-chairman of John McCain's Florida campaign -- a man named Bob Allen -- has just been arrested for soliciting an undercover male police officer for sex. He offered to perform a sex act on the police officer for $20. Remember the good ole days when during campaigns you only had to kiss babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the current issue of 'Sports Illustrated,' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has become a golf nut. She's pretty good, too. The only sand trap she can't get out of, Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bill Clinton about to publish a new book called 'Giving.' Giving' is the name of his new book. Really? Shouldn't 'Getting' be the name of his new book?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'USA Today,' more and more churches are taking in illegal aliens and shielding them from deportation. In a related story, more and more churches also report they are saving a fortune in housekeeping and gardening expenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Ted Kennedy reported for jury duty this week, but they refused to take him. ... Yeah. The judge said Kennedy's huge head would block the view of the other 11 jurors, so they couldn't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today, the Senate voted 87-1 to raise the bounty on Osama bin Laden -- $50 million, $50 million to get Osama. Which sounds like a lot until you realize we here in L.A. paid $250 million to get David Beckham. So, that's really not that big a deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush held a press conference yesterday to discuss the latest report out of Iraq. He says there's plenty of reason for optimism. Although I'm starting to feel he doesn't know what that word means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the President's approval rating keeps getting lower and lower. Look at this now. Right now, you can see President Bush is ranked somewhere between former President Richard Nixon and the hunter who shot Bambi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And by tomorrow, at this rate, he is expected to rank between John Mark Karr and Chinese toothpaste.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out on another hot day. Boy, it was hot today, wasn't it? ... It was so hot Mayor Villaraigosa had an affair with Ann Coulter just to cool off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the Mayor of Los Angeles have in common with President Bush? Apparently neither of them has any plans to pull out any time soon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest sex scandal concerns Florida Republican state Representative Bob Allen, who was arrested...for offering to perform a sex act on an undercover police officer in exchange for $20. ... Finally, a politician in Washington not afraid to put his money where his mouth is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden has released another new video. See, that shows how dumb this guy is. He releases it the same week as 'Harry Potter.' ... Nobody is going to watch this bin Laden video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's a videotape. Would it kill him to put out a DVD? Come on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's going around to garage sales trying to buy VHS ? 'Hey, you got a VHS to play this? Anybody?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, on this latest tape, bin Laden says that a happy man is one who dies for his religion. You ever notice that the one giving this advice is never the one blowing himself up? 'Oh, don't worry about me, Ahmed. I want to you be happy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Sports Illustrated' says that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is like a golf nut now. She plays golf all the time. And she went golfing with Cheney. Condoleezza shot an 83. Cheney shot two attorneys and an accountant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Des Moines, Iowa, former President Bill Clinton said he is backing his wife Hillary for president because she is the most qualified and not because of any spousal obligation. And believe me, if there's one guy who is not swayed by spousal obligation, it is Bill Clinton. So I think they're okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The L.A. Catholic Archdiocese has agreed to pay a $660 million settlement in the sexual lawsuit against Catholic priests. ... Yet nobody goes to jail, and they just get to write a check. Who do these priests think they are? Scooter Libby?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to former Vice President Al Gore. His youngest daughter Sarah married over the weekend,&quot; although &quot;Al couldn't enjoy the reception. He was so obsessed with how fast the ice sculpture was melting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. government is now offering $50 million...for the capture of Osama bin Laden. ... Are you like me, thinking, wow, do we really have that much left?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new, one of those creepy Osama bin Laden videos. He released a new video. This is extra creepy. Have you seen this on CNN or some place? In this one, the new video, he is eating a cheeseburger off the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Gilmore has dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Yeah, Gilmore said he dropped out because, 'I don't have the star power of a Tom Tancredo or a Mike Huckabee.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, he appeared at the press conference with his wife. Did you see the look on her face? Oh, my -- I haven't seen a woman that happy since New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey gave his famous 'I'm a gay American speech.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she said she forgives her husband, and she supports him, and her marriage is now stronger than ever. So, men, let that be a lesson to you. Things aren't working out at home, get a hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only in politics when a guy gets caught with a hooker does their marriage get stronger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in other political news, John McCain's communications director has quit. McCain had no immediate comment because his communications director just quit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest report, al Qaeda is increasing efforts to sneak into the United States, and they're getting pretty serious about it. I understand now they're learning Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you folks have seen the new 'Harry Potter' movie? Oh, man. It's just tremendous, isn't it? In this version of the 'Harry Potter' movie, Harry defeats the evil wizard with a secret potion from Barry Bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you aware of this fact? Tonight in Washington, D.C. Congress is working around the clock to try to solve the problem in Iraq. And I was thinking, well, geez, maybe they should have done that before we went in!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Congress is working all night and at least Senator Vitter's wife will know where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big night in Washington. You know about this? The U.S. Senate is planning on holding a session on Capitol Hill that's going to last all night. ... After hearing this, Bill Clinton asked, 'So Hillary won't be home until when?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential race heating up. According to a new AP poll, the most popular presidential candidate among registered Republicans is 'none of the above.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a report card on Iraq shows progress in only 8 of 18 areas. ... And, of course, President Bush is thrilled. That's the best report card he ever got in his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox News is now reporting there are people in the CIA who are working against President Bush's policy by using incompetence. Yeah. So, apparently, they're fighting fire with fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Manchester, New Hampshire, former President Bill Clinton bashed President Bush as a leader that is out of touch. He said Bush is out of touch.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Louisiana Senator David Vitter held a press conference this week where he admitted, yes, he was a client of the D.C. Madam.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's your Federal government at work. Ice that FEMA bought a couple of years ago for Hurricane Katrina&quot; is &quot;finally being destroyed. It cost $36 million&quot; for ice. Where &quot;are they buying this, 7-Eleven?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the new Zogby poll, the new Congress has hit another historic low. Only 14% of people approve of Congress, 14%. And that's just the hookers that worked for the D.C. Madam.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, did you hear what happened in Iowa the other day? ... Two women see Bill Clinton in a parade, and they thought he was Bob barker from 'The Price Is Right.'

It seems a worker at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, home of the atomic bomb, has been accused of stealing classified secrets on the uranium enrichment process to sell to foreign countries.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Wal-Mart is considering of investing in the retail business in China. But there are issues of employees. Slave labor, horrible working conditions and brutal treatment. But China said, 'Oh, Wal-Mart's welcome, anyway.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, anyway, Hillary is dressing sexier and sexier. Yesterday, she was seen shopping at Victoria's Pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's a bona fide babe now, Hillary. And she's telling friends she wants to be our Commander in Heat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I figured out what Lindsay Lohan's problem is. She wants to be an astronaut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's going on with NASA? NASA, of course, stands for 'National Alcoholics In Space.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, a panel investigating NASA found a heavy use of alcohol by astronauts before launches. On at least two occasions astronauts were allowed to fly while so intoxicated, they actually posed a health risk. Isn't that unbelievable, drinking? Maybe that's why they call it the Kennedy Space Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said today, on one mission, the astronauts were so drunk they actually were wearing their diapers on their heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why they go on the spacewalks, to sober up. Just kind of, you know, you get outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the advantage of being a drunken astronaut, you don't have to worry about falling down in zero gravity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the downside is, you throw up in your own face instead of on your shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But NASA now taking action. Today, they announced they are cutting off beer sales after the fifth orbit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news, the drunken astronauts, see they were...all hired by Northwest Airlines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news today for John McCain. John McCain's media team has resigned, yeah. But McCain says he intend to stay in the race, according to the campaign's new media spokesman, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Senator Hillary Clinton down there in Washington D.C. appeared on the Senate floor wearing a pink blazer and a skimpy top. Yeah, she looked so hot Senator Ted Kennedy sent over a drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She looked so hot everyone thought she was Senator Vitter's date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She looked so hot by mistake Bill hit on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA now says that on two occasions, they let astronauts fly on their space missions while drunk. But now they're cracking down. Like now, before they let them board, they have to close their eyes and touch their nose with a giant robotic arm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, this is why we haven't gone back to the moon. We'd like to go back to the moon. We're just too drunk to remember how we got there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, Vice President Dick Cheney had a device implanted that monitors his heartbeat. And to test the device, doctors had to induce a mild heart attack. You know how they did it? They told him that the price of oil dropped $20 a barrel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Working on Dick Cheney's heart, boy, you talk about microsurgery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems a little tiff...between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has really heated up since their last argument at the Democratic debate. They have become distant. They barely speak to each other now. And when they do...it's really icy. Or as Hillary calls that, marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to the Iraqi soccer team. They won the Asian Cup over the weekend. See, that's a huge deal over there. ... They said there was so much celebratory gunfire, you couldn't hear the regular gunfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend the Iraqi soccer team won the Asian Cup. Bud Selig was in the stands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Iraq now has a championship team so we can go home, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what a thrilling contest. Anybody see the finals? It was won by Iraqi soccer star Younes Mahmoud. You ought to see his wife, Posh Mahmoud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Birthday to Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 60 years old today. And to celebrate, natives on Skull Island tossed him a blonde.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...Arnold, like everybody, is getting old, and as a matter of fact, they're making a new documentary about his life. It's entitled 'Pumping Fiber.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is a sign your astronaut is flying drunk. Before liftoff, he runs a systems check on the blender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just going to be a huge scandal at NASA, astronauts flying drunk. 'Houston, we have a party.' Oh my!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new prime minister of Great Brittan, Gordon brown, met with President Bush this weekend, and he praised Bush's leadership. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, afterwards, even Bush said, 'That guy's hilarious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the White House announced they want to sell Saudi Arabia $20 billion worth of weapons. Yeah. Yeah. Saudi Arabia is going to pay for the weapons by giving us five or six gallons of gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the Iraq parliament adjourned for the entire month of August. ... Yeah. Experts predict there will be a lack of progress in Iraq during August, the likes of which haven't been seen since June or July.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several astronauts are denying accusations that they flew on the space shuttle while they were drunk. However, experts say the first step to recovery is admitting, 'Houston, I have a problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, Hillary spoke before the Senate topless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard about this? This is such a stupid story. 'The Washington Post' has criticized Senator Hillary Clinton for showing cleavage while speaking in front of the Senate. See, that seems sexist to me, doesn't it? They've never gone after Senator Ted Kennedy for doing the exact same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a scary incident yesterday for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. Luckily he's okay. You probably heard about this. Yesterday he collapsed to the ground outside his vacation home in Maine. Turns out he had a seizure. At first, people thought he'd just fallen over from leaning too far to the right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now see, for the young people, you know who John Roberts is? He is our most important judge after Simon Cowell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And happy birthday to our Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, 60 years old. Pretty amazing. And you know what's amazing, you can tell...he's getting up there. Remember he used to say things like 'I'll be back' ... Now he says, 'Ow, my back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iraq's new congress has adjourned for the summer, and they say they'll be back in September. See, that's how you know the war is going badly, when the Iraqis pull out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iran's president -- I never get this guy's name right -- Mahmoud I'm-a-nut-job. Is that what it is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very upset about the U.S. arm deals with the Saudis, because he says it will destabilize the region. God, just when things were going so well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new survey says 58% of the people who follow the news think Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez should resign. Of course, President Bush is not in that group, you know, of people who follow the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I love about politics. Gonzalez has been given a week to amend his testimony to Congress. Don't you -- only politicians get to amend their testimony. What does that mean? 'You know, that first pack of lies we came up didn't work. We need another week to come up with a new pack of lies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. Now doesn't -- isn't this whole administration turning into like a bad version of 'The Wizard of Oz'? I mean, Cheney needs a heart, Gonzalez needs some courage; Bush needs a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And hey, here's some good news. NASA announced they now believe they have discovered ice on Mars, which, of course, is great news. Not only does that mean that there could be life on Mars, but now astronauts will be able to keep their beer cold once they get up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've heard this whole story of the astronauts drinking. I don't know if the astronauts have been drinking too much or not, but I understand the next shuttle will be launched on December 31st so they can have the countdown on New Year's Eve, tie the whole thing in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Top Ten Signs President Bush Needs A Vacation: &quot;10. Ordered a full-scale invasion of Turks and Caicos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Staffers found him having a conversation with a coat rack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Asked CIA director to have Jason Bourne join hunt for Osama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Instead of signing bills, now licks 'em.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. So overworked he's pronouncing words correctly. Boo-ya!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. He's been drinking like an astronaut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hasn't given Laura the ol' 'veto' in months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot today, isn't it? ... It was so hot, Dick Cheney's doctors implanted a pacemaker and an icemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you talking about how sexy Hillary Clinton looks? ... Everybody is talking about it. She's dressing so much sexier. And folks down in Washington in the Capitol building say they haven't seen this much cleavage in the Senate since Ted Kennedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big interview on television tonight. Did you know this? Yeah, just days after having a heart procedure, Vice President Dick Cheney appeared this evening on 'Larry King Live.' Yeah. Yeah, doctors say he looked old, pale and sickly, and so did Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former president Bill Clinton recently said that if Hillary is elected president, he'd be glad to serve as a roving ambassador. Yeah, Clinton added, 'I've already got the roving part down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, many people from Cuba are sneaking into the United States through Mexico. Yeah. Yeah, apparently the hard part is squeezing the raft through the tunnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to congratulate Larry King. A lot of the younger guys on CNN, they get a lot of credit for going in dangerous places. They put themselves in the line of fire to get a story,&quot; but Larry King interviewed Vice President Dick Cheney, &quot;a guy with a record of shooting old men in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Larry did not fear. He sat right down without a flak jacket, without a pane of bullet-proof glass between them, and he did the interview. Larry may not have been frightened. But I, for one, at home, was frightened for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, as the Darth Cheney era grinds to an end, there's a new batch...hoping to replace him in the White House. One of them is Hillary Clinton,&quot; who is &quot;upset right now with a columnist from 'The Washington Post' fashion section. The columnist pointed out that Hillary showed a little cleavage during a speech that she made on the Senate floor a couple of weeks ago. ... Who would have thought that a controversy about Clinton and cleavage would be about Hillary?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? According to a new survey, 58% of the people following the news think Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should resign. Here's the frightening statistic -- 72% of the Americans who do not follow the news think that Alberto Gonzales is the guy who's married to Kelly Ripa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, it's Wednesday. Or as Hillary Clinton calls it, 'My Humps Day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is a stupidest news story. According to 'The Washington Post' Hillary Clinton has been showing a little cleavage out there on the campaign trail. And people feel this is why her lead over Barack Obama has increased. ... You know, I think there's something to it. In fact, today, Barack Obama made a speech with a rolled-up sock in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, John Edwards and his lovely wife, Elizabeth, celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary this week, the same way they do every year. He took her to Wendy's,&quot; which is &quot;where they met. So he took her to Wendy's for a cheeseburger, chili and a milkshake. See, that shows you how smart John Edwards is. Think about this. Most guys get an $8 haircut, have to take their wife out for a $400 anniversary dinner. He gets a $400 haircut and takes her out for an $8 dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House now demanding that Congress move quickly on a new treaty to allow more Arctic oil drilling, because they say the melting polar ice caps means more oil is easily available. See, this combines the two things the Administration loves -- global warming and drilling for oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and listen to this -- the Bush Administration now looking into the possibility of pumping Iraq's oil into Israel. Well, that should calm things down over there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, seven astronauts will board the shuttle Endeavour next week for an 11-day mission. They will blast off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and land a week from Saturday at the Promises rehab center in Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big story in Washington, D.C., -- not the war in Iraq, not Alberto Gonzales lying to Congress, not health care. The big story everyone's talking about -- Hillary Clinton showing a little cleavage. You believe how much ? it's amazing, isn't it? The United States is 231 year old, but apparently the media is only 13.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something -- those are not the boobs in Congress we need to worry about, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said today that he would not use nuclear weapons under any circumstances. ... I didn't realize his battle with Hillary had escalated to this level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a speech in San Francisco ? it's starting to get testy out there -- John Edwards called Rudy Giuliani 'Bush on steroids,' which, I think is unfair. I think he's more like 'Bush on Rogaine and Viagra.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Madame Tussaud's new wax museum in Washington, D.C., is going to feature a scandal room displaying likenesses of elected officials involved in sex, alcohol or ethical scandals. I mean, why would you go there when you can walk five blocks to the Capitol building and see the real thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in what's being called the most sweeping reform since Watergate, the House just passed an ethics bill, 411-8. You know what this will mean in terms of fighting corruption? Nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No -- but here's my question. They passed the ethics bill, 411-8. Who are the eight people who voted against it? Are they ? 'You know, there's way too much ethics. We need to get a little more dishonesty back in government, huh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the shuttle 'Endeavor' now preparing for an 11-day mission next week. The astronauts are calling it 'Road trip! Road trip!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And officials of the Chinese government announced that the new Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker movie, 'Rush Hour 3,' will not be shown in theaters in China. ... Speculation is the villains in the movie are Chinese, so they don't want it shown. ... This will be a huge blow to Jackie Chan fans in China. They might have to wait as long as five hours for a bootleg copy to appear on the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russia today said that they own the North Pole. ... Yeah, President Bush is furious. He said, 'That's ridiculous. Everyone knows the North Pole is owned by Santa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that things are going so badly for Senator John McCain's campaign, McCain has to carry his own luggage. Yeah, meanwhile, things are going so badly for Dennis Kucinich's campaign, he has to carry Barack Obama's luggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a group of Mexican officials crossed the border into Texas to see how the U.S. handles immigration enforcement. Yeah, as soon as the Mexican officials arrived, they yelled, 'Suckers' and headed for Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fisher-Price recalling one million toys made in China because they could be toxic. ... There's just a series of products from China that had been recalled lately for safety reasons. And today, China apologized. They said, 'You know, you just can't get good slave labor anymore.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the reasons they're recalling these toys is they contain excessive amounts of lead. So, your Tickle-Me-Elmo doll, that's not laughing, it's having a seizure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems a brain-injured man who had been in a coma for the last six years, is now awake, eating and speaking with his family. In fact, you know what you call a man who has been in a coma for the last six years? Mr. President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this has to be the stupidest story of the week. Hillary Clinton was chastised by the Washington press for showing too much cleavage in front of the Senate. Isn't that ridiculous? Shouldn't we be focusing on Iraq, not her rack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, former Arkansas state representative, a man named Jim Bob Duggar,&quot; and his wife &quot;had their 17th child. And right afterwards, he and his wife said they want more kids. See, another Republican with no plan to pull out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amtrak now offering passengers $100 in free liquor on some of their long trips. You go on one of their overnight trains, you get $100 worth of free booze. See -- that was one of the problems with Amtrak before, not enough drunken passengers onboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Free booze. I think they want people to get a chance to feel like what it's like to be an Amtrak engineer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to store owners in Iraq, Iraqi consumers are now developing a taste for American products like Pringles, Froot Loops, and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Yep. In a related story, Iraqis are also developing huge asses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Matt Damon. His movie 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' biggest movie opening ever for the month of August, made $70 million. ... In fact, today...Senator John McCain asked Matt Damon to be his running mate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you haven't seen the movie, it's about a guy who works for the government who can't remember his past. I think the original title is 'The Alberto Gonzales Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday at Camp David, President Bush signed a bill into law that expands his wiretapping powers. President Bush said he knew the bill would pass because he had bugs planted in both houses of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today in Washington, President Bush met with the president of Afghanistan, who was wearing that hat and the robe, you know, that traditional garb you wear. I think President Bush was a little confused. He thought he was meeting the professor from the Hogwarts School.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts...was released from the hospital after he suffered a seizure. It's the second time he's had a seizure. But as a precaution, when he returns to the Supreme Court, he will now have a robe that's open in the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody watch the Republican candidates debate this weekend? ... Last time I saw that many white guys arguing was the last Republican debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in India that is one of the leaders in providing outsourced customer service to American companies is now outsourcing its work to employs in Ohio. ... See, this is how a global economy works. When a Korean-owned business in a black neighborhood in L.A. calls a number in India for customer service and the Hindu in charge transfers it to a Latino working for minimum wage at a white-owned company in Cleveland,&quot; that's &quot;a global economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? Today Chinese officials recalled one million tons of lead because it may contain toys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Amtrak announced they're going to be offering passengers $100 of free liquor on some of their longer trips. It's the same deal NASA has on the space shuttle now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of that, NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander launched Saturday from Cape Canaveral. Once on Mars, the Phoenix will look for water, ice, beer, wine, liquor; anything that they can party with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Potential republican candidate&quot; Fred Thompson &quot;is now busy defending his much younger wife. ... In a recent interview,&quot; Thompson &quot;said that all criticism of his wife should be directed at him. ... As a result, conservative groups told Thompson he's been showing too much cleavage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iraq this week, the U.S. Army started using armed robots to patrol the streets of Iraq. ... Apparently, everyone thinks it's a good idea, except the armed robots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starting today, this is an interesting story, 'The New York Times' reduced the size of their newspaper. They cut the paper's width by an inch and a half. ... Yeah, the move was announced with the headline, 'Big changes At 'New York Tim.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it's warm here, it is really hot back east. ... In fact, in Washington, D.C., it is so hot, President Bush wasn't just reading other people's mail he was actually fanning himself with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush signed a law on Sunday that broadly expands the government's authority to eavesdrop on our telephone calls and e-mails without a warrant. Yeah. So our phone calls are being watched, our e-mails are being watched. The only thing not being watched -- NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting, a new study found that angry men get ahead in the world. Angry men tend to beat their rivals for power. So finally some good news for John McCain. Whew!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, tonight, there was another Democratic debate. Another one. God, it's hard to believe there are only 96 more to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And actor Sean Penn is currently touring Venezuela with President Hugo Chavez. Penn said between listening to Chavez attack President Bush and calling us 'the Great Satan,' he said it was like being back in Malibu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. government is now offering $50 million capture...for the capture of Osama bin Laden. ... Are you like me, are you thinking, 'Wow, do we really have that much left?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But to sweeten the deal, the money will be presented by Howie Mandel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week at a campaign event in Utah, hundreds of people showed up to hear a speech by Barack Obama. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, after Obama's speech, the Utah crowd said, 'That was great. Now let us know if an Asian guy ever comes to town.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hooters restaurant chain announced that they may open up a Hooters in the Muslim city of Dubai. ... Yeah. Apparently, the Hooters will open up right next to the Dubai Thank God It's Fatwa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this year, there was a story about Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones. He claimed he once snorted a mixture of cocaine and his dead father's ashes. That was the story, but he denied it. Now though, he's saying he did snort his dad. He cleared it up. He said there was some confusion. He explained he did not mix him with cocaine. He only snorted his dad. So, I guess we owe him an apology or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you remember the rumors that Keith Richards snorted his father's ashes with cocaine? Now Keith is saying these rumors are partially true. He did snort his father's ashes but he didn't mix them with cocaine. I suppose that would be disrespectful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway the biggest story today is from the Google people,&quot; who &quot;have a new version of Google maps coming out. ... Listen, if Google can use this satellite,&quot; why &quot;can't they find Osama bin Laden? I am serious. Why can't they?&quot; This &quot;is a 6'5&quot; man wearing a turban in the middle of the damn desert. 'Hey America, I am over here. I am working on my MySpace page.' I don't understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not everything can be seen on the Google maps. Some places have been blurred out for security reasons. Places like Dick Cheney's house have been blurred out. Who knows how many victims of hunting accidents are in that backyard?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you seen the horrible rainstorm in New York City? Oh, my God, the flooding. ... In fact, the flooding we so bad, Hillary Clinton had to switch from her pantsuit to a wetsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they had another presidential debate last night. ... It did not do well in the ratings. In fact, you know the 'two Americas' John Edwards is always talking about. Neither one of them was watching last night.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was pretty much the same old thing, you know. You realize the only Democrat introducing any new positions is L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa with the reporter from Telemundo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush's approval rating went up five points today. See, that's a good thing about these Democratic debates. As soon as they start talking, Bush's ratings go up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney said they will not participate in the Republican debate next month in Florida. John McCain said he will be there if he can get a ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Elizabeth Edwards is speaking out again. ... She said the problem with her husband John Edwards' fund-raising compared to the other candidates -- this is what she said -- she can't make him black and she can't make him a woman. That's the same problem Michael Jackson's people have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today, a very confused President Bush ordered a ban on all pencils imported from China, because he said they may contain lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Supreme Court Justice John Roberts back on the bench, even though he's prone to seizures. ... When President Bush heard that, he said, 'That's great because I'm prone to illegal searches. So we can get together and have searches and seizures.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news! The space shuttle Endeavour was launched, oh, a little while ago. ... Got off nicely. Sadly, one hour into the mission -- pulled over for a DUI.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new government study fewer than 40% of the space shuttle launches ever got off on time. And most of the time, the shuttle sits there on the launch pad for more than a day. And I think I found the reason. Show the footage. Take a look. Now, Alan, can you go on close, on the wing? What does it say there? See. JetBlue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Germany, a 59-year-old woman had a pencil removed from her skull that had been stuck inside her head for 55 years. ... Doctors say they don't usually see this much lead in someone's head unless they've been hunting with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge day in sports yesterday. Last night, Barry Bonds hit his 756th home run and broke Hank Aaron's record. ... Yeah, after the game, Bonds celebrated by injecting his ass with champagne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, President Bush did not call Barry Bonds after he broke Hank Aaron's home run record. But today, Bush decided to make the call. That's right. Bush said, 'I realized I had a rare opportunity to talk to the only guy in the country who's less popular than I am.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Latest from the presidential campaign. ... Hillary Clinton says she's going to reach out to health care employees by working a shift as a nurse at a hospital. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, Bill Clinton was upset and said, 'Great, this will ruin the plot of my favorite porn movie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Food and Drug Administration says the new fat-blocking drug Alli can cause gas and loose stools. Now as a result the FDA has insisted that all bottles of Alli have labels that read, 'This drug is safe and hilarious.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was another beautiful day here in Los Angeles. I almost feel guilty saying it because the weather is so miserable on the East Coast. ... It was 110-degree heat, floods in New York and New Jersey, they think a tornado may have hit Brooklyn. It is like Christmas morning for Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very, very big night for the very, very big-headed Barry Bonds last night,&quot; who now &quot;has the all-time record for career home runs. ... No surprise. There was a big skirmish in the bleachers for the ball. Collectors say it's worth somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000, which is a lot less than other baseballs. Some baseballs have fetched millions of dollars. I guess taking steroids really does shrink the value of your balls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people were wondering whether President Bush would acknowledge the record. He did. In fact, he told Neil Cavuto of Fox News today that he spoke to Barry Bonds on the phone. ... He probably wanted to take the rare opportunity to talk to someone whose approval rating is lower than his is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you feel the earthquake last night? ... Man, I'll tell you, the shaking was so bad, it actually knocked L.A. Mayor Villaraigosa off the female Telemundo reporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was horrible. In fact, it was so bad out at the Promises rehab center in Malibu, a large number of celebrities spilled their drinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, everything was shaking except peoples' faces in Beverly Hills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, this heat wave around the country, that's pretty crazy. It was so hot in Washington, both Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi showed up in Congress wearing tank tops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot in North Carolina, and humid, even John Edwards had a bad hair day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot in Washington, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales got delirious, almost started telling the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Democrats had another presidential debate earlier tonight. And they say they're going to keep having them until somebody finally watches one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. In Washington, Congress wants to spend $8 million to renovate the members-only private gym. I think that's a good idea. I'd hate to see Ted Kennedy get out of shape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I've got an idea. Why don't they take that $8 million, renovate a few bridges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First Lady Laura Bush and her daughter Jenna are writing a children's book together. It's about a boy who doesn't like to read and later grows up to become President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this story. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was asked to explain why none of his five sons are in the military, because he's very, you know ? he's supporting war and all of this. And he said that his sons demonstrate their patriotism by going on the road and campaigning for him. Oh, there's a tough choice, huh? Iraq or Iowa? Hmm. I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and it was...it was this week, I think it was yesterday, actually, in 1974, that Richard Nixon resigned the Presidency after getting caught lying and violating the Constitution. Remember when that kind of thing used to get you kicked out of office? Oh, thank God that can't happen anymore. Glad those days are gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush had his annual physical exam earlier this week. The White House disclosed that he was successfully treated for Lyme disease almost a year ago. ... And the President is taking precautions. In fact, he said today, he has not eaten a lime in over a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, a gay rights group sponsored a debate among the Democratic presidential candidates to discuss gay issues. ... Personally, I think Dennis Kucinich might be getting desperate because he showed up for the event wearing all leather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll like this, in a recent interview, President Bush's father said he gets upset when people tell him that his son is doing a bad job. Bush's dad went on to say, 'You'd think after 60 years I'd be used to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the President, the results of President Bush's annual physical were released yesterday. It revealed that last year President Bush got a rash from tick bite. ... After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'A rash from a tick bite? I'll have to remember that one.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there was another Democratic debate last night. I don't want to say it did bad in the ratings, but it had so few viewers it was declared an NBC primetime show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but, the debate was here in Los Angeles, and it centered on topics of interest to the gay community, which I don't understand. I mean, don't gay voters care about the same thing as straight voters? Come on -- health care, the war in Iraq, what's the deal with Clay Aiken? ... These are the issues we want to know about.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The brand new president of the Young Republican National Federation, 33-year-old Glenn Murphy, has resigned after one month in office after police say he was being investigated for performing an unwanted sex act on a sleeping man. Now, Murphy defended himself by saying the act was consensual. He may have had just too much to drink at the time. Well, what guy hasn't done that after a couple of beers, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, see, there you go. The Democrats may talk a good game at the gay rights forum last night, but the Republicans, they were actually out there doing gay things. Do you see what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush had his annual physical. And next week, Vice President Dick Cheney will have his annual autopsy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House revealed that, last year, President Bush was treated for Lyme disease. This is the disease spread by ticks that burrow under your skin. You don't even know they're there, you know, kind of like a government wiretap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has left for vacation, and his poll numbers are going up. So, basically, people approve of the job he's doing more when he's not doing the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, the government announced a new operation to crack down on the hiring of illegals here in Los Angeles. It's called Operation You're Going To Have To Cut Your Own Lawn And Raise Your Own Kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will work a shift as a nurse at a Las Vegas hospital. She's going to be working as a nurse. Boy, you thought your doctor's hands were cold.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And since she has no training or experience in the nursing field, she will only tend to patients that are in HMOs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'USA Today,' because of the rising cost of precious metals, the U.S. Government loses $100 million a year minting our money. Isn't that unbelievable? Only the government has the license to print money and still loses money doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like, they say it costs 1 1/2 cents to make a penny. You know what that means? Every time you put in your two cents, you're losing a penny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Newsweek' reports that the Federal government has dropped out of having U.S. students compete in international competitions that compares math and science students. They feel Americans cannot compete on a global scale in math and science. ... Let me tell you something -- our Asian students are just as smart as Japan's and China's Asian students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona is now paying high school kids to stay in school. Certain low-income kids will be paid $25 a week to stay in school. But now there's competition. The drug dealers have raised their price to $30, plus a company car and dental.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a tire importer has recalled 250,000 tires from China after they were deemed defective. And today, the people of Cuba said, 'Hey, if they float, we'll take them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet another presidential debate last night. That's right, the election is still a year an a half away,&quot; and &quot;we've had 90 debates so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've whittled it down to 690 candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night was a special one. Last night, during a debate sponsored by a gay group, Senator Hillary Clinton was criticized because of her husband's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. Yeah. Got a lot of criticism. In response, Hillary said, 'Sorry, but our entire marriage is based on me not asking, and him not telling.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Vick pleaded guilty today and faces up to...five years in prison. ... I knew this dogfighting thing would one day come back and bite him in the ass.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see him today? He said he turned himself over to God,&quot; which, &quot;ironically, spelled backwards is dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned. ... That's a terrible thing. Who knew he was into dogfighting, too? I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's some good news out of the White House. ... President Bush's daughter Jenna Bush is engaged. The bad news, she's marrying Rudolph Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand Dick Cheney is hoping for a shotgun wedding.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Jenna announced her engagement two weeks ago, although President Bush knew about it over a month ago from some, you know, wiretaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you would like to get the young couple something for the wedding, they are registered at Exxon, Mobil and Shell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a political forum here in Hollywood last week, Hillary Clinton said she does not support gay marriage. In fact, she says she's not too crazy about straight marriage anymore, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fred Thompson...said he's still testing the waters in his bid for the presidency. Now, he's been testing the waters for what, six months now? In fact, it's not wrinkles on his face anymore. He's starting to prune up from being underwater so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh! I was at Toys 'R' Us, the other night, and they had a display of Chinese toys, either regular or unleaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chinese official in charge of all those recalled toys has committed suicide. Turns out he stuck his head in an Easy-Bake Oven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And China...wants to send a manned mission to the moon. According to one of their chief scientists, China wants to map out every inch of the moon's surface. Apparently, they want to see if there's any signs of life up there and if that life can be forced to work 19 hours a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Alberto Gonzales Resigned: &quot;10. Felt he wasn't incompetent enough for the Bush Administration. 9. Secretly ordered himself to fire himself. 8. Was offered the John Travolta role in the touring production of 'Hairspray'. 7. Trying his hand at failing miserably in the private sector. 6. Didn't want to be around for transition to the Kucinich Administration. 5. Instead of terrorism, trying to keep Lindsay and Paris off the streets. 4. Got a sweet new job at Kinko's. 3. Letterman has a guy making a sand sculpture of Biff Henderson. 2. Ran out of laws to circumvent. 1. Why not go out on top?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful, beautiful day here in New York City. So nice today that Alberto Gonzalez was happy to be out of work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, during that last joke another Bush Cabinet member resigned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alberto Gonzalez is stepping down but he can't recall why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He will be replaced now by Drew Carey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russian leader Vladimir Putin -- have seen this guy? He gets his picture taken a lot with his shirt off, you know. And we used to have a pantless president. They got a shirtless president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was named sexiest commie alive, narrowly edging out Hugo Chavez and Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Il's brother, Menta Li Il.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But people are stunned. The Russian president appearing in public without a shirt. And I was thinking well, heck, our president often appears in public without a brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today -- you probably heard about this. After months of scandals and political pressure, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced he's going to resign. Pretty sad, yeah. Yeah, Gonzales...said, 'There comes a time when a man should resign and that time for me was last January.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for coming out. It's a hot day. ... Man, people were sweating like the men's room attendant when Senator Larry Craig walked in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that is my favorite story. Idaho Senator Larry Craig,&quot; a married, &quot;very anti-gay, conservative Republican was arrested by a plain clothes police officer for lewd conduct in a Minneapolis airport men's room. Today, the senator's office said it's all a big misunderstanding. ... Apparently, what happened was when the senator went in to use the restroom, he accidentally grabbed the wrong penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the undercover police officer said the senator tried to reach under the stalls to touch him, but the senator said...he wasn't trying to touch him, he was only trying to pick up a piece of paper off the floor. Who picks up paper off the floor in the men's room? I don't even like it when my shoelaces touch the floor in the men's room, okay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats may have control of the House, but the Republicans have control of the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, Senator Craig gave a press conference today, where he said, 'I am not gay and I've never been gay and then he apologized to his wife, Liza Minnelli.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a pretty busy day in Washington today. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Karl Rove rented a U-Haul together to help each other move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned yesterday. Actually, what happened was, he accidentally fired himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And even after announcing the resignation, Gonzales still not getting any respect. Today, Lou Dobbs called for him to be deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, some good news for the Bush Administration. While we were on break last week, Jose Padilla was convicted of being a terrorist. This is a victory for the domestic spying program. How many people thought Padilla was guilty? Curious. Okay. How many people thought Jose Padilla played second base for the Yankees?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the White House said today that First Lady Laura Bush will not be traveling to Australia with President Bush because she has a pinched nerve in her neck. Like many people, I think she got it by listening to her husband's speeches and going, 'What?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, oh, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very excited. We have senator John McCain on the program tonight. As you know, he is a legendary figure. He is the only living, straight, heterosexual, Republican senator left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to an article in 'The Beethoven Journal,'&quot; the &quot;composer Ludwig van Beethoven may have died from lead poisoning. Apparently, he had a toy piano as a child that was made in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another scandal in Washington.&quot; One &quot;of the senators from Idaho, Larry Craig, was arrested in an airport men's room. Gives new meaning to the word 'caucusing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Senator Craig said he made a mistake by pleading guilty. And I was thinking, well, maybe that was your second mistake. The way I look at it, anybody who spends more than two minutes in an airport bathroom is guilty of something, for God's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. My idea of getting lucky in a men's room is when the motion sensor works on the faucet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big scandal out of Washington. This is a huge story. Everyone is talking about this scandal. You probably heard about it. It was revealed today that Republican Senator Larry Craig from Idaho...pled guilty to lewd conduct in a men's room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they -- yeah. The senator said, 'I wanted to reach out to all my constituents and their penises.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll like this. According to a new study, Mississippi is the fattest state in the country, with 30% of its residents listed as obese. ... Yeah, which makes sense, because Mississippi state bird is the Chicken McNugget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember Lisa Nowak? She's the astronaut that put on a diaper, then drove cross-country to kidnap another astronaut's girlfriend. She has announced that she's going to plead insanity. Yeah, when they heard about Nowak's insanity defense, the jury said, 'Please, you had us at diaper.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of Boise, Idaho, is abuzz with the story of Larry Craig. He's a...conservative senator for Idaho. He pled guilty to playing footsie in the men's room of the Minneapolis airport. Now, he says he made a mistake and he shouldn't have pled guilty. The police were staking the bathroom out because it had become like a gay sex cubby hole. It's very interesting. The police said he tapped his foot, which means, 'I want gay sex.' It also means I'll never wear my iPod in the bathroom again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, he touched feet with the police officer. And he put his hand under the stall. ... And the funny thing, and this is true, he claims that the reason he touched the guy's foot, is he has a wide stance when he goes to the bathroom. He gets down like a sumo wrestler or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing, honestly, it makes your head spin. I had no idea there was so many customs involved in soliciting a man in the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Needless to say, this senator is...anti-gay marriage, he's anti-gays in the military. I think that shows he doesn't let his personal needs interfere with his work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crazy thing is,&quot; with &quot;all the video cameras and the internet, and the gossip websites, you'd think these guys would be smarter about what they do and say. And this is from 1999. This is Larry Craig, that same guy, talking about President Clinton and his well-known liaison with Monica Lewinsky.&quot; Sen. Craig (from the January 24, 1999 edition of NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot;): &quot;The Senate certainly can bring about a censure resolution. And it's a slap on the wrist. It's a, 'Bad boy, Bill Clinton. You're a naughty boy.' The American people already know that Bill Clinton is a bad boy, a naughty boy. I'm going to speak out for the citizens of my state, who in the majority think that Bill Clinton is probably even a nasty, bad, naughty boy.&quot; Kimmel: &quot;Let me just say something -- that is the gayest thing I've ever heard anyone say.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh boy, more trouble today for China. You know the...Great Wall of China? Turns out it has lead paint in it. The whole thing's got to come down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know by now, Republican Senator Larry Craig of Idaho pled guilty to lewd conduct in a men's room at the Minneapolis airport.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you see this in 'The New York Sunday Times'? They mixed up a picture of Iraq with a picture of New Orleans. Yeah, they said New Orleans was Iraq. This even confused the White House. They accidentally saw the picture and sent money to New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very bizarre story out of New York City today. Chemical weapons taken from Iraq ten years ago were found in a U.N. building in New York City. No wonder we couldn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They were here the whole time!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Bush Administration has given the green light for Mexican trucks to cross the border whenever they want into the United States starting this weekend, just to celebrate the new holiday, Illegal Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know about this? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Mexican trucks can now come into the United States whenever they want. I guess they figure since everyone is already here, now they're going to start bringing their stuff in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, you know what Wal-Mart calls a truck coming in from Mexico? Car pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else? Well, hey, congratulations to the Bush family. First Daughter Jenna Bush, the oldest daughter, is engaged...to be married. Couldn't be happier for her. The President said it's going to be hard to give away his daughter. You know, he said today, 'She is like family.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And home sales are the lowest they've been in five years. Five years. Realtors are desperate now. In fact, in L.A., it's so bad, on Sunday...my wife and I just saw a realtor having an open crack house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Bakersfield, there were three crystal meth lab foreclosures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Hillary Clinton Campaign Promises. &quot;10. Bring stability and long term security to 'The View'. 9. Each year on my birthday, every American gets a cupcake. 8. You'll have the option of rolling dice against the IRS for double-or-nothing on your taxes. 7. Having trouble getting a flight and Air Force One is available -- it's yours. 6. My vice president will never shoot anybody in the face. 5. Turn Gitmo into a Dairy Queen as soon as possible. 4. For over a century there have been only two Dakotas -- I plan to double that. 3. We will finally have a president who doesn't mind pulling over and asking for directions. Am I right, ladies? 2. I will appoint a committee to find out what the heck is happening on 'Lost'. 1. One more pantsuit joke and Letterman disappears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, Hillary Clinton is on the program tonight. ... And right after the program, she's attending a Park Avenue fundraiser hosted by Leona Helmsley's dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's how lovely it was in New York City today. Senator Craig came out of the men's room squinting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you've heard the story about Senator Craig from Idaho. Well, now, several prominent Republicans are calling for him to resign, and a couple are asking for his phone number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, hey, you know what happened today? It's our 14th anniversary here at CBS. Yeah. That's right. Thank you. Fourteen years. I'm just another dumb guy without an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news about the presidential campaign. Earlier today, Senator Fred Thompson, who, of course, is a former star of 'Law &amp; Order,' confirmed with his supporters that he is running for president. That's right. Yeah. Then, afterwards, Thompson promised to solve the crisis in Iraq by the end of the episode.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Washington, a group of pranksters covered Karl Rove's car with bumper stickers that read 'I Love Obama.' Yeah. Yeah, Rove laughed about it, then had the pranksters murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest, and I think the best Republican sex scandal yet, continues to unfold today. As you probably heard, Idaho Senator Larry Craig pled guilty to a misdemeanor after he got caught in a police sting operation in the men's room at a Minneapolis airport. Today, they released an audiotape they made after the arrest. ... The terror alert level in our nation's airport bathrooms has been raised to lavender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been one full year since Katie Couric took over the CBS Evening News. And to celebrate, CBS is sending her to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's going to report for two nights from Baghdad and two nights from Syria. I guess that should give CBS enough time to move the studio some place she cannot find it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you heard the Bush Administration has now given the go-ahead for Mexican trucks to cross the border into the United States any time they want.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some oil analysts predict that the price of gasoline could drop by a dollar a gallon by Thanksgiving. Is that really good news? I mean, think about that. You want cheap gas at Thanksgiving? This means relatives who live far away who couldn't afford to see you before, will now be driving to your place for the holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush was going to give the White House staff the day off for Labor Day, but then he realized that everybody resigned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today was Karl Rove's last day at the White House. Yeah. See, he wanted to wait until everything was just perfect before he left, you know. You don't want to leave the country in a mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Idaho Senator Larry Craig getting a lot of criticism from his fellow members of the GOP, which, of course, as you know, stands for 'Gay Old Party.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Census Bureau, New Jersey has the lowest poverty rate of any state. Isn't that amazing? Even poor people don't want to live in New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And new research shows that Beethoven may have been accidentally killed by his doctor. Yeah. President Bush heard about this. He was stunned. He said, 'Beethoven? I loved that dog. I can't believe it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, President Bush's daughter, Jenna Bush, engaged to be married. No date has been set for the wedding. You know, President Bush is against any kind of timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning in Iowa, two men took part in Iowa's first legal same sex marriage. ... Yeah, the judge pronounced them husband and husband, and said, 'Now, get the hell out of Iowa.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teachers are now urging American students to learn Chinese so that they'll be better prepared for the new global economy. That's right. Students will learn important Chinese phrases like, 'How much lead is in this pacifier?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. Forest Service says that marijuana plants are spreading throughout California's national forests and soon will cover over 6,000 acres of public land. Yeah, and -- folks! Even better -- the Grand Canyon is slowly filling with tequila.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all have a good holiday weekend? ... I had a big barbecue. We didn't actually have a barbecue, just put the food outside. It took about ten minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, it was so hot, in Barstow...they were actually cooking crystal meth on the sidewalk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is nothing like free-range crystal meth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush made a surprise visit to Iraq. Anytime Bush shows up in a war zone, that's pretty much a surprise, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which I think is why President Bush was a little confused. When he got off the plane into about 115 degree heat and saw all those guys walking around with the big guns, he said, 'What are you doing in L.A.? I thought we were going to Iraq.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is very upset...the Iraqi parliament has failed to pass any major legislation since taking office. It has not passed any legislation. Of course, on the other hand, it made him feel right at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is very optimistic. God bless him, he's nothing if not optimistic. In fact, today, he said things in Iraq are getting gooder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is today&quot; in &quot;Australia for the big economic summit that's going on there. See, again, I don't mean to be disrespectful. I don't think President Bush knows a lot about Australia. Like today, he said he was anxious to visit the home where Arnold Schwarzenegger grew up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So President Bush announced that he plans to help out homeowners in this mortgage lending crisis thing that's going on. He said he's worried millions of people could lose their house and, you know, he knows what he's talking about. Last November, he lost the House and the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now official -- this week, Mexican trucks began rolling across our border with their first cargo. Trucks can now come in from Mexico to the United States. They can come any time they want. They brought first their load of stuff. It was unsafe, leaded toys from China. That's their first cargo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Larry Craig was arrested in a big sex sting operation in an airport bathroom. He resigned from the Senate. He stepped down. Thankfully, he was able to do it quietly before the whole thing turned into some kind of media circus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Senator Larry Craig from Iowa resigned from the Senate. He says he now would like to spend more time not being gay.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Chemical Ali? ... Listen to this. Today he was sentenced to death, Chemical Ali. Yup, yup, a bad actor that guy. Oh, yeah. It's going to be tough on his two sons, Chemical Zach and Chemical Ryan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, how about that President Bush. Yesterday he made a surprise visit to Iraq. ... I don't know whether it was the jet lag or whether he was just confused, but he served the troops Thanksgiving dinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Iraq for eight hours. Nice to see he has an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, President Bush left the White House in an unmarked car and took a top secret trip to Iraq. Yeah. ... In fact, the trip was so secret, President Bush still doesn't know where he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, two Fox News journalists who had been kidnapped in the Middle East were released. Isn't that nice? ... Afterwards, the Fox News journalists said, 'It was the worst experience since being trapped at the Christmas party with Geraldo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks for your applause. In fact, any hand movement at all helps cool things off in here. It has been so hot. ... This morning, Governor Schwarzenegger announced an emergency, statewide wet t-shirt contest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other parts of the country may be able to handle this. I know they laugh at us in Phoenix and Las Vegas. But this is L.A. Many of us are made primarily of plastic. We cannot take it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the fact that he announced his resignation on Saturday,&quot; Sen. Larry Craig's &quot;spokesman now says he may not resign. ... He's guilty. He's not guilty. He's resigning. He's not resigning. He's gay. He's straight. Can this guy make up his mind already?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he's pled guilty to the charges, he's hiring lawyers to work on reversing his plea from guilty to not guilty. And he's not stopping there. He's also suing himself for defamation of character.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Fred Thompson on the show tonight. He says he has something major to announce. Something major to announce. Now, in America that can be only one of three things. He's either pregnant, gay or running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek has a big cover story on Fred Thompson's presidential campaign. You'll learn a lot about him. For example, he married when he was 17. He was a 17-year-old when he which caused a huge scandal in his small hometown in Tennessee. Apparently he chose to marry outside the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thompson has some tremendous pluses on his side, for example, he used to work at NBC. So, apparently he knows how to deal with disasters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked what his plans were after he leaves office, President Bush says he'd like to make money giving speeches. He wants to give speeches? Well, you can't say the man doesn't know where his strengths are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush in Australia for, I guess, some kind of economic summit meeting going on in Australia. Now here's something interesting, you know when President Bush is in Australia, his approval rating goes down the drain counterclockwise?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that President Bush? He makes the surprise trip to Iraq. Pretty impressive, don't you think? Yeah. And spent a couple of quick hours visiting with the troops. Then he left. It was like his days in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new book, President Bush cries when he is alone, cries when he is alone, never admits to mistakes and refuses to hear bad news. Oh, no wait, that's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night on our show, Fred Thompson announced he strongly supports the war in Iraq. God, when are these Hollywood actors going to learn to keep their political opinions to themselves on talk shows?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new Pew Research poll, over 60% of people in the country of Jordan consider Americans to be rude. It's not that bad when you consider that over 100% of people from other Middle Eastern countries think Americans are Satan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country of Spain has authorized the use of putting straitjackets on illegal immigrants when sending them back to their own countries. Yeah. See, that's something -- that's something here, they'd never have to worry about it. You know, being sent back to their own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York's taxi drivers are now out on strike. Yeah, yeah, out on strike. Luckily, most of them still have jobs in al Qaeda to fall back on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Republican debate last night? You know a debate is dull when the most exciting guy there is Brit Hume.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Side effects of the Republican debate include dizziness, nausea and sexual dysfunction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard something interesting today. After he leaves office, George W. Bush is going to start a think tank. A think tank. It's like Michael Vick opening an animal shelter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, the Bush, George Bush think tank. It only has a shallow end.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the NFL season opener was last night, right here on NBC, the Indianapolis Colts beating the New Orleans Saints, 41-10. The people of New Orleans haven't been this disappointed since last week when President Bush visited them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden is set to release yet another videotape. He likes to make an appearance. He makes an appearance about once or twice a year to show he's still alive, kind of like the Rolling Stones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you notice -- that is the latest picture of bin Laden, and do you notice his beard is now black? Didn't it used to be gray? I think he's dyeing it. Forget...the Mideast crisis. I think he's having a mid-life crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what he's using? I guess this is what they use over in the Middle East. This is 'Just For Nut Jobs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Fred Thompson's little brother, Dr. Phil, on the show tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Senator Thompson announced on our program Wednesday night he is running for President of the United States. Now, did you...know this? Interesting story. Senator Thompson married his first wife when he was 17. And ironically, he married his second wife when she was 17.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, 'The L.A. Times' reporting, I guess, when Fred Thompson was in school, he was kind of a hell raiser. I guess he was known for tossing ice in the cafeteria, making paper airplanes and throwing pennies at the black board when the teacher wasn't looking, which ironically is the exact same thing President Bush does now at Cabinet meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's a big summit meeting in Australia. President Bush called the APEC conference the OPEC conference. He called the Australian troops Austrian troops. And he left the stage the wrong way. He was given the wrong information when he got there. He stumbled when he was there and couldn't figure out how to leave. It's like Iraq all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the country of Spain has authorized putting straight jackets...on illegal immigrants caught in their country and sending them back. We do a similar thing here in America when we catch them. We put them in Wal-Mart uniforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mattel has issued a third recall of toys made in China. Chinese officials are doing what they can to try and remedy the situation. In fact, today, the head of the Chinese toy company gave a pep talk to his employees. You know what he told them? 'Get the lead out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what Sunday is? Always something big and exciting in New York City. Farm Aid Sunday here in New York City. ... Because when you think farms, you think New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former 'Law &amp; Order' star Fred Thompson is running for president now, and he just unveiled his campaign slogan. His campaign slogan is 'United In Our Core Beliefs.' Yeah. If the slogan's a hit, Thompson plans to unveil another one, 'United In Our Core Beliefs: Special Victims Unit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week President Bush met with Chinese President Hu Jintao. And Hu invited Bush to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics in China. Isn't that nice? Yeah, very nice. Yeah, Bush told the Chinese president, 'I'm busy next year, but pencil me in for the 2009 Summer Olympics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of President Bush, a new biography quotes Bush -- this is true -- as saying he would never discriminate against someone based on their 'gay-dom' or 'gay-hood.' Bush goes on to say, 'That's the price we pay for living in a 'Gay-ocracy.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a new video has emerged from Osama bin Laden, and it's strange. It appears bin Laden is now dying his beard to look younger. ... First, people were unsure why bin Laden wanted to look younger, but then today he joined Match.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a big day of dumbness yesterday. He was in Sydney, Australia, for the APEC summit. That's a gathering of 21 countries that are responsible for half the world's trade. And he started off saying he was happy to be at the OPEC summit, which is...an entirely different thing. Then he called Australians Austrians, which they are not. And then, at the end of the speech, he went the wrong way and almost fell off the stage. Somebody had to grab him. So it was really a banner day for the President. With Karl Rove gone, the President is like a slightly inbred golden retriever that slipped off its leash.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I guess you know the big story. General Petraeus says he believes Iraq has gotten better, but unfortunately, Britney Spears has gotten worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Osama bin Laden has released a new video. Plus, he has updated his eHarmony profile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, in his latest video, Osama bin Laden urges all Americans to reject democracy and convert to Islam. Well, I could see that happening. What's this guy, living in a cave? Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, bin Laden said he wants Americans to convert to Islam, listen to this, because he says there are no taxes in his world, which is true. There are no taxes. There's also no music, no ice, no books, no music. And from the looks of bin Laden, no toothpaste or deodorant either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was in Australia, President Bush, I guess you heard about this, accidentally referred to Australian troops as Austrian troops. Then he called it the OPEC summit instead of the APEC summit. Yeah. And even though he made a lot of mistakes, I thought this was nice, you hear about this? He still got a congratulatory phone call from Ms. Teen South Carolina,&quot; who &quot;said, 'Hell of a job.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got in a very testy exchange with the president of South Korea over North Korea. Did you hear about this? The South Korean president wants the U.S. government to officially end the Korean War, which was 55 years ago. We never officially ended that war. They want an official end. But you know President Bush, he doesn't like setting timetables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the University of Minnesota, buildings and rooms with high dome ceilings help people think better and help them think smarter. They say the bigger the domed ceiling, the smarter people in it think. Think that's true? Yeah? Explain Congress. Does the dome get much bigger than that? Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And have you heard the latest on...Senator Larry Craig? ... He has taken back his guilty plea. Withdrawn his guilty plea. He's changed it to just curious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Senator Fred Thompson, who announced he's a presidential candidate on our show last week, is out on the campaign trail. You've probably seen him. And Fred Thompson's wife, you may have noticed, very attractive woman. She is 24 years younger than he is. Very attractive woman, yeah. In fact, he's got four Secret Service agents keeping an eye on the two Secret Service agents who are keeping an eye on her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'The New York Times,' more and more people in the United States are buying items that say made in America, which is good. Ironically, the label that says made in America, actually made in China, okay, but we're making progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Britney Spears Excuses: 7. I was distraught after reading General Petraeus's Iraq report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the MTV awards? And the Britney Spears things, did everybody see Britney Sears. Well, they said she appeared sluggish. They said she was glassy eyed. ... Although General Petraeus thought it went quite well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But critics and insiders are saying that bin Laden's new video is only a sad attempt to try to stay relevant. That is the same thing they are saying about me going on 'Oprah.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, today, General Petraeus testified before Congress. And he said, 'The military objectives of the surge are in large measure being met.' That's what he said, yeah. Yeah, a lot of people doubt Petraeus' credibility because he also testified that Britney Spears was great on last night's MTV awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting little fun fact, the state of Arkansas says it has successfully reduced the number of obese people in that state. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently, Arkansas did this by throwing a Twinkie over the Missouri border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Senator Craig tried to change his plea. He was charged with disorderedly conduct. He originally claimed guilty. Then he changed it. ... He said he didn't understand the guilty plea. He's a senator of the United States! It's not just that you should understand the law -- you make the law!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the Secret Service had a little scare yesterday. Did you hear about this? Pretty scary. For a couple hours, they could not find President Bush.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in this new video -- you heard about this? Osama bin Laden makes a pitch to America by attacking the Democrats and says we should all...convert to Islam because there are no taxes. He's now running third in Iowa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you, is it me, or is bin Laden getting more western in these videos? Like in this new one, where he wants us to convert to Islam. He says if we act now, he'll throw in a free prayer rug. 'Call me crazy! Call me crazy Osama!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you all know, Britney had a rough opening night at the MTV Video Awards the other night. She got confused, lost her place. She called APEC OPEC. ... She thought the back-up dancers were Austrian instead of Australian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Tennessee, Democratic state representative, a guy named Rob Briley, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, got drunk, fled the scene of the accident; led police on a 100-mile-an-hour chase. And when the cops pulled the guns on him, he demanded to finish his drink. He's now being charged with impersonating a Hollywood celebrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier today the big Iraq report. General Petraeus, he says that these troops can start coming home next summer. I believe his exact words were, 'And then it's Hillary's mess.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Petraeus testified again today before Congress about the Iraq war. Some Democrats are claiming that Petraeus' answers are scripted by President Bush,&quot; which &quot;explains Petraeus' use of the word 'surge-rific.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several Jewish groups are upset because President Bush issued Rosh Hashanah greetings over a week early. So, they're saying Bush doesn't know when Rosh Hashanah is. Yeah. Bush says he'll make up for the mistake by sending them all something nice for Christmas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I turned on the MTV Video Music Awards,&quot; and &quot;there was a battle offstage&quot; between &quot;Pamela Anderson's ex-husbands. Kid Rock punched Tommy Lee in the jaw. ... Apparently, Tommy was saying that U.S. troop presence in Iraq should be maintained until the security situation is stabilized to the point where meaningful political progress...is possible. But Kid Rock felt that political reconciliation between the warring Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders is impossible because of the deep-rooted religious animosity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intelligence officials believe that video of Osama bin Laden that came out last week is authentic. This is his first new tape in almost three years. I guess he wanted to time his comeback to coincide with Britney Spears'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Rosh Hashanah. This is the first night of the Jewish holiday. ... See, I'm not sure if President Bush really understands Jewish holidays. Like today, he kept asking his staff when he could start looking for the painted eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually it's both Rosh Hashanah and Ramadan. The holiest time of the year for both the Jewish people and Muslim people. And you don't want to get those two celebrations mixed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden has come out with yet another video. People are already criticizing it. They say he looks fat, he's dressed inappropriately, the lip syncing is way off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with most of the country against the war, our top military man in Iraq, General Petraeus, says he does not know if the war is making us safer. That was the big comment yesterday. ... In fact, for a lot of people, it's more dangerous, like Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A New Orleans prostitute has come forward and said that she had sex with married Louisiana Senator Dave Vitter two or three times a week, over a four-month period.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Senator Vitter is denying this woman's allegations. Well, whose -- credibility-wise, who are you going to believe? A U.S. senator or a hooker. I've got to go with the hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson now tied, neck and neck in national polls. Actually, you know, if they were on the ticket together that would be a tough team for the Democrats to beat. I mean, if they could just get all of their ex-wives to vote for them, oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Russia has tested a new bomb that they say is as powerful as a nuclear bomb, but does not contaminate the environment the way a nuclear bomb does. So now, you see the Russians are going green, huh? Yeah, taking that global warming seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study by a labor rights group says that workers making 62 cents an hour...at the Disney toy factory in China are underpaid, exposed to dangerous chemicals and forced to live in filthy conditions. And the worst part? They keep playing that song, 'It's a Small World After All.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PETA and other animal rights groups have started an active campaign against eating meat. They say the meat industry is a bigger contributor to global warming than all transportation combined. ... I try to eat meat more responsibly. For example, I only eat roadkill that's been run over by a Prius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the big game on Sunday the Patriots and the Jets, the New England patriots were secretly videotaping signals from the Jets sidelines? Maybe we should put these guys in charge of looking for bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In China, a group of workers who make toys for Disney say they are forced to work 28 days a month and up to 15 hours a day. Yeah. Yeah. A spokesman for the Chinese factory said, 'Look, these toys aren't going to lead paint themselves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier tonight, President Bush gave a historic speech on the war in Iraq. Of course, most Americans are going, 'Never mind that. Did you see Britney? Oh, my God.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this week, General Petraeus has been testifying before Congress. And today, a number of senators accused General Petraeus of lying. And you can understand why they're upset. I mean, if you're going to try to deceive the American people, you do it the right way, you run for Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, on the 'Today' show today, Matt Lauer was in Iran. He was in Iran. Yeah, he was in the streets of the capital, Tehran. And the traffic was really heavy. So apparently, Rosh Hashanah, not a big holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And finally, it was on this day in 1977 that Billy Crystal appeared in the TV sitcom 'Soap' as the first openly gay character on television. That was the first time, yeah. And today, Senator Larry Craig said, 'I never watched that show!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Happy Rosh Hashanah, ladies and gentlemen, the Jewish New Year. ... Today down in Washington, D.C., a confused President Bush carved a pumpkin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush announced to the nation that he promised to have Lindsay Lohan out rehab by next summer. That will be good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, gorillas are almost extinct. ... And the situation is serious, it is grave. Earlier today the Governor of California was placed in a captive breeding program.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, former President Bill Clinton says that most people don't know that Hillary has the world's best laugh. ... Bill added, 'I get to hear it every time she pushes me down the stairs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight,&quot; President Bush &quot;gave his eighth speech to the nation about Iraq. ... In it, President Bush promised to have the troops home by speech number 73.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush addressed the nation tonight. ... They say it was a crucial speech, one that could determine the future of the war. And aides say the President went through at least 20 drafts of this speech before he delivered it. And still, he has no idea what it means.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess kids are text messaging while they're driving, which is dangerous. It's a tough bill, though.

You could do it 1,000 times, and it's $50.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here in California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a new law that says kids under 18 cannot use cell phones while driving, unless it's an emergency.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of John Kerry, a University of Florida student was tasered after asking John Kerry about the 2000 election.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably saw the footage on the news. In fact, John Kerry was so shocked when it happened, he almost showed a facial expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when Scott Pelley...on '60 Minutes'&quot; told &quot;'I'manutjob' that the American people would be very insulted if he visited ground zero, the Iranian president disagreed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess 'Resident Evil' drew a lot of attention this past weekend. Not the movie, the Iranian president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the president of Iran, Mahmoud 'I'm A Nut Job' has arrived in the United States. You know he was issued a visa to come here? Isn't that amazing? You need a visa to get into the United States now? When did they start with that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the interesting part? After he landed, he actually drove his own cab in from the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, earlier today -- earlier today, 'I'm A Nut Job' spoke to students at Columbia University. You know why he chose Columbia? ... Because he said Notre Dame's football program sucks this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'I had to go to Columbia.' Now, it was tricky, because he had to have an interpreter that could lie in two languages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there's a lot of controversy over letting him speak at Columbia. Although the dean of the university said that he would even let Hitler speak. That's what he said. Apparently, he didn't realize he just did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, as you know, -- 'I'm A Nut Job', whatever his name is ? he's against drugs, he's against alcohol, against premarital sex, against homosexuality and pornography. What's he speaking at a college for? Good luck finding any common ground with those kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech, he said, 'There are no homosexuals in Iran.' That's what he said. Too bad, because they need somebody to choreograph those parades they have every week, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report out of Cuba, Fidel Castro is near death, but is clinging to life, and he is determined to outlive the Bush Presidency. Wow. Just like Dan Rather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Dan Rather is suing CBS after being fired by them. He now anchors the weekly news program in HDNet TV. This is a cable channel owned by Mark Cuban. I don't want to say the audience for this show is small, but Dan opens the broadcast every night by saying, 'Good evening, Mark.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton gave an interview to the gay magazine 'The Advocate.' And when asked about the rumor that she was a lesbian, Hillary denied it. Hillary said she is not a lesbian. And a confused President Bush said today he has no problem with anybody being a lesbian, as long as they are in this country legally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani also on the campaign trail. He spoke to the NRA -- the National Rifle Association -- last week. And he tried to appeal to them by saying that two of his marriages were shotgun weddings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the 'Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans is out. Everybody on the list is now a billionaire. You can't even be a millionaire and be on the list. You have to be a billionaire to be on the list. So, see that? The Bush tax cuts are working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks are here on a great week. It is Lunatic Dictator Week in New York City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is here to visit the U.N. and also to recover some stolen sports memorabilia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier today Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia University. Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen, there hasn't been this many angry protesting students at a college since Ball State named a building after me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran gave a speech in New York City today, and thousands of New Yorkers are really upset about it. Yeah. Yeah, the New Yorkers said, 'If we want to hear a short-tempered Iranian man yell at us, we'll take a cab.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But during his speech at Columbia University, President Ahmadinejad says his country, this is a quote, 'doesn't have a problem with gay people because they don't have homosexuals in Iran,'&quot; which &quot;finally explains why Ahmadinejad gets away with wearing a windbreaker from 1983.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke at a conference on global warming, and he said, 'The time has come to stop looking back at the Kyoto Protocol.' Yeah. Afterwards, people said, 'We didn't solve anything, but it was really fun hearing Arnold saying 'Kyoto Protocol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Saturday, President Bush will be on hand in Washington to celebrate the seventh annual National Book Festival. That's right. The President is very excited about the festival because he's been named Cliff Notes' Man of the Year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as you know, yesterday at Columbia University, it was 'Take Your Insane Dictator To Work' day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was lot of controversy about letting the Iranian president speak here in the United States, much less at a university. And you know something? I have to admit, I didn't like it. I was bothered by it. I mean, if he wants to condemn this country and our president, you do it the proper way, okay? You win an Academy Award. That's the forum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, instead of New York, I wish they invited Ahmadinejad to California. See, then it would have been fun trying to watch Governor Schwarzenegger introducing him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, former President Bill Clinton was asked how he would handle being First Husband. You know, if Hillary gets elected. That would be his title, First Husband. He said he had no problem with being First Husband. Being a husband first, that's the big one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I was a little disappointed to hear this. Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mitt Romney and John McCain all said they cannot attend the minority debate this week at Morgan State University, because they have scheduling conflicts. They're scheduled to meet with rich white people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NASA said today they would like to put a man on Mars by the year 2037. In a related story, the Los Angeles District Attorney said they would like to put a celebrity accused of murder in prison by the year 2059.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Beijing government is allowing a Hooters to be built as part of an effort to upgrade the city for next year's Olympics. ... Imagine that. People in China will now be able to eat Hooters chicken wings. See, this is payback for all the lead toys they sent us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Things Overheard During President Ahmadinejad's Trip To New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Being here makes me realize how much I miss torturing dissidents.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'I would like to meet Whoopi.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'For a blood-thirsty madman, he dressed pretty sharp.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Let's go to Mahmoud on the car phone who wants to talk about Notre Dame Football.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'He looks more 'Ahmadinejad-I' in person.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Yes, Mahmoud, I got it-- In America you watch TV, In Iran TV watches you.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Death to overpriced midtown parking garages.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Instead of dealing in terror, maybe we should look into this sugar business.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'You call this Times Square? Where's the porn?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'I thought I was a prick, but then I met Donald Trump.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ladies and gentlemen? What a guy this guy is, huh? According to this guy, he says there are no homosexuals in Iran. I guess that explains the pathetic state of their musical theater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did you see Ahmadinejad's speech at the U.N.? At one odd moment in the middle of the speech, he took a cell phone call from Mrs. Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would just like to say a couple of words about Ahmadinejad. How about short and ugly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful day. Am I right? ... It was so nice that the United Nations canceled its global warming conference and went to the beach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush addressed the general assembly at the U.N., and he was coolly received by a skeptical audience. Oh, I get that every night. Big deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was also at the U.N. summit. ... He did not speak. They just needed him to move a podium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush gave a major foreign policy speech in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations. That's right. Bush began his speech by saying, 'Greetings, foreign dudes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apple launched its iPhone in Europe. It's been a big success here,&quot; but it is being criticized in Europe &quot;because they say it's not European enough. Yeah, that's true. Apparently, the iPhone isn't European enough, because it actually works the entire month of August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president of Iran is in the United States. ... This guy is nuts. He denies the Holocaust happened. He says his country has no homosexuals. And he's looked very hard for them. He's even placed personal ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, maybe, if there were homosexuals in Iran, he would be better dressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this Saturday in Washington, D.C., they will hold the seventh annual National Book Festival. First lady Laura Bush will deliver a speech about the joy of reading. And then President Bush will give the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, it's official. Congress now has the lowest approval rating of any Congress in the history of the United States -- 11%. In fact,&quot; their &quot;approval rating is so low, today they are invited to speak at Columbia University.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Utah, polygamy sect leader Warren Jeffs has been convicted on two charges in&quot; a &quot;sex trial. ... He's going to prison, hopefully for the rest of his life. But the guy's got 80 wives,&quot; and &quot;when Rudy Giuliani heard that he said, 'Records are made to be broken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Advertisers...are going to put up giant billboards at the runway at LAX, next to the runways. So passengers sitting on planes...coming in off the runway can read them. ... They say it's a way to reach people who come to visit LA. You know, you want to reach millions of people who come to LA, put the signs up at the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, a couple of days ago at Columbia, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said there are no homosexuals in Iran. By the way, that's why in Iran it's nearly impossible to get your dog groomed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has a new plan to stop Iran's nuclear program. ... He's going to have O.J. steal the plutonium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the world leaders in town right now for the U.N. General Assembly. ... Yesterday, President Bush met with President Valdis Zatlers of Latvia, and President Festus Gontebanye Mogae of Botswana and President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania. Yeah, yeah. Or as Bush calls them, 'Buddy, Slim and Big Guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, controversial Iranian President Ahmadinejad insisted that Iran has freedom of the press. He says there are 30 newspapers published there that oppose his government. Yeah, so, if you are keeping track, that's 30 opposition newspapers and zero gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahmadinejad invited several high-profile reporters over to his hotel for dinner&quot; last night. Apparently, &quot;it went well, because this morning, Barbara Walters was seen leaving in the same clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The organizers of Hillary Clinton's campaign are sponsoring a contest where the winner gets to watch a Democratic debate while sitting next to Bill Clinton. ... The rules specify no members of the press and no fat chicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night was the premiere of the big show, 'Dancing Around the Issues,' otherwise known as the Democratic presidential debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, if you watched, the three Democratic frontrunners said last night -- this is what they said. Hillary and Barack and John Edwards, they said setting a timetable for a complete withdrawal is irresponsible, because you can't project what the future situation will be in Iraq. And pulling out troops basically depends on the situation on the ground -- otherwise known as 'the Bush plan.' Hello?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had to cancel his campaign appearance last week. He was...pretty sick. He was coughing up blue blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a speech in Maine, Rudy Giuliani talked about how he is a Yankee fan,&quot; yet &quot;he came out against illegal immigration. Make up your mind. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Arnold Schwarzenegger got together with Al Gore for a climate change summit. Now, even though he's a Republican and Al Gore is a Democrat, it's good they could talk, robot to...cyborg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush gave a speech urging Congress to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act. He's really for -- see, I think the reason President Bush is so adamant about this, I think he may have been left behind as a child himself. You know what I'm saying? Listen carefully to what he says here.&quot; President Bush: &quot;As yesterday's positive report card shows, childrens do learn when standards are high and the results are measured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was here, the president of Iran,&quot; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, &quot;he said there are no homosexuals in Iran. So what they're going to do now, they're going to develop one of their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. No gays in Iran. That is why you have to go all the way to Turkey for a facial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why you have to go to Jordan to look at drapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why you have to go to Syria to get a decent perm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why you have to go to Kuwait to see figure skating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night...was the eighth Democratic presidential debate. ... No, it was a kind of interesting debate, actually, last night. It was fascinating. Some political experts were shocked at how much the other Democratic candidates attacked Hillary Clinton during the debate. Yeah, they really went after her. Yeah. And even more shocking was when Bill Clinton yelled, 'Get her.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Bill Clinton, yesterday at a global conference on poverty and education, former President Bill Clinton met with actress Angelina Jolie. Yeah. Yeah, before the meeting, Clinton looked at himself in the mirror, took a deep breath and said, 'Bill, this is the moment you've been training for your whole life.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich said...he supports lowering the voting age to 16. Yeah. Not only that, Kucinich supports lowering the lever in the voting booth so he can reach it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in New York this week. Everyone was talking about his visit. Well, he just gave an interview. And Ahmadinejad summed himself up in four words, 'Love, justice, kindness and dignity.' Yeah. Then, he said, 'Wait, I'd like to add two more, anti-Semitic and windbreaker.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that before the U.S. invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein offered to leave the country and go into exile if he could take $1 billion with him. That's what he said. Yeah, it almost worked, but at the last minute, Howie Mandel convinced him to take the wrong suitcase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. Treasury is issuing a new $5 bill with a much larger, easy to read 5 on it. Yeah, yeah, thanks to the large print, the $5 bill will retain its status as the official birthday gift from old people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a...good one yesterday. He was at a school in New York...talking about his commitment to education.&quot; President Bush: &quot;As yesterday's positive report card shows, childrens do learn when standards are high and the results are measured.&quot; Kimmel: &quot;That's right. The childrens do ? it's part of the No Childs Left Behind Program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm starting to think he does these things on purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a debate between the Republican candidates for president in Baltimore tonight. The debate focused on minority issues and it was at Morgan State University, which is a black college. ... None of the top four Republican candidates were there. Giuliani, McCain, Romney and Thompson, not one of them showed up. Apparently, they all had scheduling conflicts that prevented them are going to place where no one will vote for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting, according to a report from a British website, Saddam Hussein offered to step down and go into exile one month before the invasion of Iraq in return for $1 billion. Yeah. He said he would go into exile for $1 billion. That's the same deal NBC offered me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the president of Iran was the laughingstock of the world this week when he said, 'There are no homosexuals in Iran.' In fact, when he got on his Iranian Airways jet to fly back home, the male flight attendant didn't speak to him the whole way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an upcoming interview in the gay magazine 'The Advocate.' Hillary Clinton says the rumors about her being a lesbian are not true. And she says she has never had sex with a woman, no matter how many times Bill has begged her to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congress has been having hearings this week concerning the increasing number of late airline flights. They may even...have to intervene in order to help the airlines improve. And really, who better than Congress to show you how to make your business run more efficiently? Really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and last night -- last night, PBS host Tavis Smiley -- he was the moderator at the Republican debate on minority issues at Morgan State University. But not one of the four leading Republican candidates, Giuliani, Thompson, McCain or Romney, not one showed up for the debate on black issues. Now, how are you going to going to stand up to terrorists when you're afraid of a guy named Tavis Smiley?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway -- this is kind of interesting. In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Rudy Giuliani said he is guided by Jesus and the Bible and he doesn't want people to judge his private life. He then said, 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.' And then Mitt Romney hit him in the head with a rock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has just invited President Bush to visit Iran and speak at an Iranian university. ... After receiving the invitation, President Bush said, 'Maybe I'll come when you guys play Notre Dame.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Ahmadinejad ? it's been reported that when he was a child, he changed his name, which means Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not his real name. Yeah. Even more shocking, it turns out he was born Stephanie del Gado.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an interesting story -- it turns out that before the U.S. Invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein said he would quit the presidency and leave the country if he were given $1 billion. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, President Bush said, 'Hell, I'll do it for $10,000.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Israeli police announced this week that they will no longer arrest first-time drug users. ... When he heard this, Snoop Dogg said, 'Shalom.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, speaking of drugs, economists are saying that the high value of the Canadian dollar has hurt that country's sale of marijuana to the United States. Yeah, because the first two questions any pothead asks are, 'Can I buy some pot?' and 'What's the Canadian dollar trading at?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed $5,000 be given to every baby in America at birth. ... And, today, Barack Obama topped that with $6,000 and a year's supply of Turtle Wax.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want to give $5,000 to every baby. I don't know. I am so sick of these babies with their hands out all the time. 'Give me, give me, give me, give me.' Like, 'Wah, wah, wah.' When are they just going to shut up, these babies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Iranian President, Mahmoud I'm A Nut Job, says that ? isn't that his name? He said he thinks the speech at Columbia University was a huge success. And he thinks the American people thought so, too. Yeah, he said a number of Americans told him they want him to speak at Florida University. See, something got lost in the translation. Apparently, he doesn't realize 'FU' does not mean Florida University.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, after...he left the United States last week, the Iranian president met with the president of Venezuela. You know, if we could have gotten Kim Jong-Il down there, we could have had the first nut ball trifecta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this is pretty scary. A pro-terrorist website has posted a series of video links to teach everyday people how to fly a 747, which on one hand can be pretty scary. On the other hand, that could be pretty useful next time you're sitting on the tarmac in a JetBlue plane that won't take off. 'Give me those controls!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company that makes ground beef over there in New Jersey recalled 300,000 pounds of ground beef. ... Here is what they are going to do. They're going to mix it with lead paint and turn it into Chinese food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here's good news. George W. Bush says that he is committed to fighting global warming. Yeah, well he nipped that in the bud, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, President Bush says he's really going to buckle down now and fight global warming. As a matter of fact, he announced he is sending 20,000 troops to the sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the...New York Mets failed to make the playoffs. Yeah, after one of the worst collapses in baseball history. Yeah, yeah. Historic, yeah. People were so upset, apparently, half the team has been deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll of Democratic voters in Iowa has found that senior citizens prefer Hillary Clinton. ... Unfortunately for Hillary, the seniors still rank her third behind applesauce and creamed spinach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first day American citizens are required to have a passport if they want to get into Mexico. It's a new rule. You have to have a passport to get into Mexico. Previously, all you needed to get into a Mexico was a hankering for diarrhea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Co-star in a movie with a monkey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is now saying that there's a good chance we'll be bombing Iran,&quot; because &quot;he is convinced that they have nuclear weapons. Well, he would know. He's been pretty good about that kind of thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is good news. President Bush says he's going to take action now on global warming,&quot; because &quot;he became very alarmed when another chunk of ice broke off his mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And recently, Hillary Clinton was asked what role her husband, Bill, would play if she becomes president. And Hillary said Bill would be sent around the world as a roving ambassador. Gee, I wonder which one of them came up with that idea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'The Wall Street Journal,' you probably heard about this, is reporting that Rudy Giuliani has taken cell phone calls from his wife over 40 times during speeches. ... And each time, it was a different wife calling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI is concerned that the mafia may go into business with Al Qaeda. That's scary, isn't it? The Mafia with Al Qaeda, ooh? Wake up, find a goat head in your bed, that would be awful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they made Al Qaeda an offer they couldn't refuse, 72 hookers in this life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the weak dollar, foreign companies are buying American companies at a record pace.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, big landslide in San Diego, did you see that? Man, see, I don't think President Bush understands the situation. Like, today, he said, 'It's good to see houses moving again.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And hybrid cars are now coming under fire from blind groups because they make so little noise at slow speeds, it's hard for blind people to determine when it's safe to cross the street.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is how they break that down -- $30 million for advertising, $50 million for pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, political insiders are speculating that if Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, she may choose a Hispanic running mate. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard about this, Bill Clinton yelled, 'How about Salma Hayek?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iraqi government has ordered $100 million worth of weapons made in China. Yeah. Yeah, an Iraqi official said we're hoping China makes weapons that are half as deadly as their toys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, a spokesman for John Edwards is accusing Barack Obama of stealing John Edwards' ideas. See, apparently...Obama has this secret plan to slip into third place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Barack Obama announced he's flying back home to Chicago to have a hot 15th wedding anniversary date with his wife. You know, every candidate celebrates their anniversary differently, of course. Giuliani, he spends his trying to remember which wife he's married to. Hillary Clinton spends her wedding, you know, trying to track down where Bill is. Of course, Fred Thompson spends his anniversary helping his young wife with her homework.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain reported $6 million in new campaign contributions in the last quarter. It seemed like good news to him until he realized it was one of those fake checks you get in the mail. You know, from those people who prey on the elderly? Yeah. Not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush reiterated today that that his Administration does not torture people. He said more pain and suffering has been inflicted on people by Danny Bonaduce than his Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what the I.N.S. Is calling the largest sweep of its kind ever, agents arrested 1,300 immigrants in L.A. and deported 600 of them. You know, I wondered why I couldn't find a clerk at Wal-Mart today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, border patrol agents in San Diego and Tucson are getting these powerful compressed air guns and they fire pepper balls at illegal border crossers. ... If that doesn't work, then they bring in the salad shooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over 500,000 toys made in China are being recalled because they posed a health hazard. The most dangerous toy, the one you want to look out for, the lead paint-tipped lawn darts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chicago Cubs were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Do you realize that Arizona wasn't even a state the last time the Cubs were in the World Series? To give you an idea how long ago it was, Fred Thompson was still married to his first wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today is Columbus Day. ... Or as Native Americans call it, Illegal Immigration Day. We are the first illegals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the U.S. military is now targeting Al Qaeda's internet capabilities. Apparently, Al Qaeda's always trying to recruit new members on the internet. They hook up on something called jihadharmony.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over a million Boy Scout badges made in China have been recalled because they have lead in them. What is this, like the 8,000th product from China to have lead in it? How much lead do the Chinese people have? Shouldn't they have run out of it? Why don't they just sell lead? Wouldn't that be easier. Then people would be like, 'Oh, there's some paint in my lead!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, you know...what the number one band is in China? Led Zeppelin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Happy Columbus Day, ladies and gentlemen. As you know, the day we honor President Columbus. ... Hillary Clinton says although she supported Columbus going into America, she didn't have any idea he would stay indefinitely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they were celebrating Columbus Day down in Washington, D.C. and President Bush was apparently a little confused. Earlier today, he pardoned a lasagna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is now reaching out to different cultures, which, I think, is a good thing. I don't know if you heard about this, but last night President Bush had dinner with a group of Muslims at the White House, and he quoted the Prophet Mohammed. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good thing, yeah. But there was an awkward moment when Bush referred to Mohammed as the greatest boxer of all time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey just came out. Check this out. It found that the country with the highest number of contented citizens in the world is Mexico. ... Yeah, apparently this is because everyone who was unhappy in Mexico has already moved to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a recent speech, President Bush said, this is a quote, 'My job is a decision making job. As a result, I have made a lot of decisions.' Apparently, Bush's decision that day was to write his own speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson is being criticized for being out of touch because in a recent interview, he talked about strengthening our relationship with the Soviet Union, which, of course, no longer exists. Yeah. Yeah, Thompson says he feels bad about the mistake and he plans to personally apologize to Stalin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Republicans had another big presidential debate earlier today on CNBC. ... It's like NBC, but with even less viewers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, all of the big-name Republican candidates were there. The old guy was there, the really old guy was there, and the really, really old guy was there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see them lined up? It looked like a pack of vanilla wafers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attack of the white guys. I was waiting for a hockey game to break out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this was Fred Thompson's first debate. Remember Fred Thompson from the show 'Law &amp; Order'? Also Rudy Giuliani. Remember him from the TV show 'Cheaters'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big night for Fred. His wife wanted to watch, but you know Fred's rules. No TV on a school night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it's funny. After the debate -- we watched the debate, and they go into these spin rooms, and all of the campaign people from the various campaigns, they all say how their candidates won. Like Fred Thompson's people say he won because he didn't fall asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's campaign said he won because he had two positions on every issue, unlike the other people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rudy's campaign said he won because he lasted the entire time without one cell phone call from his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hybrid vehicles are so quiet at slow speeds that blind people say they're a safety risk. Again, there's another issue I don't think President Bush understands. Like today Bush said, 'Maybe blind people shouldn't be driving them.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems an Iranian-born German soccer star is refusing to play in his team's next match because it's in Israel. He's German and Iranian. There's a good combination, huh? One side of the family caused the Holocaust. The other side denies it even happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'Forbes' magazine, the richest person in China is a 26-year- old woman. You know what she does? Sells lead paint. Makes a fortune. Puts it in toys, games, potato chips. It's in everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Answers To The Question &quot;How Hot Is It?&quot;: 3. &quot;It's so hot, Al Gore says civilization will be destroyed in our lifetime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight's Republican debate will be the first one that former Senator Fred Thompson will attend. Yeah. Thompson says he wanted to attend the previous debates, but he got stuck driving his wife to cheerleading practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study...says that more than 10,000 Cubans a year are entering the United States by going to Mexico and then crossing the border. Yeah. U.S. border agents are furious because the Cubans are stealing jobs that should go to Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, there was another Republican debate. How many watched the Republican debate yesterday? How many watched 'Dancing with the Stars'? Once again, you get the government you deserve.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, that's pathetic when more people are debating than actually watching the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this was the first one Fred Thompson took part in. See, I think it's good to throw another rich white guy in there, mix it up a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Thompson felt right at home. You know, the ratings for the debate were so low, it's like he never left NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, there were...times when Fred Thompson looked like a bystander, you know, and Romney and Giuliani were going at each other. See, I don't think Fred understands how these debates work. Like, he went backstage and asked the producers, 'I need more lines.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fred Thompson is also being criticized for being out of touch because in a recent interview, he referred to Russia as the Soviet Union. ... But Thompson is brushing off his criticism. He says he's now focusing all his attention on America's role in the League of Nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest poll, New Hampshire...voters, kind of prickly voters, are unexpectedly warming to Hillary Clinton. So this could be the first proof we have of global warming -- Hillary thawing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton announced this week she has dropped her plan to give $5,000 to every baby born in America. ... Apparently what happened was they did a test where they gave $5,000 to 100 babies -- kids immediately became Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton now saying she's having second thoughts about the NAFTA agreement, you know, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which her husband supported and signed into law when he was president. See, and this is why it's controversial. The last time Bill and Hillary had completely different interpretations of a legal document, I guess it was their marriage license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush says these rumors that he's just getting ready to attack Iran are propaganda. He said he and Cheney were ready months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises In Yesterday's Republican Debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. McCain answered all questions with his sock puppet friend 'Carl'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Debate was held at Chi-Chi's in Dearborn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The part where Giuliani slugged an audience member was odd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Mitt Romney proposed a big tax cut for guys named 'Mitt' -- now that's crazy ? who's ever heard of such a thing like that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Candidates greeted each other with a long, passionate kiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No number 5 ? writer seeing hilarious remake of 'The Heartbreak Kid', in theaters now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tom Tancredo admitted even he doesn't know who the hell he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Eddie Brill claimed the audience was one-third foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Wayne Newton was voted off.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Republican debate last night? ... The whole thing was late. If you saw it, it was late getting started. They had to go through the bags under Fred Thompson's eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here is what I don't understand. Rudy Giuliani had three wives and he's not the Mormon candidate. Is that right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of President Bush's closest advisers said that Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is going to have trouble getting elected because his last name is Huckabee. That's what he said, yeah. He said the only way it could be worse is if his name was George W. Huckabee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former 'Law &amp; Order' star Fred Thompson appeared in his first presidential debate last night. Political experts called him uneven, flat and dull. In other words, Thompson was the highlight of the debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dennis Kucinich has asked that his name be taken off the ballot in the Michigan Democratic primary. Yeah. Yeah, Michigan voting officials told Kucinich, 'How about we just put it up high where you can't see it?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Radar' magazine is causing a big controversy because the cover of their November issue features a doctored photo of a partially-dressed Rudy Giuliani and a totally nude Hillary Clinton. 'Radar' says it's all part of their plan to sell zero magazines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe it or not, there was another presidential debate yesterday and it was a Republican debate held in Dearborn, Michigan. It was 'Law &amp; Order' star Fred Thompson's first presidential debate. The addition of Fred Thompson has given them exactly what they needed -- another old white guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey guys, we're learning more and more information about that Republican debate the other night. ... Well, the big story is that Mitt Romney went after Rudolph Giuliani. You probably saw that. He kept criticizing. In fact, Romney criticized Giuliani so much Rudy made him an honorary ex-wife.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. Mitt Romney said the other night at the debates that he's the one of all the candidates who is the most optimistic about the future. Well, there's a shock. Rich white guy with $200 million. What is he so happy about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's name was mentioned 12 times the other night -- 12 times. And of course, Hillary was stunned. She's not used to guys yelling out her name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know whose wedding anniversary is today? The Clintons. Their 32nd wedding anniversary. Happy anniversary to them. Actually, Hillary's been married 32 years. Bill's been married for about three years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is kind of scary. Out on the campaign trail in Iowa, a van carrying Barack Obama's wife was hit by a guy on a motorcycle. Boom! The guy plows into the side of the van. You know, we've got to teach George Clooney how to ride a bike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican presidential candidate Sam Brownback said today he will drop out of the race if he doesn't finish at least fourth in the Iowa caucuses. Fourth. You have to admire a guy who is aiming that high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fourth. Well, if he doesn't become president he can always run NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turkey has recalled their ambassador to the U.S. over a big political dispute. And again, President Bush doesn't understand these issues. Today, he said he's worried this dispute could linger over Thanksgiving and then, no turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Taco Bell has opened a restaurant in Mexico. Taco Bell in Mexico City. Imagine that. Is that a good idea? We need to give Mexican people another reason to flee their country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Starbucks announced this week they're recalling 250,000 plastic cups made in China, because they tend to break and are a choking hazard. Today, China said, 'See, this is why we make everything out of lead. It doesn't break.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the White House spokesman said President Bush is very happy Al Gore won. Not Dick Cheney. Oh, no. Dick Cheney said today now he wants to bomb Norway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, a lot of people are wondering if Al Gore will run for president which would make it a what, Al Gore versus Hillary Democratic primary? Kind of global warming versus global cooling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And California has just passed a law that bans smoking in cars, if you have children in the car. If there are children in the car, you cannot smoke. Yeah. And today Britney Spears said, 'Woo! Got rid of those kids just in time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, President Bush said that Congress needs to give him more power to spy on Americans by making changes to the Protect America Act. You ever notice he always gives these pieces of legislation names that you can't disagree with? ... How do you argue with the Protect America Act? Give it a fair name. At least call it the Ignore The Constitution Act. Then you can argue about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...the Taco Bell restaurant chain about to open in Mexico City. And today, the government in Mexico called it a hate crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Mexican officials are against opening Taco Bells down there. They say it insults the Mexican culture. And today the folks at Taco Bell Said, 'Hey, if they don't like it they can go back home to L.A.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a British artificial intelligence researcher was awarded a doctorate for a paper he just published. This is very heavy material.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they're saying that now that he's won the Nobel Prize, Al Gore has a huge international platform to fight global warming. You know. It's kind of sad, today he stepped onto the platform and it collapsed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She raised $35 million in three months. That's the most money ever raised by a woman. If you don't count what Oprah has made since lunch, because that's a whole different deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Vice President Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne Cheney, said that Barack Obama and Dick Cheney are related. She said they're actually eighth cousins. No, this is true. Lynne Cheney said that Obama and Dick Cheney's connection was the result of one of Obama's ancestors marrying one of Cheney's ancestors in 1650. Even more interesting -- you know who introduced them in 1650? Bob Dole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney and Obama related? Do you realize Dick Cheney now has more blacks and gays in his own family than in the entire Republican Party?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you'd like to find out if you're related to Dick Cheney, very simple test, here's what you do. You go out to a shooting range. If you can't tell the difference between a lawyer and a quail, you could be related.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush met with the Dalai Lama yesterday. ... It was a good meeting. The Dalai Lama taught President Bush how to meditate. And President Bush taught the Dalai Lama how to just nod off at meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I don't think President Bush really understands who the Dalai Lama is. Yeah, yeah. Like, he said he was disappointed he couldn't get the Dalai Lama to do the snatch the pebble from my hand, Grasshopper trick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton was on 'The View' the other day. She was asking Barbara Walters for advice. A lot of people don't know this,&quot; but &quot;Barbara Walters was very instrumental in helping to elect William Howard Taft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...Republican front-runner Rudy Giuliani says he's going to try and follow Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment, that a Republican should never attack another Republican. ... Let's hope he has better luck with 11th Commandment than he did with the Seventh Commandment. Wasn't that the...adultery one?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to three people this week. It went to the CEOs of Exxon, Texaco and Shell for figuring out how to quadruple the price of oil over a seven-year period without any actual shortage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big drug bust at JFK International Airport in New York yesterday. Ten employees arrested for smuggling cocaine and heroin inside passengers' luggage. They'd put the drugs in people's bags and then take them out when the luggage reached its destination. Imagine that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? Turns out that Dick Cheney and Obama are cousins. ... Strange, isn't it? In a related story, 20 years ago, turns out Rudy Giuliani was briefly married to himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, yes. Obama and Cheney are actually cousins, but Barack did not inherit the family sneer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush had a historic meeting with the Dalai Lama. ... Yeah, there was an awkward moment when Bush saw what the Dalai Lama was wearing and said, 'Don't tell me they lost your luggage.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts were worried about China's reaction to President Bush's meeting with the Dalai Lama.

Then Bush said, 'But this might,' and took a huge bite out of a panda bear sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Cheney's wife said that Vice President Cheney and Barack Obama are actually distant cousins. That's what she said, yeah. Yeah, when Dick Cheney found out, he said, 'I knew there was something creepy about that guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dalai Lama is here in the United States this week. This morning, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions to peace, non-violence, human rights and religious understanding. Unfortunately, just a few short hours after the ceremony, the Lama was stripped of his medal after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the Dalai Lama had a private meeting with President Bush. You know, the last Dolly the President greeted at the White House met was Parton. So this was different for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe it or not, they have a lot in common, because one of the goals of Zen Buddhism is to completely empty your mind. And, you know, the President did that years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else happened this week? Oh, President Bush met with the Dalai Lama at the White House. One kind of awkward moment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was given the -- what is it? The Medal of Freedom? Is that what he was given? As you know, the Dalai Lama does not engage in sex, drugs, alcohol or tobacco, which raises the question, what was Congress honoring him for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Dalai Lama told President Bush that he had seen evil firsthand. And President Bush said, 'Great, you got to meet Vice President Cheney.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, China was not happy with the U.S. honoring the Dalai Lama. They were very upset about it. In fact, listen to this, China is so angry they're threatening to quit pirating our movies and DVDs for an entire week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican Senator Sam Brownback's campaign announced he will drop out of the presidential race tomorrow. ... Now the hard part, of course,&quot; will be &quot;breaking the news to his supporter. That's going to be tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, you know, the writing was on the wall. I mean, you knew this was going to happen. Like at the last presidential debate, the only question he got was, 'I'm sorry, what's your name again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a new report,&quot; security screeners &quot;at our nation's airport...failed to find fake bombs&quot; hidden by undercover agents &quot;60% of the time. Undercover agents that had fake bombs on them, 60% of the time,&quot; the screeners &quot;didn't find them. And President Bush said today, 'Well, who cares about fake bombs?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. France's new president, Nicolas Sarkozy,&quot; and &quot;his wife have separated. ... The rumor is that he stayed in the marriage for political gain and had planned to get a divorce right after being elected president. To which Hillary Clinton said, 'So?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess what happened was&quot; Sarkozy's &quot;wife came home early one night, and caught the French president surrendering to a German woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember...baby Jessica? The little baby that was rescued after falling in the well. ... She's almost 21 now and will soon be getting a million dollars from the fund set up with donations when she fell down the well.&quot; And &quot;in a related story, earlier today, Senator John McCain threw himself down a well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something odd that we heard about just a couple of days ago. Turns out that Barack Obama and Vice President Dick Cheney are cousins. Did you hear this? Honest to God, imagine how terrible it would be to find out that you are related to a cranky old guy. I mean, just ask my son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now Lynne Cheney, Dick Cheney's wife, is getting all wound up. She says she would be uncomfortable with Hillary Clinton running the country. Lynne is uncomfortable with Hillary? And Bill said, 'Join the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a speech at the Capitol yesterday, the Dalai Lama, who's visiting&quot; right now &quot;admitted that his English language skills equal those of a kindergartener's. ... When he said this, President Bush said, 'No one likes a showoff.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week -- this is a weird story -- Vice President Cheney's wife said that Vice President Cheney is actually a distant cousin of Barack Obama. ... At first, Obama was skeptical. Then he remembered that his great-great grandmother once had a demon out of wedlock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich caused some trouble this week because he was campaigning in Red Sox territory while wearing a Cleveland Indians hat. Yeah. Apparently, someone walked up to Kucinich's wife and said, 'Tell your son to take off that baseball hat.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's happening in Las Vegas with magician David Cop-a-feel. You heard about this? Well, apparently I guess the FBI is investigating the magician David Copperfield for possible sexual misconduct against a woman. And today, fellow magicians Siegfried and Roy were horrified. They said, 'A woman?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI, boy, they didn't mess around. This was a big deal. I understand they cuffed him; they put him in a straight jacket and suspended him upside down in a tank of water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the FBI takes a magician like David Copperfield into custody and they question him, do you think they ask him things like -- That trick with the rings, how do they come apart? Just curious. We'll let you go if you just tell us that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news today for Barack Obama. You hear what happened? Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah. He just found out he's related to Bill O'Reilly, too. The guy can't get a break!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Dow Jones lost almost 400 points today. ... Isn't that unbelievable? Giving up almost 400 points in one day. That's almost as bad as Notre Dame's defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new study says that screeners at L.A. International Airport&quot; missed &quot;75% of the fake bombs that were sent through the lines. It's unbelievable. However, they did confiscate 100% of people's water bottles. So you have to go buy a new one at the airport gift shop for five bucks a piece. They did get that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you read about these marijuana forests they have in Afghanistan? The forests have 10-foot high marijuana plants that are so thick, no vehicle can get through there. You thought a lot of musicians were involved in saving the rainforest.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, by the way, congratulations to Al Gore for winning the Nobel Peace Prize. I thought this was sad. Al had the Nobel Peace Prize Less than a week, and O.J. broke in and stole it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the 12th International Clown Convention is being held in Mexico City. ... Yeah. Apparently, the Mexican clowns' most popular routine is stuffing 30 clowns in the trunk of a car and heading north to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, FBI agents raided a Las Vegas warehouse owned by magician David Copperfield, and they seized nearly $2 million in cash. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FEMA has apologized for staging a fake news conference on the California wildfires. Did you hear about that? They had a fake news conference in which FEMA employees pretended to be reporters and asked softball questions to their idiot boss, a guy named Harvey Johnson. Yeah. Isn't this unbelievable? See, it was obvious the reporters were FEMA workers because the questions were about the 2003 fires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Senator Brownback has dropped out of the presidential race. He says he wants to spend more time with his family. Apparently they're not really sure who he is either.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his wife have gotten a divorce. Apparently, there were rumors of infidelity and lack of trust, to which Hillary and Bill Clinton said, 'What? That's no reason to get divorced!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And David Copperfield planning his next big stunt -- escape from San Quentin, I believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, last week, the FBI raided his warehouse. But apparently, most of his memorabilia had already been stolen by O.J.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It came out last week that O.J. Simpson owes the state of California $1.4 million in taxes. Yeah. You know something? I don't think the Governor should force O.J. to pay taxes. You know what we should do? Use O.J. to collect taxes. Think about this. He bursts into some business with his friends with guns, we'd have the money like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought this day would never come but guess what, ladies and gentlemen, he's at it again. Good for him. Vice President Dick Cheney is pheasant hunting again in upstate New York. The hunt went pretty well. Dick drove back to the hotel with a hunting buddy tied to his fender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we made a lot of jokes about Dick Cheney and hunting and shooting his buddies in the face. But he...really is a great sportsman. I mean, before he shoots the pheasant, he makes it dig its own grave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Argentina's first lady was elected as the new president of Argentina, which makes the former president the new first spouse. Yeah. Yeah, or as President Bill Clinton calls him, 'my future wing man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich says that he once had an encounter with a UFO. ... Apparently several weird-looking little men got off the ship, saw Kucinich, and said, 'It's all right, he's one of us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday on '60 Minutes,'&quot; French President Nicolas Sarkozy &quot;got up and left in the middle of an interview. Just got up and stormed out, yeah. Citizens of France say their president acted rudely and they've never been prouder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new 'GQ' interview that just came out, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said, and this is a quote, 'Marijuana is not a drug.' ... When he heard this, Snoop Dogg said, 'If it's not a drug, then I've been wasting a lot of time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our new Democratic Congress. Remember they promised longer workweeks? ... Well, now they announce they're going to a four-day workweek. I guess they realize they don't need a full five days to do nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in a little hot water after saying in an interview that marijuana is 'not a drug. It is a leaf, it is a plant.' And today's approval rating in California -- 99.9%.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Has everyone updated their will?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'The crisp air is giving me goose bumps -- no, wait, it's another heart attack.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'My pacemaker also makes bird calls.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'This can't end well.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'I want that quail taken alive ? let's find out what the son of a bitch knows.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'Bush was supposed to come, but his father got him out of it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'Condi, grab a shotgun and go get yourself a man.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No number 3 -- writers making picket signs for upcoming strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'You shoot one old guy in the face, avoid talking to authorities, delay taking a blood-alcohol test and you're labeled a bad guy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Duck!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview that just came out, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said -- this is his quote ? 'cannabis is not a drug.' ... Of course, when Arnold said it, it sounded like, 'Cannibals need a hug.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidential candidate Bill Richardson has called on his opponents to end all negative campaigning. Yeah. When they heard this, all of the other candidates rolled their eyes and said, 'Whatever you say, fat boy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama doing everything he can to get ahead. Sources in Barack Obama's campaign say that Obama has been watching old tapes of Bill Clinton to improve his style. Yeah. Yeah, which explains why Obama now starts every sentence with, 'Honey, I can explain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well yesterday in upstate New York, kind of unbelievable, Vice President Dick Cheney went pheasant hunting. He's hunting again. ... Yeah. This time, just to be on the safe side, as his hunting partner, Cheney chose a pheasant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big debate tonight with the Democratic candidates for president. Reports say Barack Obama prepared for the debate by studying Bill Clinton's techniques. I guess that would explain why he wasn't wearing any pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wasn't a very good day for Hillary Clinton. She was criticized by Mitt Romney. He said she had no experience, called her an intern. ... Ridiculous. If Hillary was an intern, Bill would be sleeping with her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is getting a lot of attention these days. The British edition of 'GQ' reported yesterday that the Governator said that marijuana is not a drug, it's a leaf. Of course, his spokesman said the Governor was joking when he made the statement and also he was probably high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another -- I think, the 75th debate tonight. The Democrats got together in Philadelphia, at Drexler University. There was a lot of anticipation going in because Barack Obama, who's a distant second, promised to go after Hillary Clinton. He started the debate in a strange way. He punched her in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Dick Cheney had an awkward moment tonight at the White House Halloween party. He went dressed as Darth Vader. And at the party, he ran into the real Darth Vader, who was dressed as Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was another big Democratic debate last night in Philadelphia. Seven candidates on stage debating. Seven, which, sadly, for Joe Biden, is the biggest crowd he's ever drawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like oil may soon hit $100 a barrel. Oh, yeah. Today, President Bush said, 'Well, how much without the barrel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh! And in his latest rantings, Osama bin Laden is now calling for his followers to avoid extremism. Oh, yeah, the last thing you want from a suicide bomber is some kind of radical wacko.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President of Indonesia has released his first music album. ... It's called 'My Longing For You.' He actually wrote the songs and performed them. And now, President Bush is also putting his own album. It's called 'I Sing Gooder Than Him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Associated Press, doctors are now experimenting with hot sauces like chili pepper...to be used as a numbing agent during painful surgeries. That's a bad HMO, isn't it, huh? You go in to get your gall bladder removed and they send you down to Baja Fresh first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh! And Rolling Stone's guitarist Ron Wood says in his new autobiography he was snorting so much cocaine, at one time Keith Richards actually pulled a gun on him to get him to stop. ... The thing Ron doesn't understand is that wasn't an intervention. That was a robbery, okay? Keith was trying to get your cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN's Anderson Cooper&quot; revealed &quot;this week...that he was tested for environmental poisons. And they found over 100 synthetic chemicals in his body. That beats Courtney Love's old record.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Domino's pizza said they delivered more than 1 million pizzas last night, nearly a 50% increase over a typical Wednesday. See, this is how you know Americans are getting too fat,&quot; when &quot;we can't hand out chocolate and candy without eating pizza at the same time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what holiday it was in Mexico today? They celebrated the...Day of the Dead. Yeah, where departed souls are remembered, who are currently in Los Angeles.&quot; They &quot;have departed Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And tensions are very high between Iraq and Turkey. You see, this is where President Bush, I don't think he understands these issues, you know? Like today, he warned the American people we could be in for a rough Thanksgiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has a new platform -- 'live long and prosper,' I believe it would be. Did you hear about this? Dennis Kucinich admitted during the debates the other night that he had seen a UFO up close. See, Dennis Kucinich doesn't seem like a guy that would see a UFO. He's like the kind of guy you'd see coming out of a UFO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's meltdown during the debates the other night continues to be the big story. Even Bill Clinton said it was Hillary's worst performance since their honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China announced this week they're going to build a research center to study hybrid technology. They want to build their own hybrid car. It's a car that runs half on gas and half on child slave labor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Democratic debate last night on television? Tough night for candidate Bill Richardson. During the entire debate the only question Tim Russert asked him was, 'And you are? And your name is?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Dennis Kucinich?&quot; During &quot;the debate he claimed he once saw a UFO. ... Not only that, he claims aliens introduced him to his hot wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Dennis Kucinich says he once saw a UFO,&quot; and &quot;I'm thinking to myself, saw one? My God, he looks like he's been riding one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts are criticizing Senator Hillary Clinton's performance during the debate this week, calling it her worst performance of the year. Yeah. Yeah, after hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'That's what you think.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Child labor activists are protesting the Gap. They're protesting the Gap because there are clothes being sold there that are made by kids. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, don't forget, you turn your clock back an hour this weekend. You get an extra hour of sleep. Kind of like watching a Fred Thompson speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody knows that daylight savings, that the change is later this year. It was supposed to be last week. According to The New York Times, Congress made this decision in part from pressure from the candy lobby, who wanted an extra hour of daylight for trick-or-treating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that unbelievable? I mean, the research lobby can't get stem-cell research through. Consumer safety lobby can't get lead out of toys.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karen Hughes, a former advisor to President Bush, is leaving the State Department after working the last two years trying to improve the rest of the world's opinion of America. Well, congratulations on a job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. Time to bring out that 'mission accomplished' sign again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush said the Iraqis are taking back Iraq. Then Dick Cheney said, 'But not the oil, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting. Military experts say the companies are very close now to developing technologies that can make tanks invisible. Invisible tanks. Don't we have enough defense contractors ripping off America as it is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's kind of like when they start charging us for invisible tanks. 'You owe us $10 billion.' 'Well, where are the tanks?' 'Um -- right there!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the FAA revealed that on a recent red eye flight from Baltimore to Denver, the pilot was asleep as the plane approached the runway, and only woke up when someone yelled at him over the radio. Isn't that unbelievable? You know what we should do? Make the pilots sit in the same seats we have to sit in, okay? There is no chance they will nod off during the flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and...in just one month, Don Imus will return to radio in New York City. I don't think Don learned his lesson. No, no. Did you see who his new on-air partner is? Dog the Bounty Hunter. Yeah, not good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they developed a tank that uses cameras and they project an image on to an object to create the illusion of invisibility. The first applications are military, but some day they're saying that the technology could be used for important civilian purposes, like making Star Jones disappear, for instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee&quot; has &quot;reached what they call the top tier of GOP candidates. The top tier. That means during the debates, he no longer has to wear the name tag.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know...spend an average of $200 per vote in Iowa. ... How many would rather have the cash? Yeah, exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I always love when they campaign because you always see the candidates holding up ears of corn&quot; because &quot;that's what they grow in Iowa. ... See, how come they don't do that when they come to L.A.? Like, you don't see the candidates on Hollywood Boulevard, arm around a hooker, big vial of crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what I love? To connect with voters, they always try to do something gimmicky. Like, they always like to spend one night in an Iowa farmhouse, each one of the candidates. They pick a family, an Iowa farmer, and they spend the night in the Iowa farm. You know, [Bill] Clinton did that in '92. But as I remember, the farmer was out of town -- the farmer's daughter was home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something. We don't know the results, so I'm just going by the polls in the paper this morning. But Fred Thompson. What happened to him? Oh, my God. He's doing so badly, it's like he's back here on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, well, folks,&quot; 2007 has &quot;been declared one of the hottest years on record, to which Al Gore went ? 'Yes! I mean, Ooh! That's awful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Writers Guild strike does continue. ... Let me simply this for you. Here's what the writer want. Tell me if you don't think this is fair. They want a share of internet revenues and four more years of President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there are caucuses today in Iowa. Caucusing. Isn't that what got Bill Clinton impeached?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, which really is amazing because...this is Iowa. There are more black people in the Beatles than in Iowa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Barack Obama, the big winner of the Democratic caucus in Iowa. It's pretty amazing. Stunning victory. He got 57% of the youth vote, 35% of the female vote, and 100% of Iowa's black vote, a guy named Larry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to Mike Huckabee. He was a big winner on the Republican side. ... Isn't it amazing, the impact of just one appearance on 'The Tonight Show'? See that? Tuesday, he was unknown, boom, the next day!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton came in third,&quot; so &quot;apparently, she picked the wrong late-night talk show to do the other night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Hillary Clinton soundly beaten by both Barack Obama and John Edwards, or, as she's now calling it, 'a vast left wing conspiracy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was watching MSNBC and all the pundits, and one of Hillary Clinton's campaign people, said that last night's defeat was just 'a bump in the road.' ... Kind of like the scene in the 'Titanic' when the guy goes 'What was that?' 'Oh, just an iceberg.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Chris Dodd dropped out of the presidential race after Iowa.&quot; Dodd &quot;got 0% of the vote. In fact, did you know the Secret Service turned down Senator Dodd for secret service protection? On the grounds that nobody could have picked him out of a crowd anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have heard, earlier this week the price of oil closed at $100 a barrel. You see, I don't think President Bush understands this issue. In fact, when they asked him what effect this would have on average Americans, President Bush said it wouldn't have much effect at all&quot; because &quot;most Americans buy their oil in little cans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a new Japanese government report says that Japan could have nuclear weapons within three to five years. And the report also says that the Japanese nuclear weapons would be similar to American nuclear weapons, but smaller and more fuel efficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Many of your supporters have been hospitalized because you ordered your campaign buttons from China.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the Iowa caucus over, Bill Clinton is hitting the campaign trail for his wife. He...said, 'There's two things I want to say about Hillary. First, I'd still vote for her even if we never married. And -- sorry, I forgot the second thing. I'm thinking about if we never married.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, of course, the big winner in Iowa. He's expected to do very well tomorrow in New Hampshire also. You know, let me ask you something, though. Isn't it about time reporters stop asking that stupid question ? 'Do you think America is ready for a black president?' Like he's going to go, 'D'oh, you got me!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's campaign staff said, in the news yesterday, that losing in Iowa was not a problem because getting beat will make us a better team. Oh, yeah. Certainly worked for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Candidates always like to say...they're going to get tough on career criminals, Republicans especially. ... What other kind of criminal is there, really?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so warm today, I saw a writer fanning himself with his picket sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you folks see the debates in New Hampshire over the weekend? Oh my God, dull. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how the government keeps telling us how the weather affects gasoline prices. For example, when the weather was rainy and cold, well, it takes more fuel to heat our homes. So of course the price of oil goes up.&quot; Then &quot;when it's sunny out, well, we take more vacations. We drive around. The price of oil goes up. ... In fact, the only time weather makes the price go down, I believe, is when it snows in hell.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a scary incident in the Straits of Hormuz this week&quot; where &quot;those Iranian boats threatened our Navy?&quot; President Bush &quot;said today he has no plans to attack Iran. Oh he's still going to attack, he just has no plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former President Bill Clinton said today he is more worried about his wife's campaign than he's ever been about any of his own elections. Well, sure. He knows if she loses, they have to go home together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Exit polling question: 'Did you have trouble finding the exit?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Three candidates each received 50% of the votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Top half of screen shows election coverage, bottom half is 'American Gladiators'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Pundit says it's looking unlikely Bush will be re-elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's 3 hours of Dog the Bounty Hunter yelling racial slurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Correspondent spends most of the evening hitting on Kucinich's hot wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Wolf Blitzer wanders on set screaming, 'Top story ? daddy's drunk!'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They held the New Hampshire caucuses today. ... When I last checked, Hillary Clinton had a slight lead for the Democrats over Barack Obama. That one was...so close&quot; they &quot;almost had to call Oprah in to make a final decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain...was a big winner up in New Hampshire. ... Fascinating comeback story, this John McCain, quite a guy. Highly decorated veteran. Spent 5 1/2 years in prison then went into politics. Usually it's the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not such good news for John Edwards,&quot; who &quot;came in third&quot; in New Hampshire, &quot;proving, yes, there are two Americas and neither one is voting for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? I heard one of these political pundit guys say on cable today that a lot of people think John Edwards may be too good-looking to be taken seriously. And boy, do I know how that feels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave his State of the State address. He talked about his solution to health care. He said, &quot;Walk it off! Do a few laps! There's nothing wrong with you! Exercise the tumor away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh...and this year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has raised their fee to become a U.S. citizen. How much do you think it costs to become a U.S. citizen? Anybody know? It's about $700, $680, you know. It now costs $700.&quot; In fact, &quot;do you know how much&quot; the INS &quot;expects to make this year on people becoming U.S. citizens? Over $1,400.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Bush is in Israel right now. But he...doesn't really fit there. He showed up today wearing, oh, I guess it was like a ten-gallon yarmulke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you take George Bush out of his own environment, when you take him out of his own culture, like in Israel, for example, he makes mistake.&quot; And &quot;anybody would. Earlier today, he was speaking it a group of people in Jerusalem and he finished up by saying, 'Ich bin ein Jewish guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's no getting around it. George Bush is confused. He thinks a Jewish settlement is Ellen Barkin taking $20 million from Ron Perelman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? Hillary Clinton won the New Hampshire primary last night, huh? It was a surprising victory and today she is denying that she used human growth hormone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And political experts...or pundits are now saying that Hillary got a boost by showing flashes of actual emotion. You know, when she broke down and was teary eyed,&quot; and &quot;I was like, geez, I wonder if that could work for me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton...pulled off that big upset in the New Hampshire primary.&quot; She gave a speech on Monday in which &quot;she got teary-eyed,&quot; and people &quot;are saying that's why she did so well.&quot; If &quot;this crying thing works for Hillary, all the candidates will be doing it,&quot; but &quot;I don't know if I want to see our leaders crying. I don't want to see the President crying. Al Qaeda is out there,&quot; and they are &quot;not crying! Although there are reports that Osama cried at the end of 'Titanic.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you've heard that Hillary Clinton won the New Hampshire Democratic primary last night. She...actually beat Oprah's husband by a very slim margin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met with the prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert.&quot; Olmert &quot;was a little awkward because his English isn't very good and, of course, President Bush's is worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush...said today that he is worried that Iraq will be overrun by religious fundamentalists. Hey, let me tell you something. If it's good enough for the Republican Party, it is good enough for Iraq, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? ... It seems that terrorists are using suicide donkeys to carry out missions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson has dropped out of the presidential race because of his poor showing in Iowa and New Hampshire. Fred Thompson was going to drop out, but nobody knows he's in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market bounced back today, up 117 points. See what happens when Bush leaves the country a few days?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a new trend in the United States now...of having home funerals, green funerals. You know what these are?&quot; There is &quot;no embalming fluid. There's no tomb. There's no casket. The body is wrapped up and put in a shallow grave so it can decompose quickly. Didn't that used to be called murder?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And doctors say new tests are being conducted to see if scorpion venom can cure cancer. You know, why don't these doctors just admit, like, 'We don't know what the hell we're doing.' What's next? Pit bull bites?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for America,&quot; but &quot;not such a great day for Bill Richardson. He dropped out of the presidential race today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see the Golden Globes last night?&quot; Just &quot;because a movie star wins a Golden Globe, that doesn't mean they're going to get an Oscar. The Golden Globes are kind of like the Iowa caucuses for actors.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush currently visiting our good friends in Saudi Arabia. And today, President Bush said the Saudis are fully enlisted in the war on terrorism. Oh, yeah. So fully, they're on both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the country says they are getting more progressive. For example, today, the king said they're considering allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia. Well, except for Lindsay Lohan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know Barbie dolls are banned in Saudi Arabia? It seems Saudi Arabia's religious police believe that Barbie dolls threaten the morality of their culture. I mean, it's okay to have 18 wives. You just can't have a Barbie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read something frightening over the weekend about this terror stuff. They say the scariest weapon terrorists have&quot; is a dirty bomb, which is &quot;a regular bomb that is coated in radioactive waste. It's the same principle as a corndog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it was this week in 1914 that Henry Ford adopted a minimum wage of $5 a day. And today, to prove they are not cheap bastards, NBC told the striking writers they will match that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest scientific evidence, the sun will run out of energy and burn itself out in exactly 5 billion years. I feel so stupid I let that salesman sell me those solar panels for my roof.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the Democratic field really starting to get narrowed down. For Democrats, it's going to be Barack Obama versus Hillary. So, it's a black man or a white woman. ... You know, this is the same decision Michael Jackson has to make every morning of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, because of some discrepancies in the voting, New Hampshire says they will do a hand recount of all of Dennis Kucinich's votes. Luckily, they will only need one hand. So, it shouldn't take too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fred Thompson said he is out trying to revitalize his campaign. What does he mean 're'? When was it vitalized?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, California is having a lot of budget problems, and in his budget talk speech yesterday, our own Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says that California should be more like Arkansas. And today, Britney Spears' pregnant 16-year-old sister said, 'Hey, I'm doing my part.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, 'The New York Times' says the Supreme Court may give the okay for voter I.D. laws. You know what this is? This means you would have to show an I.D. to get into a voting booth, which is pretty amazing considering right now most people don't even show an I.D. to get into the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see the story on the news last night? This is really kind of scary. Because of all the air traffic we have now, planes are flying closer and closer together. ... In fact, a lot of passengers are saying it's actually easier to watch the movie in the plane next to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry. President Bush is already on the problem. He is going to fight the high cost of milk. He is planning to invade Wisconsin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Minnesota, in a test tube with some chemicals have created...a living, beating rat heart. Now, wait a minute. This is great news because rats will now no longer have to wait for a heart donor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the biggest story of all, 'American Idol' is back on the air,&quot; and more Americans &quot;will participate in 'American Idol' than in the election of our next president. ... That's a true fact. And they'll be happier about the result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the big story is of course the return of 'American Idol,'&quot; which has &quot;been off the air for seven months. The world has changed so much since then,&quot; when &quot;bin Laden was at large and Tom Cruise was crazy and this was a show on in the middle of the night and nobody was watching it. Actually, everything is exactly the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday somebody asked Hillary Clinton if she wanted to be on 'American Idol' and she said she would rather be on 'Dancing With The Stars' and Bill Clinton said he would rather be on 'The Bachelor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the search for the next 'American Idol' is underway. In less important election news, Mitt Romney won the Republican primary in&quot; Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats debated tonight in Las Vegas,&quot; and &quot;Dennis Kucinich...got a judge to order MSNBC, the cable channel, to let him be a part of the debate, which is the political equivalent of your mom forcing the other kids to play with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was the big winner in the Michigan Republican primary. Well, you know...his dad used to be governor there, which I think would be inspiration. You know what I'm saying? It proves, in America, you don't have to be the wife of a former president to win. Sometimes you can just be the son of a governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain came in second in Michigan. There was one embarrassing moment yesterday, when McCain spoke at a polling place that was also a funeral home. Yeah. I don't want to say McCain looks old, but when he tried to leave the funeral home, he had to show I.D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton was on 'The Tyra Banks Show,' which will air on Friday. And Tyra asked her if she could be on a reality show, which reality show would she like to be on. And Hillary said, 'Dancing with the Stars', which -- let me tell you something. If Barack Obama keeps doing well, she could be on that show sooner than she thinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know something, these pundits can be very unfair. Like, they always ask Barack Obama if he's black enough. Nobody asks Mitt Romney if he's white enough. I guess he is white enough, actually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was in Saudi Arabia this week, President Bush met with the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. You know, President Bush is not good in these social situations. Like, he kept asking the prince about his sister, Paula Abdullah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Saudi Arabia has pledged...to fight rising oil prices. Let's hope it works out better than their pledge to fight terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Saudi Arabia announced today that contrary to rumors of dwindling oil supplies, they say no, no, they have plenty of oil. In fact, they said with the most recent estimate, they say they have enough oil to keep screwing us for the next 300 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FDA has certified that cloned animal meat is safe to eat. Well, thank God for that. You don't want to eat anything unhealthy in something that you deep fry and batter and then cover in cheese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some amazing medical news. I find this hard to believe. Scientists announced today they've been able to grow rat hearts in a lab. ... Finally some good news for Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in environmental news,&quot; here is &quot;something I never thought of as being a problem, but apparently it is a problem. It seems hybrid vehicles are so quiet at slow speeds, that blind people say they're a safety risk. And, again, another issue President Bush does not understand. Like, today, he said, 'Well, maybe blind people shouldn't be driving.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists...have created a living, beating&quot; rat &quot;heart. ... Finally, good news for Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By gosh, Mitt Romney won the primary in Michigan,&quot; which, &quot;as you know, now makes him a shoe-in to become president of Michigan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all very proud of Mitt. He's the only presidential candidate to come from the Channel 2 News team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain lost in Michigan and supporters are blaming it on his trip to Mexico with Jessica Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President is in the Middle East. Yesterday he was in Saudi Arabia,&quot; but he &quot;was still able to cast his very important vote on 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I noticed that Michigan is kind of shaped like a mitt. And then I remembered that Romney's name is Mitt. And the first rule of primary politics is voters always vote for the candidate whose name is the shape of their state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the big Democratic debate the other night, NBC would not allow presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich into the debate because his poll numbers were not high enough.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee said, when he was in college, he used to use a popcorn popper to fry up squirrels. They'd fry up squirrels and eat them. And people thought this would hurt him in the polls. It turns out, in South Carolina, he went up 30 points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the state of Idaho is now proposing a bill to let liquor stores stay open on Election Day, which I think is a good idea. With these candidates, would you want to vote sober?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Environmentalists in Japan have developed a way to make electricity from human waste. ... There's a situation where you really don't want to live next to the power plant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen this stupid thing that they have on table called the AccuFat analyzer? It's like the size of a cell phone. It keeps track of all of the fat on your body. Do you need this? Anybody have trouble finding the extra fat on their body? 'I put on 50 pounds. I don't know where it could be!' Why don't you just get a hand mirror. 'Oh, there it is. I see it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We finally know the name of the woman who posed for the Mona Lisa. Yup. Her name is Lisa del Giocondo. By the way, her identity was leaked by Scooter Libby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, I don't know if you folks have seen a show here on CBS called 'Without a Trace,'&quot; which had &quot;an exciting episode earlier tonight.&quot; Investigators were &quot;searching for signs of the Giuliani campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because it's a long, horrifying process to run for the nomination and the presidency of the United States, candidates often like to have fun on the campaign trail. And a couple of days ago...Hillary Clinton, while she was flying on her campaign airplane, pretended to be a flight attendant. But that is not all. She was so convincing that Bill actually hit on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on, oh, according to the latest polls, American voters are warming up to Hillary Clinton, you know what this means? This could be the best proof yet of global warming. Hillary's starting to thaw.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Edwards keeps coming in third in all these races around the country. But he said he's not worried. He also said he no longer believes there are two Americas. He now thinks there are three and he's going to keep looking for an American until he finds one that wants him as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And amazingly, there is still no front-runner in the Republican race. Still no clear front-runner. You know, the GOP is starting to look like Britney Spears getting out of the limo. It's wide open, ladies and gentlemen. It is wide open now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So anyway, and Katie Couric asks all the presidential candidates what bad advice you've ever given anyone, what's the worst advice you've ever given anyone? Interesting question. I thought Hillary was the most candid. She said the worst advice she ever gave was when she said to Bill, 'Find out what that tubby intern wants.' That was the worst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, earlier this week, President Bush was in Saudi Arabia. And a lot of Saudi Arabian leaders have come forward to say they are opposed to terrorism. You really think they're sincere? Their kind of like those public service announcements where the rock stars say, 'Hey, kids, don't do drugs.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's big news for TV viewers, 'American Idol' is coming back. Fantastic show. It's a tremendous, honestly. In terms of entertainment, it's just one step above karaoke. Honestly. You know the 'American Idol' features a group of self-deluded pretenders and publicity seekers; it's just like the presidential race. Thanks. Thank you so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to John McCain,&quot; who &quot;won the South Carolina Republican primary. You know, McCain is described as a GOP maverick. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's one of those philosophical questions. If Fred Thompson stopped campaigning, how could you tell?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Saudi Arabia last week, President Bush was criticized for doing a little ceremonial dance with a sword given to him by the Saudi prince. A lot of people thought the President was pandering to the Saudis. To be fair, I don't think the President was pandering. See, I think President Bush is truly fascinated by bright, shiny objects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Saudi Arabia, it cost me 65 bucks to fill up my car today, my Corvair. ... Remember when 65 bucks would buy you a large latte at Starbucks? What happened to those days?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, gas is so expensive, in Beverly Hills I saw a guy sitting in his Rolls-Royce putting French's mustard on his hot dog because he couldn't afford the Grey Poupon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pundits say that Mitt Romney may actually be too good-looking to be president. Well, that's what keeps me from running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney looks like he is the closer at a Cadillac dealership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney looks like that guy on the golf course in the Levitra commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Florida, the preparations for the upcoming primary are going on. They have one week left to make sure the voting machines don't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was a big day in Hollywood. The Academy Awards were announced. It looks like a lot of Oscar buzz for 'No Country For Old Men',&quot; which &quot;I think was also John McCain's campaign slogan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another big Oscar nod for 'There Will Be Blood', the story of a ruthless oil tycoon. Or, as Dick Cheney calls it, 'the greatest movie of all time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, as you know, South Carolina was a big win for Sen. McCain, not so much for Huckabee. Yeah, for Mike Huckabee, it was the biggest setback, well, since that squirrel blew a fuse in the popcorn popper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, what happened yesterday between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama? What was that, high school? Did you see that debate? Remember earlier yesterday, on Martin Luther King Day, they were talking about peace, Dr. King bringing together, putting aside our differences. That didn't last long, huh? Then the debate turned into, 'You're a doody head.' 'No, you're a doody head!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Fred Thompson dropped out of the presidential race. Do you think he knows yet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing standing between Fred and the White House -- the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Super Tuesday coming up -- 23 states, 70 million votes. That is almost as much as 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Florida is the big one for the Republicans. In fact, Florida is the first state where Rudy Giuliani is seriously campaigning. See, for Giuliani, primaries are kind of like marriages. The first two or three don't really count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard...Iran and Syria have been printing counterfeit $100 bills in order to ruin the U.S. economy? Hey, you're about four years too late, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Iranians really want to ruin our economy,&quot; they should &quot;make TVs and cars. That's what the Japanese did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody talks about global warming and the environment. A lot of environmental terms are confusing to people. They don't know the real definition. For example, the warming of the atmosphere from pollution, that's called the greenhouse effect. ... Having to live in the smog and pollution in LA, see, that's called the outhouse effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And doing nothing about it, that's called the White House effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten George W. Bush Ideas For Stimulating The Economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Send troops to invade U.S. Mint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Oprah gives everybody a new car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Turn Grand Canyon into a giant national 'Have a penny, leave a penny' jar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Cheney threatens to shoot treasury secretary in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Plans to fix economy in third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Replace Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke with briefcase babes from 'Deal or No Deal'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Send elite team of economists to rob Mick Jagger's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Ahhh -- somebody help...Cloverfield monster...Run for your lives!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Maybe not spending a billion dollars a month in Iraq?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Forget the economy -- why doesn't someone try stimulating Condoleezza?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you folks worried about the economy? Stock market crumbling. Everybody is crazy about this. Don't worry. George W. Bush says he's got something in mind to give it a shot in the arm. If that doesn't work, Cheney is going to give it a shot in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the presidential debate last night on CNN? Whoa! It was great. It was exciting. Sparks were flying. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama kept arguing, going at one another. ... Honest to God, John Edwards looked like the moderator on 'Family Feud.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But during the argument between Obama and Clinton, security guards had to be brought in. You could hear Hillary screaming, 'Don't tase me, bro!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't know if you heard this or not but Fred Thompson has dropped out of the presidential race. Don't worry about Fred. He can always go back to his prestigious fake law firm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What about that Mitt Romney? ... He looks like a guy who would run a seminar on condo flipping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney &quot;looks like a weekend weather man, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney &quot;looks like the neighbor who spends way too much on his lawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great day for America everybody. ... Not such a great day for Fred Thompson. He dropped out of the presidential race. I think I speak for us all when I say, Fred Thompson was in the presidential race?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Thompson gone, the door is wide open for the other guys. John McCain is one of them. His campaign team is going to the Florida to get ready for the primary and Hillary Clinton's campaign team is going there to get an early start for Bill on Spring Break.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in South Carolina, former 'Law &amp; Order' star Fred Thompson has dropped out of the presidential race. Yeah. He also came in a distant third,&quot; which &quot;would be great if he was still on NBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're sad to see Fred Thompson drop out. I just hope this doesn't give his face that gloomy hangdog look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Rudy Giuliani is having a rough time in Florida. Man, I tell you, his early lead evaporated quicker than those wedding vows, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as if this field isn't crowded enough, Ralph Nader says he will decide in a month whether he'll run for president again. ... Hey, he's ready to go. Luckily, his suit is still unpressed from the last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the presidential race? Exciting, isn't it?&quot; And &quot;how about that Mitt Romney, huh? I mean, this guy looks like&quot; he should &quot;be selling fruit dehydrators on cable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, if Mitt Romney is elected, he will be the first president ever sworn in on a copy of 'GQ.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden's son is now doing TV shows. He was on the 'Today' show the other day. ... I mean, is that ? I'm almost too embarrassed to be on my own show.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this guy goes out and he's now saying his dad is very sorry for attacking the United States. ... He says, 'Dad is very sorry about that whole attack thing.' Well, that's good enough for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But apparently, and it's not hard to believe,&quot; this guy, Omar bin Laden, &quot;had a troubled childhood, a difficult past. When he was 17 -- and this is true, I looked it up -- when he was 17, he wrecked his dad's camel. He wrecked his camel!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you all know, earlier tonight President Bush gave his big State of Delusion address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, in last year's State of the Union speech, President Bush said, 'The economy is on the move.' This year, he said, 'Where'd it go?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, political pundits say that President Bush will try to make every moment count, because he's only got one year left. Tell me about it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like even President Bush is now being affected by the writers' strike? Well sure, no new 'SpongeBob' episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the rumor is today, we are very close to settling the writers' strike. I hope so, because we are running out of animal acts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, congratulations to Barack Obama,&quot; who &quot;won big in South Carolina. ... The big issue in South Carolina was lost textile jobs,&quot; which is &quot;why Hillary was so stunned she came in a distant second. In fact, today she said, 'I've been wearing all of these pants suits for nothing?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell...John Edwards is a little disappointed with his third place finish. In fact, for one millionth of a second, he actually stopped smiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say that John Edwards seemed phony, but a lot of voters thought Hillary's southern accept was more real than his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something interesting. Exit polls showed that Bill's campaigning actually hurt Hillary. I just hope it doesn't...cause any tension in their marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Bill was really upset by her second place finish. In fact, today, he said, 'Does this mean I don't get a third term?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Rudy Giuliani thinks Florida is the key to victory. I'll tell that to the Miami Dolphins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, three Cubans floated into Miami, saw Giuliani and said, 'Wow, we thought it was risky for us to put everything on Florida.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Giuliani's Florida...strategy&quot; is &quot;pretty smart,&quot; because &quot;if he doesn't win there, he can always retire. He's already there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists say that the giant asteroid collision that almost destroyed the Earth 65 million years ago could hit again in a billion years. Yeah! Hopefully, by then we will have some kind of healthcare plan, so it won't be that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? All the candidates are talking about national healthcare but doctors don't want it. Doctors worry the national healthcare plan would drastically cut their pay. Yeah, to give you an idea how much of a pay cut doctors would have to take, they said by the year 2010, you could actually have a lot of doctors playing on public golf courses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened earlier tonight? It was the annual State of the Union address. ... By the way, this is President Bush's last State of the Union address.&quot; The next one &quot;will be given by co-presidents Bill and Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be like Bill and Hillary will be the Presidents of the United States,&quot; and &quot;I'm thinking this is going to be tremendous&quot; because it is &quot;going to be like Regis and Kelly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, President Bush is standing there giving his State of the Union, and behind him you can see Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi sitting right&quot; there, looking &quot;like a married couple waiting for their divorce to be final.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But during the State of the Union address, whoa, what a rowdy crowd. ... At one point Cheney had to fire a couple of shots in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what happened on Saturday?&quot; The Miss America Pageant, and the winner, Kirsten Haglund, is &quot;the prettiest thing to come out of Michigan since Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush gave the State of the Union address earlier this evening and wasn't it great? It was. I found it very moving and inspiring and very...I didn't watch it either.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is the last speech that Bush will give as President. It was like a farewell special edition of 'Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?'&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you watched the President's state of the union address last night, you know that President Bush promised to cut 151 programs that are performing poorly. Or as we call that at NBC, our fall schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said the State of the Union was good, not as good as his buddies at Exxon, but still pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also promoted his stimulus package, where each American will get $600. This is part of the 'You got Screwed, But Here's Cab Fare' plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see Hillary Clinton watching President Bush? Oh, my God. I mean, she was giving him the same look she gives Bill when he comes home after midnight with some lame excuse, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the President was speaking last night, they had an online translation of the speech in Arabic, Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, Farsi and Spanish. So, I guess President Bush really is trying to reach out to the people of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama got a big boost with that Kennedy family endorsement. Did you see that? ... Now, the next party endorsement is Al Gore. And both Barack and Hillary are going all out to try and avoid that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, and Bill Clinton's starting to lose his cool out on the campaign trail. You see him on the news the other day? He's waving his finger at reporters. Oh, man, he was mad! You ever notice when Bill Clinton gets mad, his face turns...red? He looks like he robbed a bank and the dye pack in the money blew off in his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm serious. In fact, Al Sharpton was on 'The View' yesterday, urging President Clinton to shut up with the race comments. But unfortunately, since Al was on 'The View,' he couldn't get in a word edgewise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And despite everything, John Edwards' poll numbers have not moved,&quot; like &quot;his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edwards said the other day, 'There are three people here, not two.' The bad news: it was at his campaign rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Faith is playing a big part in this year's election. You have Huckabee, the evangelical guy. See, these fellas get a lot of people concerned about the separation of church and state. Do you know how that came about? Anybody know? See, the separation of church and state is made very clear by our founding fathers. See, what they did is they looked at the Ten Commandments. 'Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not commit adultery.' Then they looked at Congress and realized, well these two could never get together. We have to separate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Florida primaries were today. And to accommodate...the senior citizens voting, the polls are staying open late -- 5:00 p.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is kind of sad, moments ago Al Gore demanded a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was President Bush's last State of the Union address. ... And he said what he will miss most about the State of the Union address are the fake standing ovations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the experts are saying that the State of the Union address was very...ambitious. President Bush said he plans to introduce dozens of bold new mispronunciations. So look for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But during the speech, President Bush was optimistic and upbeat about Iraq and the economy. So apparently he's drinking again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a frightening proposition to be alive walking around this planet in 2008. Listen to this, a 20,000 pound satellite has burned out. It's out of its orbit,&quot; with no &quot;power. The thing is just junk. And it's going to crash into us. It's already starting to plummet and soon it will explode and there's going to be a fire and the thing is just going to hit the -- oh, wait a minute. Sorry, I'm thinking about the Giuliani campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Florida primary was today,&quot; and &quot;I am worried about John McCain. I wonder if he will make it to the rest of the primaries. Usually when a man of his age goes to Florida, they don't come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush &quot;gave his last State of the Union address last night. There aren't too many people who will tell you that President Bush was a great president. And if there are, they probably work for Fox News.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Senator John McCain, the big winner in Florida. ... You know, this was what they call a GOP-only primary. So McCain had to win over a whole new voter group for him -- Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it was a tough fight for McCain, because a lot of Florida voters were not sure about him. You know, at age 71, McCain was a lot younger than most Florida Republicans, so they were a little leery that some punk is coming in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democrats will not count the Florida vote. They're punishing Florida for moving their primary up. ... So the delegates don't count. How ironic is that? The one election in Florida that gets done early and it doesn't count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like Rudy Giuliani is out of the race. So finally we have a...Republican with an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, both Rudy Giuliani and John Edwards officially dropped out of the race today. I love how candidates have to make it official when they drop out. Like we have no idea they lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monday morning, the Super Bowl losing team doesn't go, 'You know something? I think we lost. It's official.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has announced his new economic plan this week. It's called 'The Check Is In The Mail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Barack Obama at that rally surrounded by all those Kennedys? Man, I couldn't tell if he was running for president or bartender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, listen to this. According to the Department of Agriculture, Americans are eating four times as much Mexican food as we did 20 years ago. You know why? We have four times as many Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was watching this ad&quot; on &quot;one of the cable shows today,&quot; and &quot;I saw a gun...spokesman&quot; and &quot;they asked him why we have over 30,000 gun deaths a year while England and Japan have less than 100 gun deaths. And he said, 'That's because we're better shots.' You know, it seemed like the wrong answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, in America, we have a five-day waiting period to buy a gun, unless you buy a gun at Sears. Then it's a ten-day waiting period. Did you know that? ... Well, it's five days for the background check and then five days to find a sales clerk to ring it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, currently, there's a huge caviar shortage in Russia because the fish that makes the caviar, the sturgeon, is on the brink of extinction due to overfishing. Imagine that, no more caviar. This could be&quot; the first time &quot;in history Republicans care about an endangered species.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this presidential race. It's getting crazier and crazier. ... Yesterday in Florida they had the primary. Rudy Giuliani came in third,&quot; so he &quot;dropped out of the presidential race. But don't worry about him. He's already busy looking for wife number four. So he's got his hands full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this? John Edwards also dropped out the race today. He said he wants to spend more time with his haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry about Edwards. He's going back to host 'Wheel of Fortune,' so he'll be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Florida retirees didn't go for that Mitt Romney, either. No, he reminded them...of a guy who tries to get a hold of their nest egg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney reminded Florida retirees &quot;of a guy who sells subdivision in the Everglades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney reminded Florida retirees &quot;of the guy who pitches overpriced cemetery plots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney reminded Florida retirees &quot;of the pharmacist who doesn't accept their prescription plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is a time in the campaign where everybody is crazy about the endorsements, the big endorsements. Listen to this. Janet Reno...has endorsed Hillary Clinton. However, this endorsement is slightly tainted because, as you know, Janet Reno was mentioned in the Mitchell Report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me ask you something, ladies and gentlemen. Do you like celebrity birthdays? Who doesn't? Vice President Dick Cheney&quot; is &quot;67 years old today,&quot; and friends &quot;got together and threw a big party for him. And then Cheney tortured the cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone at Cheney's party &quot;enjoyed playing Shoot the Tail Off the Donkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know,&quot; not only will Bush soon &quot;be out of a gig, Cheney will also be out of the office. Don't worry about him. After leaving office, he has it all lined up. He is going to be doing a one-man show right here on Broadway&quot; called &quot;'The Angina Monologues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Dick Cheney's birthday&quot; and there was a big &quot;celebration in Washington,&quot; with a &quot;21-gun salute. Each gun aimed at a different lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain did well yesterday, winning in Florida. Who say it's is no country for old men?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has plans to stop McCain's momentum. He is going to take the tennis balls off of McCain's walker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Edwards and Rudy Giuliani both today announced they're pulling out of the race for president so they can spend more time with each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Giuliani said he's going to stay active. He said he'll endorse John McCain. Whereas Edwards said he will endorse Herbal Essence Fruit Fusions Shampoo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Republican race is now down to McCain and Romney. Interesting two guys. You got the guy who spent five years in a prison camp versus the guy who spent five years in the tanning booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today our own Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed McCain. At least I think he did. He said, 'Yeah, McCain, the war, economy, the people, they're getting us together to bring the country' ? something...like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, the most amazing results from this Florida primary election. Just the fact we have same-day results from a Florida election. That has never happened before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know...John Edwards is out, to which Senator Larry Craig said, 'He's gay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something kind of interesting. Do you know the two places in the United States that have the highest alcohol consumption? ... Las Vegas and Washington, DC. Isn't that amazing? The only difference is, in Vegas, the drunks are gambling with their own money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Researchers have now developed a pacemaker that can stimulate the brain. It can actually make the brain function again. You know what that means? Now both Bush and Cheney will be wearing pacemakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's one of those studies&quot; that &quot;had to come from the tobacco country. I saw it in the paper today. It says smokers can keep weight off better than those who have quit smoking. Oh, yeah, what a great way to lose weight. 'Bob, you look terrific. Diet, exercise?' 'Emphysema.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the German magazine 'Horticulture,' scientists in Germany have genetically engineered a walking tree. Did you hear about this? You may have seen this on the news. It's an evergreen that has surface roots that grow forward searching for moisture and nutrients, and this pulls the tree along. In fact, that's how Al Gore gets around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you been following this tax evasion trial that Wesley Snipes is involved in? Doesn't look good for Wesley. ... He said the IRS deliberately picks on African-Americans. To which Willy Nelson said, 'In that case, I really got screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see the Republican debate last night? ... Nasty, nasty debate. At one point, Mitt Romney got so upset, so...agitated, so worked up, that his hair cracked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney doesn't look like a president. He looks like a ring master.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt looks like a guy wearing a golf shirt in an Eddie Bauer catalog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt looks like the desk clerk in a Peninsula Hotel who tells you your room's not ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt looks like a guy at a party who gives you his card.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt &quot;looks like a tennis pro at a restricted tennis club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt &quot;looks like a JetBlue pilot who comes out to greet the passengers during the delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then earlier tonight, by gosh, at the Democratic debate,&quot; there &quot;was a tag team format. You had Hillary and Bill versus Obama and Oprah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democratic debate took place in Hollywood. And Hillary arrived wearing a...sequined pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Hollywood, this is exciting. Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed John McCain. Uh-huh. ... Arnold made his announcement in primitive sign language from his cage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then on Tuesday, Arnold will go into the voting booth and pull the lever with his feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know it is a great day for Barack Obama. He raised $32 million last month. That is incredible! You know how he did it? He was on Oprah. He found it down the back of the couch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now tonight, of course, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had&quot; a &quot;debate up on Hollywood Boulevard. That is unusual. Normally the only debate on Hollywood Boulevard is, 'Is that a man or a woman?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate was held in the same place they have the Oscars. Hillary got a supplemental award for Best Actress. Do you remember when Hillary cried? It was very emotional.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all see Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton last night at the big debate? You see them sitting side by side, staring at the camera. Didn't they look like one of those bad local eyewitness news teams?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Hillary is getting a little too sensitive, too. Like, when they asked her about the surge, she said she didn't want to talk about Barack's poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had Senator John McCain on the show last night. And if he wins, he would be the oldest president ever to take office. But the good news, at age 71, he would be eligible for pre-boarding on Air Force One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you noticed how all these action stars now are endorsing candidates? Like, Mike Huckabee has Chuck Norris. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger came out for John McCain. And today, Hillary Clinton picked up Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Both the Republicans and the Democrats have competing growth packages. Let me tell you something. The only person with a growth package in this country that works -- Barry Bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the news today, they showed a bunch of these Afghan farmers planting poppy seeds. And one of the farmers said he knows that people will die from the heroin he grows, but if he doesn't grow heroin, his family will starve to death. Hey, farmer, genius, why don't you try growing some food? Okay? Try a potato! Grow a potato! You could eat the potato!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Groundhog Day, ladies and gentlemen. It's funny. Earlier today in Washington DC, a confused President Bush pardoned a turkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big debates in the race for the White House. At the Republican debate, John McCain insisted his age does not define him. Then he told everyone to 'get off my lawn!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also this week, Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed John McCain, and then groped his ass.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked my daughter who she liked for president today. She told me she likes Obama because she he has big ears like Will Smith. You know, ear size is one of the key issues with young people nowadays.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing about Los Angeles? This city never fails to amaze me. Last week Governor Schwarzenegger was in town, all the Republican candidates were here, all the Democratic candidates were here, all with Secret Service protection.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, have you heard about this satellite that's about to fall out of the sky and crash to Earth? It's like the size of a bus.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend was Groundhog Day. ... I like Groundhog Day. I mean, it is nice to see something coming out of a hole in a ground that's not running for president. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton said the other day that we need to slow down the economy to fight global warming.&quot; That &quot;means George Bush has done more to stop global warming than Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John Edwards said that even though he is out of the presidential race, he still cares for the little people. And today, to prove it, he had lunch with Dennis Kucinich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting? Even though McCain is the front-runner tomorrow in the big Super Duper Tuesday thing, the other GOP candidates still sniping at each other. You been following this? Romney wants Huckabee to quit. Some think that McCain is too liberal. Others think Romney is too conservative. Remember the good old days when the Republican Party was united against the poor? What happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, federal researchers say there's an increase in the number of kids...smoking cigarettes. Not teenagers, kids. ... Isn't that horrible? And the tobacco companies say they're doing all they can to prevent kids from smoking. They say they can't help it if the kids happen to like the new 'Flintstone Lights.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Purdue University says that eating a lot of hamburgers can prevent skin cancer,&quot; which &quot;is good to know because if you eat a lot of hamburgers, you're going to have a lot more skin to protect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know tomorrow's Super Tuesday, are you aware of that fact? ... How about that Mitt Romney? Am I right about Mitt Romney? He looks like the guy that would approve your check at a supermarket.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today&quot; is &quot;Stupid Tuesday, or whatever they call it. Super Tuesday. ... And you know what's interesting? So many people voted by mail&quot; that &quot;they're getting votes for candidates that have dropped out, like John Edwards, Fred Thompson,&quot; and &quot;Rudy Giuliani. In fact, the mail is so slow they're also getting votes for Hubert Humphrey&quot; and &quot;Adlai Stevenson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, all the candidates are out there stumping like it's November. Do you know why campaigning is called stumping? ... It's called stumping because...when you ask&quot; the candidates &quot;'When are we getting out of Iraq,' they're stumped. You see. 'How about healthcare?' Stumped. 'Economy?' Stumped. See, that's where...it comes from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a company here in Los Angeles is making these dolls of all the current political figures. ... They're not like normal dolls. You know those ones where you pull the string and the dolls talk? These are a little different. These you have to make a large donation to the campaign, and then the dolls will say and do whatever you want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven out of 10 American high school students could not find Canada on a map. ... You know, you want high school kids to find Canada on a map? Bring back the draft, okay? They will find it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Mitt Romney, huh? This guy looks like a lawyer who advertises on the back of a bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Super Tuesday,&quot; and &quot;it's also Fat Tuesday, the beginning of Mardi Gras. Happy Super Fat Tuesday to everyone. I'm your super fat host.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you had a chance to vote today. I voted in a garage down the block from my house,&quot; under &quot;tight security too. There were at least four 80-year-old people guarding the place. I really hope they remembered to turn the box in, because it's entirely possible that they didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did anyone else vote in a garage today? Yeah?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain was the big Republican winner. You know, one pundit said McCain's lucky nickel was working. He talked about this on our show.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton also carries a lucky nickel. Not for superstitious reasons. She just flips it when she needs a position on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney did not do too well. Mitt Romney keeps touting the importance of having a job in the private sector. Now it looks like he may need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say Romney did bad, but this is the worst night for Mormons since Marie Osmond passed out on 'Dancing With The Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney spent something like $35 million of his own money. ... If he loses anymore, he might have to run as a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the&quot; Romney &quot;kids are going, 'Pop, our inheritance!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush delivered his new budget. It's in two parts -- smoke and mirrors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sunday, after the Super Bowl, President Bush called the New York Giants coach to offer his congratulations. And then he called the Patriots coach to find out how he can erase some embarrassing spy video.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But technically speaking, Mitt did not drop out of the campaign. He suspended his campaign. ... You know, the same way Elvis suspended his career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if he suspends his campaign, Mitt gets to keep his delegates. And I'm thinking, whoa, how would you like to be those five guys?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great day for America everybody,&quot; but not &quot;such a great day for Mitt Romney.&quot; The &quot;first Mormon presidential candidate has dropped out of the...race. He says he wants to focus on 2012, which is how many wives he has.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Romney out of the race now, Republican front-runner John McCain is busy refocusing his efforts on wooing conservatives who think he's too liberal. Today, he built a fence around our parking lot security guard, Guillermo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing how quickly things change in politics. I was talking about it this morning with my driver, Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess you know by now. Yesterday, Mitt Romney threw in the monogrammed towel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That leaves just McCain and Huckabee, the old guy and the preacher, which brings up the philosophical question, which one is closer to God?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like John McCain has gotten the nod. ... Of course, McCain getting a nomination, this is Rush Limbaugh's worst nightmare since the pharmacist said, 'We're out of OxyContin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here in California, Hillary Clinton has the support, of course, of Bill Clinton, L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. Or as she calls them, 'the party unfaithful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Fashion Week in New York City. ... And everybody in New York gets into Fashion Week. As a matter of fact, Hillary Clinton today was wearing her strapless pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was interesting. Rudy Giuliani is announcing his own line of clothing,&quot; which &quot;comes apart at the seams.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney &quot;looks like one of those guys whose cologne you smell long after he's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney &quot;looks like a lawyer in a yellow pages ad, I'm telling you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney &quot;looks like a guy who says, 'Everything I tried -- creams, lotions, ointments -- nothing worked.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has announced that during President Bush's last year in office, he's going to visit more countries than in any other year of his Presidency. Yeah. Yeah, Bush says he's going to accomplish all of this in one weekend, by going to Epcot Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know who you're going to vote for? ... Most Republicans, I think, have a pretty good idea, but Democrats are split pretty evenly between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. I always say when in doubt, let your favorite celebrities decide. For instance, if you like Chuck Norris, you vote for Mike Huckabee. If you love Wilford Brimley, John McCain is your man.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to presidential candidate Barack Obama. He won a Grammy last night for best spoken word album. Boy, there's four words you haven't heard in the same sentence in a while ? 'presidential' and 'best spoken word.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know who he beat out? Bill Clinton. Hope this doesn't cause any tension between the two families.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Hillary Clinton's female campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, resigned. You know what that means? Sounds like Bill got caught again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Barack Obama is now calling for the Clintons to release all of their tax information. And 'Newsweek' estimates Bill Clinton made between $10 million and $15 million last year for speaking engagements. ... See, that explains why Hillary hardly ever speaks to him anymore. She can't afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And asked why he is still in the race, Mike Huckabee said, 'I have nothing else to do.' ... So it sounds like he really is running for vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republicans say that John McCain will be good for business. They didn't say what business, but I'm guessing probably the Scooter Store, Doan's Pills, Craftmatic Adjustable Bed,&quot; and &quot;the Miracle Ear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, Mitt Romney's campaign is dead. Although I understand why those officials just told President Bush he went to 'live on a farm.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess this is good news. Musicians in Afghanistan are now being allowed to play western music again. In fact, you know what the most popular music is in Afghanistan right now? I'm not making this up -- disco. ... See, I guess we were able to work out some kind of compromise. We brought them out of the 13th century, but only brought them up to 1978.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lawmakers here in California want to put a new law in the books that says if you're a prostitute and you're convicted of prostitution, you lose your driver's license for six months, yeah. You know what that means if this law passes? We could have hookers out walking the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now predict in the near future -- I find this hard to believe -- that it will be possible for people to live to be 200 years old. ... How crowded is Florida going to be then?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that presidential campaign, huh? Mitt Romney now has suspended his campaign,&quot; but &quot;don't worry about Mitt. He's already gone back to playing Ridge Forrester on 'The Bold and the Beautiful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I'm going to miss Mitt Romney. He looked like the white hunter who ignores...Tarzan's warning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like now Hillary Clinton is trailing Barack Obama. And so, Hillary's campaign&quot; is dealing with &quot;a little bit of desperation now. And earlier today, she fired her campaign manager,&quot; as well as &quot;her pantsuit designer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Hillary replaced her campaign manager, Patti Doyle was her name. And she hired in her place Maggie Williams. So for the first time Hillary now is juggling more women than Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very awkward moment in the Hillary Clinton campaign today. I guess Hillary told her staff to call Democrats with money, and they called Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. They did a poll on whether Bill's campaigning for Hillary helped her or hurt her. And 38% thought it hurt her, 36% thought it helped her, and 26% said, 'He never told me he was married!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the government is going to be handing out rebate checks. We're like a bad car dealership now in this country,&quot; handing &quot;out the rebate checks. They're trying to restore confidence in the US economy. The bad news -- half the people want the money in euros, the other half want it in pesos.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll, the nation's youth do not have as much faith in the federal government being able to help them in their future. Fifty percent of the young people polled said they felt the federal government would get in their way of their goals and their ambitions. The other 50% said they had no goals or ambitions and hoped to work for the Federal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists for the United States Army...have developed a sandwich&quot; that &quot;can remain edible for three years. ... Well, if that doesn't get guys to re-up, nothing will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you, that shows you how dedicated our armed forces are. I mean, the other side offers their guys, what, 72 virgins? We get a three-year-old sandwich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the way these sandwiches work is if they're not eaten in three years, they're taken out of the military rotation, and they're used to refill bus station vending machines all across the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Seriously, what the hell is happening on 'Lost?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so...cold here in New York City&quot; that &quot;Al Gore wasn't answering his phone.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, talk about a black eye for baseball. You know what's happening today? Congressional investigations into Roger Clemens and the steroid use begin tomorrow. And it's interesting, you know? We didn't get bin Laden but by God, we're nailing this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Roger Clemens&quot; is &quot;expected to testify that a size 48 neck is completely normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today...is the ninth anniversary of Bill Clinton's acquittal on impeachment charges. ... I wonder how those crazy kids celebrated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course Mitt Romney dropped out of the race,&quot; and &quot;I'm going to miss&quot; him. Romney &quot;looked like a close personal friend of the late Bob Crane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like a guy who says to the bartender, 'If I wanted a glass of tonic, I would have ordered it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like a guy you just met who uses your first name too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney looks like a cavalry officer who has no intention of honoring the treaty with the Apaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a great day for Hillary Clinton. She has lost more primaries. She has been calling her supporters to let them know her campaign is not in financial trouble. But the bad part is she is calling collect.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not a big night last night for Hillary Clinton. Man, she got the pantsuit beaten off of her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama now considered the front-runner,&quot; after winning the &quot;last eight primaries,&quot; but &quot;they say the race between Barack and Hillary could be decided by the voters of Texas.&quot; That &quot;is a comfort, because when it comes to providing smart politicians, Texas is the place you want to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain did very well. He swept as well. He won all his primaries. Of course, the big question with McCain...is the age thing. Now, I don't want to say he's old,&quot; but &quot;I understand his new campaign slogan is, 'Why did I come in here again?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA has admitted to destroying videotapes of terror suspects being tortured. They said today the reason they destroyed the videotapes was, under a new agreement, they didn't want to have to pay the writers residuals every time they showed up on the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a survey on yoo-hoo.com, 43% of employees say they could do a better job than their boss. The other 57% did not work for the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like Mitt Romney and I'm going to miss him because he looks like the archeologist who ignores the curse of the mummy's tomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like the dull fianc?e Julia Roberts dumps for the co-star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like the author of the book on seven keys to success.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like a guy extolling the virtues of buying a lap pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like Elizabeth Taylor's husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looks like a guy who wears a wig and sneaks on to the lifeboat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's going on down in Washington, D.C., ladies and gentlemen? Our tax dollars at work, Roger Clemens testifying before Congress about steroids use and human growth hormone and stuff.&quot; Clemens &quot;vehemently denied using steroids. At one point he got so angry that he snapped the Washington Monument in half like a twig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The writers' strike, finally over.&quot; And while &quot;our writers were gone, Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama both declared their support for the writers' strike. I thought that was cool. Yeah. Meanwhile, President Bush announced he's in favor of a readers' strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton, of course, in the news&quot; after losing &quot;eight primaries in a row to Barack Obama. ... Yeah. Hillary dismissed Obama's success by saying, 'He's only winning states with a huge African-American population, like Maine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the Republican side, of course, John McCain's on a...big roll right now. After John McCain swept yesterday's primaries, he purposely stole a line Barack Obama's been using, 'I'm fired up and ready to go.' Yeah. When Obama heard this, he stole a line McCain's been using, 'I'm old, and not sure where I am.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Roger Clemens testified before Congress about his alleged use of steroids and human growth hormone. ... He says he didn't do it,&quot; but &quot;there was an awkward moment when Clemens leaned on the table and it shattered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Roger Clemens sat in front of Congress today to answer questions about whether or not he used performance-enhancing drugs. He says he didn't,&quot; and &quot;is sticking to his story. And, of course, his story is he was bitten by a radioactive steroid and suddenly he developed magical pitching powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you call it when Bill and Hillary get together on Valentine' Day? A fundraiser!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has not been a good week for Hillary. I guess Bill bought her a dozen roses for Valentine' Day. t turns out, seven of the roses have committed to Michelle Obama.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain is the Republican front-runner. You know, at his age, it's tough for him to raise money at these fundraising dinners because, apparently, nobody else wants to eat dinner at 4:00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, John McCain's former rival, Mitt Romney endorsed McCain for president today. ... I guess Romney forgot he called McCain a 'decrepit, old Washington insider.' And it slipped McCain's mind that he called Romney a 'plastic, flip-flopping hypocrite.' 'I love you, man!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President of Mexico Felipe Calderon is in the United States. Before he came here, he sent his advance team, all 12 million of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the chief of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff,&quot; was at Harvard last week, where &quot;he said the United States is now backsliding on many elements of national security, from weak border patrol to the risk of chemical bombs. Gee, if there was someone we could get in touch to talk to about this, like maybe the chief of Homeland Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Major League Baseball players reported to spring training today. Well, half of them did. The other half reported to Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for roger Clemens. Did you see today? Oh, boy. He tested positive for BS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Clemens in Congress, sitting before that committee? Didn't he look uncomfortable? Huh? He looked like President Bush trying to play 'Jeopardy,' didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, was there one embarrassing moment during the hearings when Congressman Henry Waxman said, 'Allow me to inject something here.' And then Clemens stood up and pulled his pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday appearing on stage together in Boston, Mitt Romney endorsed John McCain. You see that picture? You see him standing there? Looked like the head of Leisure World giving out an award to the senior shuffleboard champion. You know something? I don't think there's been a more uncomfortable embrace between two politicians since the last time Bill hugged Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, political experts say that Mitt Romney has the number one thing John McCain is looking for in a vice presidential candidate, an organ donor card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And things aren't looking good for Hillary. Like a lot of women in Washington, I think she's just starting to realize she may have slept with Bill Clinton for nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview in 'People' magazine, Barack Obama said he was more a fan of Sonny and Cher than he was a fan of Donny and Marie. Well, that should answer the question of whether he's black enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard the U.S. military is going to shoot down that satellite that's falling to Earth. See, I knew this would happen. I knew it was just a matter of time before President Bush did a preemptive strike on ourselves. Do you know his rationale for shooting down the satellite? He said he wants to try and bring democracy to outer space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see Roger Clemens testifying this week before Congress? One Congressman named Elijah Cummings called Clemens, 'one of my heroes,' and then called him a liar. So, I guess that's what makes you a hero to a congressman pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is holding hearings on baseball and steroids. Congress is committed to removing performance-enhancing drugs from baseball. You know, I got a better idea. Why don't we get performance-enhancing drugs out of baseball and give them to Congress? What is their approval rate? 13%? Maybe it would help.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on Bill O'Reilly's show on Fox, Bill O'Reilly does a segment he calls 'Pinhead or Patriot.' And today President Bush said, 'well, why can't you be both?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week in Sacramento, Mexican President Felipe Calderon spoke to California lawmakers. And out of force of habit, they gave him a driver's license.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says if John McCain is the Republican nominee, he will campaign for him. Well, you can't do better than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Mitt Romney, you know, he resigned. He dropped out of the campaign. He put it on hold. He suspended his campaign that is the word, he suspended his campaign. A lot of you folks are worried about Mitt. Don't worry about Mitt. He has already gone back to playing Trevor St. John on One Life To Live. So I'll be fine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney &quot;looked like the guy who filled in for the Broadway star the night you have tickets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, just a few hours ago, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney asked his supporters to back Senator John McCain. McCain is hoping that his white supporters will hit it off with Romney's really white supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is scheduled to take a trip to Africa. Yeah. When asked about it, President Bush said, 'I'm looking forward to meeting the leader of the African-Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new research study estimates by the year 2050, the population of the U.S. will reach 438 million. Right now, we have 300 million. They say the growth will primarily be driven by Latino immigrants. In fact, everyone look to your left now and look to your right. According to this report, in 40 years, we will all be Mexican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, former President George H.W. Bush will endorse Senator John McCain for president. They have been close friends since the Civil War and the former president says that John McCain is the only candidate who has the strength, the leadership and the vision to dig America out of this giant hole his son has put us in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is, of course, the day we celebrate the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, or as President Bush calls them, 'Mr. Quarter and Mr. Penny.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary Clinton out on the campaign trail. She's very sly. You know, she's been campaigning about Black History Month,&quot; and she &quot;said today that America has come so far that a black man could one day grow up and possibly be vice president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary has lost the last eight primaries in a row. So, any crying you see from now on is going to be real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator John McCain was on the 'Larry King' show the other night. He and Larry got in a big argument over whose prostate was larger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This campaign is kind of fascinating, because the three major candidates have to be very careful when they criticize each other. Like, you can't criticize Hillary. Ooh, that's sexism. You can't criticize Barack. Ooh, that's racism. And you can't go after McCain, because that's elder abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is now pushing Congress to expand the government's ability to spy on Americans now that the current phone tap bill has expired. ... In fact, to gain support for a new spying Bill, they're bringing in coach Bill Belichick. Yeah. They are going to rename it the New England Patriot Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is now in Africa, where he's meeting with several of Africa's top leaders. See, again, I don't think President Bush is that familiar with Africa. Like, today, he said the leader he's most looking forward to meeting -- the Lion King.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is a horrible story. Terrorists in Afghanistan put a suicide bomber in a crowd of people watching a dogfight. Wow, that sounds like Michael Vick's worst nightmare, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know, terrorists blowing up people watching a dogfight. I'm sorry, who do you root for there, really?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon is now planning to shoot down a broken satellite that's falling to Earth. The satellite is the size of a school bus, and they want to blow it up before it hits us. Yeah. In fact the actual plan, they're going to have Roger Clemens throw a second school bus at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, HGH is not illegal, but Congress is deeply opposed to human growth hormones because they remember what it did to Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as many as 80% of the school districts all across the country are seeing if they need to throw out millions of pounds of school lunches made from that tainted California beef, the largest beef recall in history. The other 20% announced that tomorrow will be Sloppy Joe Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to new research, the Hispanic population in the United States will triple by the year 2050.&quot; The year &quot;2050? I think it's going to triple by Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new study tracking these population trends, it said by the year 2050, white people will be the minority in the United States, except at NASCAR races.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out in California they found out that something was haywire with the beef,&quot; so they &quot;recalled, listen to this, 143 million pounds of tainted beef. ... That is one triple stack burger at Wendy's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend. Barack Obama and John Edwards got together and Edwards may endorse Obama, although his hair is still leaning toward Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain...seems reinvigorated, doesn't he? And he has a brand-new campaign slogan. It's 'He'll lead you into the 21st century.' And I like it better than the old slogan, which was 'He'll lead you into assisted living.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I like John McCain. He looks like an old guy in a coffee shop who is still complaining about the designated hitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who asked the driver if he is on the right bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;He looks like the guy who is always saying, 'What was that? Nothing? That's what I thought.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a big campaign scandal brewing. I don't know if you've heard about this, but Hillary Clinton's campaign is accusing Barack Obama of plagiarizing a speech by the governor of Massachusetts. Yeah. Yeah, and they may have a point because Barack's speech was entitled, 'I Love Chowda.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Africa right now. Yeah. President Bush met the President of Tanzania yesterday, and he gave him a pair of Shaquille O'Neal sneakers. That's true. ... That's not the joke part, yeah.&quot; So, &quot;the president of Tanzania was thrilled and plans to use Shaq's shoes as a house for hundreds of his people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an announcement to make before I begin the show. When I leave the show, my younger brother, Raul Leno, will be taking over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know that Fidel Castro resigned today as president of Cuba. But don't worry; you'll still be able to see him on ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God, he ran Cuba for almost 50 years. The political analysts are now debating what kind of changes the Cuban people will hope for. I'm going to guess maybe term limits?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you realize when Castro came to power in 1959, John McCain was only 61 years old?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Fidel Castro was the most powerful socialist in the world not living in Malibu. Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations to the new nation of Kosovo. They gained their independence this week,&quot; and, &quot;of course, President Bush was shocked when he heard this. He said, 'Independence? We haven't even invaded them yet!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is in Africa this week. Again, I don't think he really understands the African nations. Like today, they asked if he was looking forward to seeing Rwanda. He said, 'You mean my secretary of state?' They said, 'No, that's Condoleezza. Rwanda is a country.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Wall Street Journal' reports this week that the candy industry is so worried about falling candy sales, they're now adding caffeine to the candy. Well, that's every parent's worst nightmare, huh? A fat kid that's up all night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Fidel Castro Is Retiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. He has accepted the role of Dr. Ramon Vazquez on 'General Hospital.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Achieved his goal of getting Cuba's unemployment rate under 83%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Wants to spend more time interrogating his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Just got Season One of 'Gilmore Girls.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Caught injecting human growth hormone into his wife, Debbie Castro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Too many tacos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. He was adopted by Angelina Jolie -- honestly, how crazy would that be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Always promised himself he'd quit torturing when it stopped being fun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Jane Fonda called him a blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Forty-nine years at the same job? Who am I, Letterman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's some sad news coming from Havana, ladies and gentlemen. Fidel Castro has resigned. A lot of people thought it was because of his health,&quot; but Castro is actually &quot;resigning because he wants to spend more time with his beard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castro's &quot;retirement will not change the relationship Cuba has with the United States. Cubans still will not legally be allowed to enter the United States unless they have an overpowering fastball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts believe that now that he has resigned,&quot; Castro &quot;will either be succeeded by his brother, Raul, or by his idiot son, Fidel W. Castro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the primary in Wisconsin? Hillary Clinton is desperate to win in Wisconsin. As a matter of fact, today, she was campaigning wearing a cheese pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think the pressure is getting to the Clintons and the Clinton campaign. In Wisconsin, earlier today, Bill...got into a screaming match with a cow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this John McCain? Whoa! My gosh. Doesn't he look like the old guy at the barber shop?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks kind of like a Wal-Mart greeter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is &quot;the guy who is always early for the early bird special, that's what he looks like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot; he looks like a mall walker, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy at the supermarket who is confused by the automatic doors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the uncle who pretends to remove his thumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro announced that he is stepping down, ending five decades of rule. ... But the biggest...surprise was when Castro announced that he's going to retire in Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you notice, President Bush is in Africa this week? And...yesterday, true story, he visited a school and read to the students from 'The Cat in the Hat.' Yeah. There was an awkward moment when one of the students told Bush, 'Sir, this is a college.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The founders of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream are endorsing Barack Obama instead of Hillary Clinton,&quot; which &quot;makes sense...because 'Baracky Road' is a catchier name for an ice cream than 'Pantsuits and Cream.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Spice Girls...say they want to play at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday party. Yeah. When he heard this, Mandela said, 'Thanks, but I'd rather go back to prison.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain...has unveiled a new campaign slogan ? 'Ready To Lead America Into The 21st Century.' Yeah, yeah. And this is a lot better than his old slogan, 'I've Been Around Since The 19th Century.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fidel Castro &quot;is finally stepping down. ... It is about time Castro retired. He is almost 81 years old. That is almost as old as John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Black History Month,&quot; and &quot;if Barack Obama keeps winning, it looks like Hillary could be history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, last night, Barack Obama won two more states. That makes ten in a row. ... She loses one more,&quot; and &quot;she's going to be signed by LA Clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mike Huckabee's campaign starting to taper off. ... Like at the big rallies now, Chuck Norris just sends a stunt double.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on this week on ABC, John McCain said, 'no new taxes.' You know who else said 'no new taxes?' Wesley Snipes: 'No new taxes, please!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over in Africa, President Bush is being welcomed as a hero in Tanzania. Yeah. That's because President Bush always said, 'One day, Third World countries would have the same economy as the United States.' Thanks to his economic plan, now they do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fidel Castro has resigned as president of Cuba. ... Hey, he always said he would quit being a dictator when it wasn't fun anymore. You know. I guess the heartlessness just wasn't in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell Castro's getting old. Like, now, when he wears the fatigues, he's got the white belt and the matching shoes to go with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon is going to shoot down this satellite...that's about to crash to Earth. ... They're going to shoot it out of the sky with a missile. Here's my question -- what if they miss? Won't the missile fall to Earth too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they're shooting it off an aircraft carrier, and bad weather in the Pacific may force the Navy to wait another day to shoot down this satellite. The military says if this mission is a success, it will send a message to our enemies that we can deal with any attack, as long as it's in good weather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Hillary Clinton campaign? You know, they're...worried and a little bit nervous. They're campaigning in Texas today. To give you an idea how nervous Hillary is, she showed up in a pantsuit and chaps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week in Wisconsin, she showed up in a cheese pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, there's already trouble down there in Texas in the primary. Bill, of course, got into a shouting match with an oil well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the United States military is thinking about shooting down Hillary's campaign before it falls to Earth and hurts somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that John McCain, though? ... He looks like the guy in front of you at the movies whose wife has to repeat everything, doesn't he, a little bit?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who has to always be told something's on his chin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who still has a rotary phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who backed over his own mailbox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy that always tells you he's '72 years young.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who brags oatmeal has lowered his cholesterol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who should be co-hosting with Kelly Ripa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Senator Barack Obama won the Wisconsin Democratic primary,&quot; which &quot;makes Obama the first black man to ever win a primary in Wisconsin and the first black man to ever go to Wisconsin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The band Abba wants John McCain to stop using their songs at his campaign rallies. Yeah. When asked about it, McCain said, 'Who cares about Abba? Kids today are into the Bee Gees.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fidel Castro's stepping down as the leader of Cuba. He'll be replaced by his brother, Raul. It's true, yeah. According to the State Department, 'Raul Castro is the Jim Belushi of Central America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to blow up that defective spy satellite tonight. His plan, I guess, is to blow up one satellite every month until he leaves office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our President, George W. Bush, is in Africa right now. He's trying to use up the frequent flyer miles before he leaves office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out that unlike everywhere else in the world, President Bush is very popular in Africa. They really love him. A lot of it is because he's committed a lot of financial aid to fight AIDS and malaria. A lot of it is because he brings candy wherever he goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton still doing very well in one state -- the state of denial, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, after winning ten in a row, political experts say there's a very good chance that Barack Obama could end up as our next president. See, that shows you the progress we've made in this country. We can have a black man in the White House. I remember when we couldn't get a black man in the cast of 'Friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while he was in Africa, President Bush visited a school in Tanzania, and read to the students from 'The Cat in the Hat.' It was very moving&quot; when &quot;the small children helped President Bush pronounce some of the harder words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today in Afghanistan, a helicopter carrying three US senators had to make an emergency landing because of bad weather. All three senators are okay. Wasn't that the plot of the last 'Rambo' movie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, in the helicopter were Senators Chuck Hagel, Joe Biden, and John Kerry. See, they are part of our new military offensive against Al Qaeda, Operation Bore Them To Death. They give speeches, the people fall asleep; we attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Cuba, Fidel Castro has resigned, and people in Miami haven't been this excited since the Dolphins stopped playing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hard to believe Fidel Castro is gone. See? So, the embargo worked; 49 years later, he is out of there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, to mark the end of his almost 50 years in power, the Cuban people today gave Fidel Castro a golden raft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to 'Forbes' magazine, Fidel Castro is one of the world's richest men. He has almost a billion dollars,&quot; which could explain why &quot;he spent the whole day fending off calls from Heather Mills. 'No, I don't want a date. No, I'm sorry.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists now believe that a child's intellectual power, a child's brain power, a child's IQ, is inherited solely from the mother. All the intelligence of a child comes from the mother. These findings are based on the study of the Bush twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you read about John McCain? Well, according to 'The New York Times,' John McCain may have had an inappropriate relationship with a young blonde. That sounds like presidential material to me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like that John McCain. He looks like a guy who gets ticketed for mowing under the influence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like a guy with a collection of movies he bought at the car wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like a guy on the beach with a metal detector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who is still confused by the phone answering machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who calls his grandson when he screws up the remote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After more than a year of delays, Southern Methodist University and President Bush have finally agreed to the terms for building his presidential library on the SMU campus. ... SMU promised to build the library, and President Bush promised to stop calling the school 'SMOO.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a very tough day for John McCain with the 'New York Times' allegation that he had an affair.&quot; The paper &quot;is saying McCain had an affair, years ago, with Joan of Arc or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big story in 'The New York Times' today about Senator John McCain, who's running for president. It questioned his ties to a lobbyist named...Vicki Iseman.&quot; The story &quot;hinted&quot; that McCain &quot;may have had an extramarital affair with her,&quot; but &quot;the weird thing is she looks almost exactly like John McCain's wife, Cindy.&quot; So &quot;he might have just got confused and grabbed the wrong woman. These two look more alike than the Olson twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if anything happened or not, but I think the rule of thumb should be every year you're in a Vietnamese prison camp, you should be allowed one extramarital affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now that he is the Republican front-runner, it looks like John McCain has changed his position on torture. He's now in favor of waterboarding, but only in very limited cases -- like if you're editor of 'The New York Times.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard this story by now. 'The New York Times' 'alleging' that John McCain had an inappropriate relationship with a young female lobbyist. I haven't seen McCain this angry since 'Matlock' was canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this woman traveled around with McCain on his campaign stops, and she also flew aboard his private jet. Do you know what you call a young woman traveling around with a 71-year-old man? A nurse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, John McCain said yesterday he was disappointed with the story. His friend, Rudy Giuliani, said he was very upset by the story. I tell you, you know who was really angry? Mitt Romney. He said, 'Why couldn't this have happened two weeks ago?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of people are questioning the source of this 'New York Times' story. See, it's never good when an article begins, 'Dude, guess what I heard.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is back from Africa. You know, he was hoping to go on a safari, but he never got the chance. See, I don't think President Bush really understands Africa, you know? Like he said the reason he always wanted to go on a safari was, he always wanted to see a unicorn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the head of the International Obesity Task Force says that the problem of overeating should be dealt with the same way we deal with global warming. Well, that's perfect. Al Gore could be spokesman for both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Disneyland announced this week they're bringing back the House of the Future attraction at Disney. ... To give you an idea how realistic it is, the bank actually forecloses on it; then it's repossessed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news, of course this week, President George Bush was in Africa,&quot; where &quot;he's wildly popular.&quot; That is like David Hasselhoff being popular &quot;in Germany. Nobody knows why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, footage surfaced of Senator Ted Kennedy singing in Spanish to a Latino group. ... Yeah, there was an awkward moment when someone in the crowd pointed at Kennedy's head and said, 'Look, the pi?ata is singing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police in Maryland found more than $1 million worth of marijuana in a car parked just outside of 7-Eleven. ... Yeah, police became suspicious when they saw the owner of the car eat a 7-Eleven hot dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing? All the acting Oscars went to foreigners. Foreigners won everything. In fact, today, Lou Dobbs called for a ten-foot fence to be built around Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in political news, Ralph Nader has decided to run for president! Well, you thought Mike Huckabee didn't know when to quit, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you call somebody at a Ralph Nader campaign rally? Ralph Nader. That's the only one there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader &quot;is going to be 74 next week. In fact, the good news, if Ralph gets sick, his younger brother, Raul Nader, will then take over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know who's thrilled that Nader is back in the race? John McCain. He's not the oldest guy anymore. There you go. Hey, congratulations!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama made another woman faint today. The bad news, it was Hillary when she saw the poll numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Could be problems for Hillary Clinton. Apparently, there are 14 states to go, and she only has 12 pantsuits left, so it's going to be neck and neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is exciting news. Southern Methodist University announced that they will be the home of George W. Bush's presidential library. ... This will be the first presidential library to be made up entirely of small, shiny objects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, I understand right now, they're building a shelf for the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the Department of Homeland Security, a high-tech virtual fence on part of our border with Mexico is finally ready to serve. ... You know how a virtual fence works? Anybody know? It lets virtually anybody through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, ladies and gentlemen. Barack Obama says he has a plan for getting us out of the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things getting nasty now between the Clinton and Obama campaigns. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Ralph Nader announced he's running for president again. ... Yeah, immediately after the announcement, the guy sitting next to Nader on the park bench told him to shut up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, Fidel Castro, who is 81 years old,&quot; resigned &quot;from the presidency of Cuba and was replaced by his brother Raul, who is 76. Yeah, afterwards, Castro said, 'I wanted to give the kid a chance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a shocking story. You see this on the news last night? Politics, people get so worked up. A man in Pennsylvania stabbed his brother-in-law in the stomach with a knife after they got into a fight over who was a better candidate, Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. ... Don't confuse that with Hillary and Barack. They keep stabbing each other in the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate...Chris Dodd of Connecticut has given his endorsement to Barack Obama. Wow! You know what that means? Dozens of votes for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today that he is very concerned about the acceleration of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia. See, again, I don't think President Bush is really familiar with this region of the world. Like, he said today that 'violence in Serbia could spread to suburbia and claim the lives of millions of suburbanites.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a massive power outage hit south Florida today, leaving millions of people without electricity. ... A lot of people in Miami felt they were back in Cuba again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess every Starbucks in the country closed today for three hours. ... Three hours without Starbucks. Luckily, the President signed a bill allowing to us tap into our strategic coffee reserves.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British scientists are now conducting new tests on the Shroud of Turin. ... They're trying to pinpoint exactly how old it is. They say if these tests are successful, one day they might be able too determine the exact age of John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ralph Nader Campaign Promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Fund universal health care by making Wesley Snipes pay his taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Give the presidency a rumpled, Walter Matthau quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The freezing over of Hell should solve our global warming crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Get those people off that island in 'Lost.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Send Gary Busey in to annoy and confuse our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Can fill out a pantsuit better than Hillary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Will hover in polls between 1% and 'Statistically Insignificant.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Force Starbucks to identify their sizes 'Small,' 'Medium,' and 'Large' -- am I right people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Will not sleep with lobbyists, or for that matter anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Get Bush re-elected like in 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader is running for president. I'm like you. I think this really could be Ralph's year. I like Ralph Nader. He looks like a guy who comes into town once a year for supplies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader &quot;looks like a guy you would see sitting on his front porch watching for out-of-plate states.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But seriously, how about that John McCain, huh? John McCain looks like a guy whose head you can barely see over the steering wheel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain looks like the guy who thinks the nurses are stealing his stuff. 'Dad, why would they take your socks? It doesn't make sense.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, another big Democratic debate in Ohio. And the format for this one was a little different. Both candidates were sitting on dunk tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight in Cleveland, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are debating one another for the 20th time. Yeah, experts...are calling it 'redundant, unnecessary, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in Cleveland.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, someone released a photo of Barack Obama wearing a traditional African dress. Yeah. Yeah, as a result, Barack has been offered a starring role in 'Big Momma's House 3.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader announced he's once again going to run for president. Yeah. Yeah, Nader says he's running, because he's tired of Mike Huckabee stealing all the 'no chance in hell' votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has announced it's going to pull all their TV ads featuring Dr. Robert Jarvik. As it turns out, Jarvik is not licensed to practice medicine. ... This whole scandal must scare the hell out of Dr. Scholl's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this new poll, political thing, Hillary's lead in Ohio is slipping, which I was very surprised about. When I heard a presidential candidate slipped, I was thinking, it's John McCain, obviously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From 5:30 until 8:30 this evening, every Starbucks in the country was closed. ... Fortunately, President Bush...gave FEMA authorization to tap into our nation's emergency mochachino reserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama faced off again tonight in Cleveland for their final debate before the...primaries on March 4 in Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had another Democratic debate last night. This time it was in Ohio. The big winner, of course, Fox's 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they're saying this is the biggest thing to happen in Cleveland since -- ever, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Obama and Hillary argued last night over which candidate the Republicans are most afraid of. Interesting. I don't want to take sides here, but I think it's pretty obvious which candidate Republicans are most afraid of -- John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader announced he's running for president. ... Nader says his reason for running is that he spent over 40 years as a consumer advocate. You'd think after 40 years of studying customers' wants and needs, he'd realize consumers don't want or need him now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And experts say Cuba's new communist leader,&quot; Raul Castro, &quot;is more progressive than his brother, Fidel. In fact, in his acceptance speech, he pledged to lead Cuba into the year 1960.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Florida officials are still in a panic over yesterday's big power outage. ... They were on the phone today with President Bush, telling him, 'We know! It wasn't supposed to happen until election day. We don't know what happened.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, according to a health report this week, obesity is more dangerous than terrorism. Yeah, in fact, to help fight obesity, President Bush announced today he's going to start bombing Hometown Buffets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton now is trailing Barack Obama, and she's very desperate. ... She's starting to get desperate. Today, she accused Barack Obama of attending a party at Jose Canseco's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader is running for president,&quot; and he &quot;is 74 years old today. So happy birthday to Ralph Nader! ... No, wait a minute; 74 is how many votes he'll get. I'm sorry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Ralph Nader, ladies and gentlemen. He looks like the night manager of a creepy motel, doesn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader &quot;looks like a guy at a gas station who gives you bad directions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you guys think about John McCain? How about John McCain? He...looks like a guy at a restaurant that says, 'I'm leaving 10%. That's good enough.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy that goes to the curb for the paper and locks himself outside of the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader &quot;looks like the guy who can't find his table after he goes to the salad bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night was the final Democratic debate,&quot; and one &quot;of the big stories was that Barack Obama&quot; mispronounced &quot;the word 'Massachusetts' twice and then mispronounced the word 'filibuster.' Yeah. Yeah, which explains why this morning, Obama was endorsed by President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this is depressing. Oil is now over $100 a barrel. Experts say gas could reach $4 a gallon, yeah. I believe the experts are named Bush and Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, you know, I don't think President Bush really understands the impact this has on the average American. Like, today, when they told him people would be paying $4 a gallon, he said, 'Why don't folks just buy half a gallon? And then with the money you save, you could buy the other gallon. You see what I'm saying?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The New York Times,' even though both of John McCain's parents are American citizens that were serving in the armed forces at the time, there could be a constitutional argument that he can't be president because he wasn't born in this country. He was born in Panama. ... Well, now they're questioning if Ralph Nader is eligible, because it turns out he does not appear to be born on planet Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, folks, the big news, Ralph Nader has chosen his running mate for president. You know who he picked? Matt Gonzalez,&quot; the &quot;only guy that showed up at...Nader's campaign rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prince Harry&quot; is &quot;in Afghanistan on the front line.&quot; This has &quot;been a huge secret. ... Of course, President Bush was stunned when he heard this, and he said, 'His dad couldn't get him out of it? What?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is down there campaigning in Texas. She is a little nervous, doing everything she can, pulling out all the stops in Texas today. She was campaigning in a raw hide pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And how about Ralph Nader, running for president? I like Ralph Nader. He looks like the doctor you go to and have the bullet removed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader looks like an accountant for a small town circus, really, when you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then of course you have John McCain. I like John McCain. He looks like the guy whose daughter takes him to the mall once a year for new Rockports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you know, I was thinking about Ralph Nader. Now here's what Ralph Nader looks like. He looks like the guy that gets up every day early to check his traps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain, on the other hand, he looks like&quot; the &quot;kind of guy who uses the word 'my' a lot, you know? Like, 'Well, I get up and I have my coffee. Then I read my paper. Then I have my oatmeal. And then I take my nap.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no, Ralph Nader, have you seen him lately? He looks like the kind of a guy that'd be the night manager of a big box store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ralph Nader looks like the guy that'd be forced to cut a diamond for the mob.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I like John McCain. Did I mention that?&quot; McCain &quot;looks like the kind of guy who goes to the post office and asks for the new Gerald Ford stamp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain looks like the guy standing in the grocery store aisle comparing high fiber cereals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Times' just reported that John McCain may be constitutionally barred from becoming president because he was born outside the United States in the Panama Canal Zone. Yeah. Yeah, when he heard this, McCain said, 'That's ridiculous. When I was born, there was no Panama Canal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Third-party presidential candidate Ralph Nader announced that his running mate is going to be a former city supervisor of San Francisco, Matt Gonzalez. ... This bold move will insure that Nader gets the vote of Matt Gonzalez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a press conference today, President Bush said the following. He said it's important we make the economy stronger so 'families can put money on their tables.' Yes, then Bush said that Americans 'should deposit food in their bank accounts.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain...might not be eligible to run for the presidency because he was born outside of America. ... Now, I actually think this is unfair,&quot; because when &quot;McCain was born, technically, America hadn't been discovered yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Leap Year! This is February 29th. How about that? In fact, when President Bush heard that, he said, 'Remember, turn your clocks ahead one year, everybody.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a press conference today, President Bush announced America is not headed into a recession, especially if you own an oil company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;High gas prices leave a bad taste in people's mouths. Have you noticed that? That's mostly from the siphoning, but still, it's a horror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, gas is so expensive in LA, now when you call 911, they ask you to meet the ambulance halfway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Bush said that last year an intelligence gap opened up. Last year? Gee, didn't that open up about 2001, right after the inauguration?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just 48 hours after Homeland Security officials told Congress a 28-mile long virtual fence along the US-Mexican border was working, they now say it will be delayed three years because they can't get the video surveillance to work. ... Isn't that amazing? Do you realize, Homeland Security has less video surveillance than the New England Patriots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in movie news, the movie 'Panic Room 2' is now in development. The whole thing's going to be filmed at Hillary Clinton's campaign headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more problems with John McCain. 'The New York Times' is now saying there is a question as to whether McCain is eligible to become president because he was born in Panama. See, his parents were in the military, so he was born in Panama. In fact, the reason they moved away from Panama, the building of the canal was keeping the young John McCain up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I don't want to say McCain is old, but yesterday he accidentally got on the wrong bus, ended up taking a gambling junket to Atlantic City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, everyone is so concerned now, where all the candidates were born. You know, McCain was born on a military base in Panama, Hillary was born outside Chicago, and if you believe the media, Barack Obama was born in a manger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the world of John McCain. He looks like the kind of guy who still talks real loud on a long-distance phone call.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy you are waiting for to stop gabbing with the teller, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like a guy who sits at his dinner tray and watches 'The Beltway Boys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy whose wife forced him to go on a cruise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy you have to nudge when his name is called.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like a freelance crosswalk guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts are saying that Barack Obama, if he's the nominee, should choose...a running mate who is older, a veteran, and from a different part of the country. ... Yeah, so today, Obama chose John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said he won't stay in the race 'beyond reason.' Yeah. Then Huckabee announced he's dropping out six weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the US Border Patrol arrested a man responsible for smuggling thousands of Guatemalans into California. ... Yeah, an angry American official said those Guatemalans were taking jobs that should have gone to Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said that she raised $35 million in the month of February, which is fantastic. Now she can afford a really nice vacation as soon as she drops out of the race.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like John McCain clinched the nomination earlier this evening. He was very excited when they woke him up to tell him.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had primaries in Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island, and Vermont tonight. Many people...waited until the very last minute to decide who they're going to support. According to the exit polls, 53% of the voters still hadn't made up their mind, even after they voted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess...Clinton won Rhode Island, which is a tiny little state. It's only the size of a head of a pin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is not going to quit though, even if she loses tonight. She told her supporters tonight, &quot;If we pull out now, the guy I tried to make look like a terrorist wins.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the Republican side, no surprise, John McCain won enough delegates to score the...nomination.&quot; McCain's opponent, Mike Huckabee, &quot;dropped out the race tonight, this despite his high-profile appearance on 'Tyra' Friday. I thought that was going to do it for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess once Oprah anointed Obama, everybody else headed for Tyra Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you all remember daylight saving time? ... Spring forward, fall back? Kind of like Hillary in the primaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they said on the news today neither Barack nor Hillary can win the nomination outright, because they're so close. So, Hillary is kind of caught between Barack and a hard place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that amazing? Technically neither of them can win. That shows how bad it's gotten for the Democrats. Forget wining the general election, they can't even win their own elections now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, there's talk in some Democratic circles of letting the states of Michigan and Florida revote. Today, Al Gore said, 'Oh, now you think of this! Great!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they're talking about a revote primary where people would mail in their ballots. Oh, that's a great idea. So, you'd combine the reliability of people in Florida who count the ballots with the efficiency of the Post Office. What could go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Pakistan, the newly elected opponents of President Musharraf...say they're ready to cut back on his power and put the country back on the road to democracy. And today, President Bush said, 'Well, something like that couldn't happen here, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the big economic news. They're predicting $4 a gallon gasoline by springtime. Let me put that in perspective for people who live in LA because people here, they don't live in the real world. You know what that's like? That means it would cost you 15 Starbuck lattes to fill up your car. Okay? See, that's when it hits home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today they asked Dick Cheney if the price of gasoline could reach as high as $5 a gallon. He said, 'Yes, if there is a God in heaven.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But God bless him, President Bush says we are not in a recession. By we, he means himself and the board of Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's still insisting we're not in a recession. I don't know. I mean, gas is closing on four bucks a gallon, you can't afford to drive to the job you're about to lose to pay for the house you can't live in anymore. Isn't that pretty the recession trifecta right there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But hey, here is a...wonderful story. Last week, Frank Buckles, the oldest living American World War I veteran, 107 years old,&quot; visited &quot;the White House and met with President Bush. Yeah. The sad part, after the meeting, Bush sent him to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Past couple of days ? you've all heard about this -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain have all claimed that they are the person who should answer the phone at the White House if it rings at 3:00 a.m.,&quot; but &quot;most Americans think the White House should just get a receptionist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer has admitted that he was involved in a prostitution ring. ... You know, this is the most embarrassing thing to happen to a governor, I guess, since Arnold Schwarzenegger did 'Kindergarten Cop.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, one of the reasons the governor of New York got caught...on a wiretap&quot; is because &quot;his voice is very distinctive, and they recognized his voice. ... Boy, how easy would it be to catch&quot; Gov. Schwarzenegger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has been hinting that she and Barack Obama might share the Democratic ticket, with her in the number one position. She feels Barack Obama deserves some sort of consolation prize for getting the most votes and being the most popular.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's a very scary story. Prescription medications have been discovered in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans.&quot; President Bush &quot;calls that the Republican healthcare plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, track and field legend Marion Jones began serving a six-month prison sentence for lying to the government about using steroids. And today, Roger Clemens said, 'You can't go to jail for that, can you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Messages Left On Eliot Spitzer's Answering Machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. 'Hey, what's new?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. 'It's Barack Obama. Remember our conversation about being my running mate? Never mind.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. 'Ralph Nader here. Glad to hear I'm not the only politician who has to pay for it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 'Hi, I'm calling from the 'New York Post.' Would you rather be known as 'Disgraced Governor Perv' or 'Humiliated Whore Fiend'?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 'This is John McCain. If it makes you feel any better, I once got caught having sex with Lincoln's wife.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. 'It's Dr. Phil. Call me if you need any horse@#*@ advice.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'This is Senator Larry Craig. Do you ever go through the Minneapolis Airport?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'It's Wolf Blitzer. Call me if you ever want to have a hot Spitzer-Blitzer three-way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Paris Hilton here. I would have done it for free.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'It's Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thanks, I'm no longer America's creepiest governor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so sunny and bright outside that earlier today, Eliot Spitzer came out of a brothel squinting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess everybody knows about this by now. New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer caught with a high-priced call girl. Ladies and gentlemen, there but for a declined MasterCard go I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, Spitzer, now, listen to this. Spitzer was told about the evidence against him on Friday,&quot; and &quot;I'm thinking, wow, somebody had a worse weekend than I did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spitzer, &quot;a regular customer&quot; of the call girls, &quot;was known as client 9. It looks now like client 9 will soon be looking for wife number 2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm a half full kind of guy. I always try to positive spin on stuff. Sure, it's a horrible story. On the other hand,&quot; Spitzer &quot;was supporting New York's number one industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Times' reported that New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer was a customer of a high-end prostitution ring,&quot; and &quot;Republicans in New York...have given Gov. Spitzer an ultimatum that if he doesn't resign, they'll push for impeachment.&quot; Gov. Spitzer &quot;responded by saying, 'How about you just thank me, we'll call it even?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, good evening. I'm Jay Leno, or, as the girls at the Emperor's Club call me, 'client number eight.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, earlier today,&quot; New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned. During his resignation speech, &quot;Spitzer only spoke for 2 minutes and 40 seconds,&quot; but &quot;he still had to pay for the entire hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People treat you differently when you're no longer powerful. Like today,&quot; Spitzer &quot;went from client number 9 to client number 3,252.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more and more details are coming out about this incident,&quot; and it seems Spitzer &quot;was caught on a Federal wiretap making arrangements to meet with this prostitute. See, that's why the Democrats are against Bush's eavesdropping policy. You see? Bush is not only catching terrorists, he's catching Democrats too now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the FBI said they became suspicious after tracking what they call 'questionable transfers of money' from Spitzer's account. See, at first they thought he was hiding bribe money, and then they realized it's highly unlikely that the governor would be bribed by a woman named 'Cindy Candypants.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Barack Obama, who won again last night. He beat Hillary in Mississippi&quot; with &quot;60% of the vote. In fact, he won by such a wide margin, Hillary is now definitely going to offer him the number two spot on the ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Barack called Hillary last night to tell her that he won at 3:00 a.m. in the morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw 'Clueless' on TV last night. Geraldine Ferraro? Anybody see that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Geraldine Ferraro was forced to leave the Clinton campaign after saying that the only reason Barack Obama is winning is because he's black. And you know, hey, there's some truth to that. The only way you're going to get elected president in this country is if you're a black guy. A rich old white guy? How many of those have we had? Huh? It's almost impossible!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And democratic officials in Florida and Michigan are talking about doing a re-vote. They want people to vote again in those primaries. In fact, Florida officials have been scrambling to reprogram their voting machines, because most of them are still wired to pick George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who's going to run for congress? Jack Kevorkian. Remember him? The suicide doctor?&quot; Kervorkian is &quot;79 years old, and he's going to run for Congress. See, there's a term limit proposal everybody could get behind. See what I'm saying? Just have the politicians kill themselves. Fabulous!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And track star Marion Jones has begun serving her six-month sentence for lying about steroid use. And they have her at a minimum-security prison, which makes no sense to me. I mean, let's say she decides to run. Who's going to catch her?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Surprises During Eliot Spitzer's Resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Entered to the sounds of Jay-Z's 'Big Pimpin.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Opening line: 'Are you a cop?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Spent a few awkward moments seductively stroking the microphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Reaffirmed his policy of 'bro's before ho's.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. His decision not to wear pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Admitted he also once made out with former Governor Pataki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Credited downfall to fast-paced lifestyle of Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. He was kinda pitchy, dawg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Said he thought the Emperor's Club was a Chinese restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When reporters asked how much he paid per hour, his wife said, 'Believe me, he doesn't need an hour.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard the big news. Governor Eliot Spitzer, governor of New York, resigned today. Yup. He left his resignation on the night table with a $300 tip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He waited about the resignation and finally he had to. He couldn't get a pardon from Oprah, so he's gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this is a big story,&quot; with &quot;a lot of polling. Listen to this. Four out of five New Yorkers wanted him to go. ... Myself and the writers, we, of course, wanted him to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there's a...very somber mood here in New York City. ... As a matter of fact, even the hookers in Times Square were wearing the black armbands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here's the deal. Now Spitzer will have to pay women to call him Governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how politics works, you know. Eliot Spitzer was a Hillary Clinton superdelegate. Do you know what that means? Neither do I. But he was Hillary Clinton's superdelegate, and also Spitzer was on Hillary Clinton's...possible vice president list. ... Boy, she can pick 'em, can't she?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York's governor, Eliot Spitzer, resigned today. And to make things official, Governor Spitzer had to write a letter of resignation to New York's secretary of state. ... Out of habit, Spitzer addressed the letter, 'Dear Penthouse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential candidate John McCain is in the news&quot; because he is &quot;trying to find a vice presidential running mate. Yeah. Not only that, McCain is also trying to find his reading glasses and his car keys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other major scandal we're covering at this hour,&quot; former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, &quot;who got caught up in a high-end prostitution ring, announced his resignation today. Now they're saying he may have spent $80,000 over prostitutes over the last ten years. Is that a lot? I mean, if you do the math, it's only $22 a day,&quot; and &quot;I spend that on Direct TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spitzer &quot;held another press conference&quot; today and he &quot;said he needed to leave office to begin the difficult process of healing. Not emotional healing, his wife hit him in the face with a George Foreman Grill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, the lieutenant governor will take over. His name is David Paterson. He's African-American and legally blind. He'll be the first blind governor in the United States, and he's already announced that his top legislative priority will be the death penalty for people who don't clean up after their dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The name of the escort service the governor used was the Emperor's Club,&quot; and on the service's website, &quot;they rank the girls from one to seven diamonds. ... The diamonds represent how many you have to buy for your wife after you get caught.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI said it became suspicious after tracking questionable financial transactions from Spitzer's account. ... Let that be a lesson to every politician out there thinking of going to a hooker. Pay cash. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, they said, Eliot Spitzer may have spent as much as $80,000 on prostitutes,&quot; but &quot;think about this. With the stock market going down, real estate market's crashing -- he got a better return than most guys on his money, didn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest rumor is that Eliot Spitzer has reportedly hired one of these top-notch criminal defense law firms in anticipation of possible charges. And here's the ironic part, even they don't charge $5,000 an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's turn to sports. The NBA's Houston Rockets won their 20th game in a row. And today, Geraldine Ferraro said, the only reason they are winning is because they're black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Geraldine Ferraro has resigned from Hillary Clinton's campaign after saying that Barack Obama wouldn't be where he is now if he was white. Yeah. Now, I don't want to see Ferraro was being racially insensitive, but I understand even Dog the Bounty Hunter is distancing himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mitt Romney has emerged from seclusion to say he's willing to serve as John McCain's vice president. He said he has the one thing McCain is looking for in a vice president, an organ donor card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, listen to this. President Bush sent Dick Cheney over there to help bring down oil prices. Oh, yeah, good luck with that. It's like sending Eliot Spitzer to the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that...Eliot Spitzer? ... He stepped down&quot; as governor of New York and &quot;he apologized yesterday. We don't know what he apologized for. I think...it's probably steroids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prostitute that Eliot Spitzer had his affair with is apparently a young woman from New Jersey. Yeah. When asked why she slept with New York's ex-governor, she said, 'Because New Jersey's ex-governor is into guys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out that the call girl linked to Eliot Spitzer is also -- this is true -- an R&amp;B singer. And she said in an interview that her latest song was inspired by a guy. ... She didn't say which guy, but the song is called 'Bald, Creepy Governor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you probably know that 'The New York Times' was able to find Kristen, the 22-year-old prostitute&quot; that Eliot Spitzer &quot;allegedly paid $1,000 an hour. Her real name is Ashley Dupre. ... Here's what's going to happen with her. She's going to pose naked for 'Playboy,' she'll do a season of 'Celebrity Apprentice,' maybe a 'Surreal Life,' then she'll top it off by having a baby with Pauly Shore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eliot Spitzer is set to leave office on Monday, which means hooker party at the governor's mansion this weekend!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Governor Eliot Spitzer has resigned. However, his hooker will finish her full term, so that's exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more and more information is starting to come out about the young lady who charged the former governor $5,000 an hour for her services. ... Now, we didn't know anything about this woman,&quot; but &quot;reporters tracked her down in a day and a half. Now, Osama bin Laden, the most famous terrorist&quot; in the world, &quot;we have no idea where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, taking over for Governor Spitzer will be the Lieutenant Governor David Paterson, who is legally blind. ... I don't think President Bush really understands the situation,&quot; because &quot;when he heard 'legally blind,' he said, 'I love that movie!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Geraldine Ferraro has left Hillary Clinton's campaign. ... She's got a new job in radio now. She's the new sidekick for Don Imus. Yeah, that should work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Dr. Jack Kevorkian, remember him, the old suicide doctor? Seventy-nine-years old, planning to run for Congress. ... Wow, talk about a politician with a lot of skeletons in his closet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, with all the bad news about the economy today, John McCain started distancing himself from President Bush. In fact, McCain was running so fast from President Bush, he ran into Barack Obama, who was running from his minister, and Hillary, who was running from Geraldine Ferraro. And they all just collided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see how much the dollar fell again today? In fact, gardeners here in Los Angeles are insisting on being paid in pesos. And those are the Japanese gardeners!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the dollar is so low now all of Eliot Spitzer's hookers demand euros.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a blue-ribbon panel of educators put together by President Bush&quot; has &quot;determined that other countries' kids are better at math because we try to teach our kids too much. Oh, that's the problem? We're teaching them too much. Teach them less and they'll learn more. In fact, don't teach them at all. They could grow up to be President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The drinking water in New York City, have you heard about this? I mean, like we don't have enough problems; 15 different...prescription drugs, in our drinking water.&quot; You &quot;need a doctor's prescription to turn on the faucet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the drugs in the drinking water here in New York City is an anti-anxiety drug. Well, you know, that makes perfect sense. You've got to have that or we couldn't live here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, things are bad. We've got an unpopular war, we have high energy prices,&quot; and &quot;a slumping economy. I just hope...the President doesn't find out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you think of John McCain? I like John McCain. He looks like the guy at the bakery who doesn't hear his number called.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who likes to watch the plumber work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton says she is the best one qualified to answer the phone at 3:00 a.m. ... And not only that, Hillary says that she will slide down a fireman's pole into a paint suit. At 3:00 a.m.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, I guess, President Bush gave an optimistic speech about the economy, even though the dollar fell even more, oil hit record highs and jobs continue to be lost. Yeah. So when asked what part of the economy is working, Bush said, 'Hookers are doing well.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'New York Times,' this is the latest -- prosecutors suspect that Governor Eliot Spitzer may have used money from his campaign fund to pay for his prostitute. ... Yeah, when reached for comment, Spitzer said, 'To be fair, I did get her vote.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon just published a report...that officially confirms that there was never any link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. ... The report is entitled, 'Oops, Our Bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Border Patrol says that an increasing number of Mexicans are trying to get into America by boat. Yeah. Yeah, they say the hard part is getting the boat over the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Forest Service says that marijuana plants are spreading through California's national forests, and soon marijuana will cover over 6,000 acres of public land. ... Even better, the Grand Canyon is slowly filling with tequila.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush this morning gave a speech at the Economic Club of New York. That sounds like a fun club to be a part of, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush &quot;urged the businessmen and women in the audience not to overreact. And if you've ever seen the footage of him reading to the children on 9/11, you know one thing this guy doesn't do is overreact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush &quot;also said that if you look at the numbers overall, even though things may seem bad right now, they're actually very, very good compared to how they're going to be. So, enjoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One person whose economic outlook is very good is Paul McCartney's soon to be ex-wife, Heather Mills. A British court is set to award her around $50 million in a divorce settlement. They married on June 11, 2002, which means they've been married for 2,100 days; $50 million divided by 2,100 is about $23,810 a day, which breaks down to $992 an hour, which is just about what Eliot Spitzer paid that hooker, so that's a lot&quot; of money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy St. Patrick's Day to everybody! Everybody's wearing green. The only place you didn't see any green today, Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do people... dye their food green&quot; on &quot;St. Patrick's Day? ... You got green doughnuts, green cookies, green bagels,&quot; and &quot;we wonder why we're so fat as Americans, you know. We won't eat any real food that's green, like spinach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and what's going on with Geraldine Ferraro? Did you hear what she said today? Oh, man. She said today, 'The leprechaun wouldn't be in the position he's in if he wasn't green!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;St. Patrick's Day, of course, is the day we celebrate St. Patrick, who drove the snakes from Ireland. Ironically, it also marks the day a hooker drove a governor from office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Spitzer of New York,&quot; who &quot;officially resigned today,&quot; has got more problems, because &quot;they're now saying he spent thousands of dollars on these prostitutes and tried to make it look like a legitimate expense. Yeah, yeah. Like after he had sex with them, he'd make the hooker go out and fix a pothole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now everybody's trying to get an interview with&quot; Ashley Alexandra Dupre, the prostitute &quot;that got caught with the governor. Right now, she said she's going to lay low and focus on her next step, marrying Paul McCartney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the price of gasoline&quot; is &quot;going crazy. In Hawaii, it's now over $4 a gallon,&quot; and, &quot;again, President Bush, I don't think he understands the problem. Like today he says, 'First off, nobody drives to Hawaii.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how high gas prices are, in Beverly Hills, some stations are now selling gas by the carafe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And does anybody have the new redesigned $5 bill? It's out,&quot; and it &quot;has several new features. One of the new features, it's only worth $3.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama is apparently trying to distance himself from his church. And today, Mitt Romney said, 'Hey, good luck with that!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Barack Obama's longtime pastor is raising eyebrows at some of his more outrageous comments,&quot; but Obama &quot;denies being in church when&quot; the pastor &quot;gave these sermons. In fact, Barack is now claiming, 'Look, I'm a Muslim. I was at the mosque. I know nothing about this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And congratulations to our good friend Billy Crystal. You see him play for the Yankees last week? ... He did a great job, nice job. But now, uh-oh, scandal brewing.&quot; The &quot;rumor is he may have taken human growth hormone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel bad when this kind of stuff happens but they were celebrating St. Patrick's Day down in Washington and of course President Bush was so confused. He comes out on the White House lawn and pardons the corned beef.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But how many of you folks go to the St. Patrick's Day parade here in New York City. ... Well, a lot of Irish dignitaries at the parade. You had O'Connor, you had O'Hare, you had Obama -- what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you are aware of this, but tragedy at the St. Patrick's Day parade.&quot; Mayor Bloomberg &quot;was marching in the parade, and he was hit...by a jumping stockbroker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But are you folks worried about the market? ... It dropped another 4,000 points or something today,&quot; but luckily for me, &quot;I'm not in the stock market. Yeah. I have all of my money in a chain of Amy Winehouse hair salons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But President Bush is concerned about the economy. He admitted today that the economy is a little sluggish...right now. Yeah, in the same way Elvis is a little sluggish right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of American dignitaries visiting the Middle East. ... Senator McCain, running for president,&quot; visited Iraq. Of course, &quot;he remembers Iraq when it was known as Mesopotamia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney also paid a surprise visit to Iraq. And Cheney, is very popular in the middle east. I mean he flashes them that nice warm sneer, and they just...go crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in that part of the world,&quot; Cheney &quot;is known as 'Lawrence of Arrhythmia.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Hillary Clinton said that the war would end up costing $1 trillion,&quot; but she &quot;wasn't talking about Iraq. She was talking about her war with Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great day for New York State. They have a new governor today. ... He's legally blind. Wasn't that a movie with Reese Witherspoon?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new governor of New York, he's blind. It is a big improvement because if he's ever caught with a prostitute, he can just say 'Hey, I thought she was my wife.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course everybody knows what happened to Governor Eliot Spitzer. Last week he was caught with a...call girl,&quot; and &quot;I'm watching this thing unfolding on the television last week. I'm witnessing a politician's career go down in flames, and my only thought was this is a tragedy,&quot; a &quot;tragedy that I'm on vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you all ready for 'March Madness'? Well, you know how it works. You start with 64. That goes down to 32, right, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, until there's just one left.&quot; Not NCAA teams, but &quot;brokerage houses on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Bear Stearns? ... Did you hear about this?&quot; A &quot;year ago, it was trading at $160 a share. Yesterday, $2 a share. Collapsed faster than Roger Clemens' Hall of Fame chances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even President Bush is starting to get worried about this economy being out of control, you know. I mean, gold is over $1,000 an ounce. Oil, over $100 a barrel. Hookers, $5,000 an hour. Who can afford this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in New York City yesterday, David Paterson was sworn in as the new governor of New York. He is legally blind, as opposed to outgoing governor, Eliot Spitzer, who is really, really short-sighted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I love this. On his first day, the Governor admitted to having an affair. Actually, having a couple of affairs. Yeah. See, I think it's great to combine your swearing in speech with your 'I cheated on my wife' speech. That way, the wife only has to stand beside you one time. You get it all out of the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, his wife admitted to having an affair too. Did you see that? Finally, a wife of a politician who doesn't just stand there when her husband cheats. She goes out and does it too. Yeah! There you go! That is democracy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the last governor was going to hookers. The new governor admits to having an affair. Do you think New Yorkers are longing with the good old days when Rudy Giuliani would just run around in women's clothes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Barack Obama addressed some of the more controversial comments made by his longtime minister, Jeremiah Wright. The guy said some crazy stuff, like, 'gays caused 9/11, Hurricane Katrina was God's revenge for our sins.' Oh, I'm sorry. That's Pat Robertson. That's the other side's nutball minister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Barack Obama admitted he wasn't aware of some of the more radical rhetoric because, like most Americans, he falls asleep in church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Elton John announced, this week, he's going to sing at a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton next month. Is that a good idea? Hillary and Elton on the stage? Let's hope they don't show up wearing the same pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney went to Iraq, or as he calls it, spring break. Yeah! See the oil buddies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Cheney on the news, sitting with the troops having breakfast? Did you see the breakfast in front of him? The plate was loaded with sausage, bacon, eggs. Who put that meal together? Al Qaeda? Was that their plan? Wait for his heart to explode when he's in Iraq?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of that, this week marks the fifth anniversary of the Iraq war,&quot; and do you remember when critics were &quot;saying, 'Oh, the war was just about oil so we could keep the price of gasoline cheap'? Oh, that worked out well, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we're the ones with shock and awe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some hope, though. According to the 'San Gabriel Tribune,' because of the high price of crude, drilling for oil in LA is profitable. Once again, Los Angeles could see oil wells popping up all over the place. A lot of people say the oil wells would be an eyesore. But, they say not to worry&quot; because &quot;they're going to disguise them as cell phone towers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, they say Los Angeles could become a major oil-producing region, just like the Middle East. Only, of course, more violent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Department of Homeland Security deported 280,000 illegal immigrants last year. And listen to this. They're getting tough. They're threatening to deport them again this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I've been watching that John Adams miniseries on HBO. ... Boy, it's really good. You know, it's fun to see all the Founding Fathers. They're all in it. John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Monday, right after being sworn in, the new governor...of New York, David Paterson, he announces that he cheated on his wife. I'm thinking, this guy didn't waste any time, did he?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And...not a minute too soon, there's a quiz that you can take to tell if your spouse is cheating. Question number one. Is your spouse a governor?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's gotten crazy. The only politician in New York City that's not having extramarital sex is Ulysses S. Grant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney. You know where he is right now? He's in Baghdad. He visited there. While he was in Iraq, he said it's a 'successful endeavor.' At least I think that's what he said. It was hard to hear over the explosions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the economy? ... George Bush earlier today reassured the country about the economy.&quot; He &quot;said, 'I'm on top of it,'&quot; and &quot;I said to myself, 'Well, that's good enough for me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was one bit of good news for the economy earlier today. At the last minute, a large investment bank was rescued&quot; when it &quot;was adopted by Angelina Jolie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, David Paterson was sworn in as the new governor of New York. And hours later, he admitted to having an extramarital affair. ... Yeah, so in other words, he's already fitting right in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's daughter says that a lot of guys don't want to date her because her dad makes her too high-profile. Yeah. That's part of the reason. It's also because McCain's daughter is 63 years old.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new CNN poll just out today, John McCain would win the presidential election if only beer drinkers voted. Now, a Democrat, either Hillary or Barack would win if only wine drinkers voted. But here's the interesting part, if we all got really drunk on tequila, Ralph Nader might actually have a shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican presidential nominee John McCain is in Iraq this week. He said his goal as president is to introduce to the Iraqi people the concept of the early bird special. Yeah, eating dinner at 4:30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney also in Iraq this week. Cheney told the Iraqi government that their leaders have to show some progress on both their domestic and economic fronts. And the Iraqis said to Cheney, 'You first.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today marks the five-year anniversary of the war in Iraq, and President Bush said his decision to invade was 'remarkably effective.' Yeah, yeah, that's why we're still there after five years. Yeah, happy anniversary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush also went on to say that Bear Stearns is just going through a tough time and victory's just around the corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interesting fact came out today on the new $5 dill. Turns out it used to be the old $10 bill. I didn't know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Barack Obama criticized John McCain for mistakenly saying that Iran was sending aid to al Qaeda in Iraq, which is not true. And afterwards, President Bush told McCain, 'Don't worry about it. I didn't know that either.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, yesterday, Barack Obama gave a big speech on race, and there was one heckler in the audience&quot; who &quot;kept screaming crazy stuff the whole time. Turns out it was his pastor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could now be profitable for oil companies to start drilling for oil in Los Angeles again. And once again, I think President Bush doesn't really understand this issue. Like today, he announced the drawing of a contingency plan to invade the San Fernando Valley.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain recently said he supports George Bush's Iraq policy. I said, 'Well, sure, slice me eight more years of that, will you? Let's go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do like John McCain. He looks like a guy who thinks he is sheriff of the neighborhood, you know? 'You're going to have to trim back those hedges.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has released another tape. The title of his latest message is 'the response will be what you see, not what you hear.' Oh, what, is bin Laden the Riddler now?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in the latest statement, bin Laden threatens the newspaper cartoonist who drew that disrespectful cartoon of Muhammad. ... But, surprisingly -- I was surprised. He likes 'Marmaduke.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spoke about the war in Iraq again today. This week marks the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the war. Bush said, 'turning back now would harm all the gains we've made.' Like oil $100 a barrel worthless dollar, a recession. We can't afford to lose any of that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mentioned earlier this week, in Hawaii, the price of gas, over $4 a gallon. Man. Once again, I think President Bush is a little confused. When he heard about this he said, 'You know, I'm more concerned about the price of gasoline here in America.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Democratic congressman from Michigan, John Dingell, wants to add an additional 50-cent tax on every gallon of gas. How many think that will reduce the demand for gas? How many think it would reduce our demand for morons in Congress?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, John McCain was in England, where he visited his birthplace, Stonehenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest polls out today, John McCain now in a double digit lead over the Democrats. ... To give you an idea how far McCain is ahead in the polls, today, Hillary offered him the vice presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we have former presidential candidate John Edwards on the show tonight. ... He ran a terrific campaign. His number one issue, of course, was the poor and those who live in poverty. Or, as we call them now, Bear Sterns stockholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the economy has hurt Edwards too. In fact, today, he to get his haircut at Fantastic Sam's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, anybody see the new $5 bill&quot; that &quot;just came out?&quot; The Treasury &quot;has taken steps to discourage counterfeiters, such as making it worth less than a dollar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the new governor&quot; of New York, &quot;David Paterson, is speaking out. Remember, he announced he had a bunch of affairs? Well, now he says he's no longer seeing other women. But it's a trick. He's blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that high-priced call girl,&quot; Ashley Dupre, &quot;the one that was having sex with Governor Spitzer, has reportedly lost a $1 million offer to pose nude because old nude photos have popped up on the Internet. So let that be a lesson to all you young women out there. Don't ever think of posing nude until after you're a successful hooker.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, this week the swallows returned to San Juan Capistrano. ... Unfortunately, the mission they always return to had a...subprime mortgage foreclosed on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunday, of course, is Easter,&quot; and a &quot;big problem for Barack Obama&quot; is going to be &quot;where's he going to go to church?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Easter, of course, is the time we celebrate miracles. See, we don't have miracles like...the resurrection and the parting of the Red Sea anymore. You know what I'm saying? Like, today, our idea of a miracle is gas under $3.50 a gallon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, boy, there is nothing but disasters in the news. It's unbelievable. Floods in the Midwest, fires in Texas, the Democratic Party ? it's just unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad the Democrats are doing, in a stunning reversal, John McCain now 10% ahead of Hillary Clinton and 7% ahead of Barack Obama. And this is after Iraq, a recession, and no healthcare. Imagine how far ahead he'd be if the Republicans had actually done something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, John McCain received a warm welcome in Israel. ... You know, he is hugely popular in Israel ever since he stood with the Jewish people against the Pharaoh. They've never forgotten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating has reached a record low -- 31%. Wow. His popularity is so low now, on his Facebook page, he only has imaginary friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden has released another anti-American speech. And out of force of habit, Barack Obama has denounced the remarks and said he wasn't even in the room at the time the things were being made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, critics are poring over Osama bin Laden's latest audio tape. Simon called it pretentious. Paula said it was not his best work. And Randy said, 'Dawg, it's just not working for me.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this....latest audio tape, Osama bin Laden blasts the cartoon showing the prophet Mohammad in a turban. See, this is why President Bush and Osama bin Laden are such enemies. Bush loves cartoons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 'Time' magazine is reporting that the Vatican is in negotiations to open its first Catholic church in Saudi Arabia. It'll be called Our Lady of Perpetual Terror.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the rabbi who's selling the building said, 'I hope you have better luck than we did.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today at the White House, President Bush hosted the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Young kids roll Easter eggs with spoons across the White House lawn.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In more serious news, big controversy last week after State Department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates,&quot; and it turns out &quot;they got a hold of John McCain's Social Security number. ..

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the revenue raised by this tax goes towards repairing all the damage caused by tax payers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. Iran, Iran now trying to increase tourism from America. They want Americans go to Iran as tourists. Yeah, you know what you call that? Hostage. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, Hillary Clinton's campaign is now saying she misspoke&quot; when &quot;she said last week that she landed under sniper fire during a trip to Bosnia as First Lady. Turns out, it was gunfire on a trip to LA. See, she got confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Democratic front-runner Barack Obama&quot; will &quot;appear on 'The View' this Friday.&quot; He &quot;thought his pastor was loud and opinionated,&quot; wait &quot;till Joy gets hold of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has been charged with perjury and lying under oath after being caught sending sexually explicit text messages to his female chief of staff.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to CNN,&quot; only &quot;1% of the 28,000 commercial flights in the country have an on-board armed air marshall.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And over the weekend, a pilot's gun accidentally went off in the cockpit of a US Airways flight from Denver to Charlotte.&quot; And &quot;Hillary Clinton said today the bullet&quot; just &quot;missed her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, Mexico now the second fattest nation on the Earth, right behind us, the United States. In fact, if you go to the border, you can actually see them getting stuck in that hole in the fence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this Hillary Clinton? Apparently now they caught her exaggerating about a trip to Bosnia a few years ago. Do you hear about this?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has announced that during President Bush's last year in office, he's going to visit more countries than in any other year of his Presidency.&quot; Bush &quot;says he's going to accomplish all of this in one weekend by going to Epcot Center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton &quot;has been caught telling a lie&quot; about a trip she took to Bosnia, and &quot;the whistle blower&quot; was Sinbad, the comedian. Nothing &quot;says great journalism like the co-star of 'Jingle All The Way.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But wouldn't it be funny if Hillary Clinton's campaign is derailed by a comedian. It has happened before. When John McCain first ran for the Senate, he was called a liar by the most famous comedian of the time, Mark Twain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama called Hillary today to thank her for distracting everyone from his crazy pastor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ever watch the History Channel?&quot; Last night, &quot;I saw the most exciting program I've seen in years. 'Hillary Clinton's War Stories.' Have you seen this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think last night's episode was 'Hillary's First Blood.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary Clinton coming under fire for claiming she was under fire while in Bosnia. Luckily, she was wearing her Kevlar pantsuit at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Hillary now says that she just made an honest mistake when she said she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia. ... Do you think this is a big deal? See, all candidates exaggerate. Remember when McCain ran in 2000,&quot; and &quot;he had to retract a claim that he had been under cannon fire from the Confederates?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, this has hurt Hillary's claim that she's the candidate with the most experience. Like, when Hillary said she went to 80 countries, turns out she only wanted to go to 1 country, but she had booked it through Priceline.com.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary and Barack are really going at it. They're insulting each other, trading barbs, attacking each other's credibility. In fact, the only break they take from attacking each other is when they promise the American people, if elected, they can unite the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, McCain is moving up in the polls. In fact, he appears to be getting support from younger voters. How young, you say? Well, yesterday, he was endorsed by Nancy Reagan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's right. Yesterday, former First Lady Nancy Reagan officially came out for John McCain. She said she's either going to endorse McCain or nobody. Well, that's got to make you feel good, huh? That you beat out nobody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at a speech earlier today in Sterling, Virginia, President Bush said the economy is going through a rough patch, but he's confident things will work out. Unless you own a home, own a car, have stock, or you're over 65.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is now outsourcing our passports overseas. Foreign companies are making our passports. See, this is smart thinking. Now, when we deport illegals, they can go home, make their own passports, and come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iran is now trying to attract American tourists,&quot; but &quot;they need a new slogan. That 'Death to America' thing&quot; is &quot;just not bringing them in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study, Mexico, now the second fattest nation on Earth, right behind the United States. Yeah. That's because the only people left in Mexico are the ones too fat to actually run across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a study by the American Automobile Association, text messaging can be hazardous,&quot; especially &quot;if you're the Mayor of Detroit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know this story? The mayor of Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick, has been charged with perjury after he got caught sending his chief of staff text messages about having sex. Yeah. He's also being investigated for having strippers at the mayor's mansion. Yeah. And of course, people are shocked. Detroit has a mayor's mansion?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, yeah. They're calling this the worst thing to come out of Detroit since the Ford Pinto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you, every day, more revelations coming out about the new governor in New York, David Paterson. Remember last week, he admitted he had a couple of extra-marital affairs? Monday, he admitted that he had done cocaine and marijuana, and today he came forward to admit that, three summers ago, he killed a couple of drifters up in the Poconos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Fred Thompson announced he's getting back into acting. ... That's a pretty gutsy decision, considering his less than convincing portrayal of a presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, a group called the New England Historic Genealogical Society is now claiming that Hillary Clinton is related to Angelina Jolie. ... Well, they also claimed John McCain is related to that 10 million-year-old bee stuck in amber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some kids in Oregon found a parachute in the middle of the a field&quot; that could belong to &quot;legendary outlaw&quot; DB Cooper. In &quot;the 1970's, he parachuted out of a plane with $200,000 in stolen cash&quot; and &quot;was never seen again. ... The FBI thinks he could be hiding out in some remote place. Where would you go? CBS in the middle of the night?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of parachuting, the &quot;first President Bush celebrated his 80th birthday by going skydiving. John McCain did something similar for his 80th birthday. He jumped off a pterodactyl.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama back from his vacation in the Virgin Islands. He played a lot of shuffle board down there. See, he's pretty smart. He was doing that in case John McCain challenges him to a duel.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And MSNBC is reporting there's a chance that John McCain will pick Condoleezza Rice as his vice president. Well, actually, I think that's a perfectly balanced ticket, right? I mean, he's white, she's black. He's a man, she's a woman. He's always steamed, she's Rice. See what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you heard Hillary Clinton's new campaign slogan? 'Incoming!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is now outsourcing the...manufacturing of our passports overseas. ... See, this is how a global economy works. See, when an illegal immigrant from Mexico living in LA and working in a Japanese-owned company wants to go home to visit his relatives, he uses a passport made in Thailand that he gets by calling a customer service number in India. You see how it works? This could be the thing that makes Lou Dobbs' head explode.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Iran is trying to attract American tourists. Well that should be easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know I mentioned this last night. Iran has not been successful with&quot; its 'Death To America' slogan. Yeah, that's not bringing the tourists in,&quot; but &quot;I don't think the new one is much better: 'Whoever Goes To Iran, Stays In Iran.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, some good gossip. It seems Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has fired Clint Eastwood from his job on the California State Parks Commission. ... Man, they had some disagreement. How would you like to be in the room for that one? 'So you feel so lucky now, punk?' 'Get out! You are terminated!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arizona's Senator John McCain has pulled ahead of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. If elected, you know, he will be 105 years old when he takes office, which would make him the oldest president ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know we have a lot of college students here. Now, here's kind of a philosophical question. Now, if a sniper fires a gun in the woods and nobody is around, does Hillary Clinton still hear it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary Clinton now blaming her embellishment of her Bosnia trip on lack of sleep,&quot; but it &quot;looks like...there's been a little more fudging of Hillary's records. Remember when she said she was deeply involved in the Irish peace process? ... Yeah, turns out she just saw 'Lord of the Dance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, they had a reformed al Qaeda guy on the news last night. This guy is no longer a terrorist. And this is interesting. He said the main reason that most young men become terrorists is to get out of an arranged marriage. Yeah, the second biggest reason they become terrorists -- to get out of a regular marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we had a big scare here this week at LA Airport. Qantas flight loaded with Americans had four tires go flat during takeoff. ... Do we need any more proof that we're getting fat in this country? Huh? I mean, we're blowing out airplane tires just sitting on the tarmac. Can we stop eating, please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of trendy people now&quot; are &quot;pledging to simplify their lives&quot; by buying &quot;nothing but the basics, like food, medicine and toiletries. You know, people have been doing this for years. It's called living on Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big movie opening this weekend is 'Run, Fat Boy, Run.' Isn't this what the Democrats are trying to get Al Gore to do now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama...was on 'The View' this morning. I guess they're still trying to find somebody to fill that Rosie spot so they went to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the ladies of 'The View' were absolutely giddy to have him there. You know, he's related to Brad Pitt, so you can understand why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't seen Barbara Walters so smitten within a candidate since...a young Warren G. Harding hit the scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton was in Indiana trying to get more people there to like her. She claims to have taken some incoming sniper fire at the Indianapolis Airport baggage carousel, but other than that, they say the trip went very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know that Clinton and Obama will ever be friendly enough now to be running mates, but John McCain is rumored to be close to asking his former rival, Mitt Romney, to be his running mate. ... John McCain and Mitt Romney, to me, look like two guys who model overcoats in Sears catalogs, right?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big movie at the box office this week, '21.' It was all about Barack Obama's bowling score.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that in the news? ... Oh, this is great. You know, when you campaign, you've got to do all this stuff. Well, they showed Barack Obama bowling, and this is true,&quot; his &quot;score was...37. Out of a possible 300, he bowled 37. Of course, being a Democrat, he automatically demanded a recount, so they had to go back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, see, I tell you -- you know what's interesting? He's not a bowler, obviously. And Barack Obama made the typical mistake a lot of rookie bowlers make. He bowled sober. See, you never do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To show how competitive it's getting, I guess, Hillary showed up later, bowled a 38.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in a stunning announcement, Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey Jr., who had said he would remain neutral,&quot; has &quot;endorsed Barack Obama. He said he did it because his four young daughters told him they wanted Barack for president, which also explains his choice for vice president, Hannah Montana.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain having trouble raising money. You know, a lot of people think he's raising money the old guy way. You know, with the metal detector at the beach. Yeah, I think that's the big problem, that's probably what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York Governor David Paterson, who, in his first two weeks in office has admitted to having a number of extramarital affairs and doing drugs, he now says he'll no longer talk about his personal life. Phew! Thank God he made at decision before he said anything embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush threw out the first pitch to open the Washington Nationals' new baseball park. It was high and to the right, just like to his tax cuts for the rich people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you hear about this? The Pentagon ordered a full inventory of our nuclear arsenal to see what's missing. ... Wait, now we can't even find our own weapons mass destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, happy birthday to Al Gore,&quot; who is &quot;60 years old today. ... A lot of mixed feelings for Al on this milestone. On one hand, he loves cake. But those 60 candles -- global warming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday down in Washington DC, President Bush threw out the first pitch at the Nationals game. ... He...left in the seventh inning and I thought, 'Well, great, at least he has an exit strategy for that!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I get a kick out of John McCain. He looks like the guy who can't remember if he took his pill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who goes to bed after Andy Rooney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who has his exhaust pipe tied to his rear bumper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the presidential race. You know, Hillary now is behind in states, behind in delegates,&quot; behind &quot;in the popular vote, and also...behind in the polls. And today, she said to Obama, 'Are you ready to throw in the towel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they make a big deal out of everything. She was talking about visiting Bosnia years ago, and they had to crawl to the airport under sniper fire. And then they dig out the footage and everything was 'Hey, how ya doin'? Nice ta see ya.' Well, she says the reason she said that was because of sleep deprivation. ... So I'm thinking, well, she'll be great on those 3 a.m. phone calls, won't she?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself, this campaigning for president is rugged stuff. And they're saying now that Hillary's campaign is having money troubles. ... As a matter of fact, it's ugly. Earlier today, a repo guy...confiscated her pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton finally admitted to exaggerating about being under sniper fire in Bosnia,&quot; but she is &quot;still at it. She's been telling people she's in the Final Four.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. In response to the country's severe economic crisis, President Bush has been working around the clock. He has drafted landmark legislation that will end the recession within a month and bring down the price of gas by 35%. April Fool's!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the rich are still going to be getting richer. Don't worry about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;April Fool's, of course,&quot; the &quot;day when people try to fool their friends and relatives, as opposed to April 15th, where you try to fool the IRS. Totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary Clinton was in Philadelphia today, where she told the crowd she is like the movie character, Rocky. ... Now, if I remember the movie correctly, doesn't Rocky get the crap beat out of him and lose?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton is &quot;just like Rocky, except when she's in Bosnia, then she's like Rambo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary still taking a lot of heat over claims she had to duck and run for cover at the airport in Bosnia. Now it turns out, Barack Obama also had to duck and run for cover at the airport. Not in Bosnia, at O'Hare. On his way back from vacation, he thought he saw his pastor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Barack Obama bowling in Pennsylvania the other day? Bowled a 37 out of 300. No, but see, that's good,&quot; because &quot;I want a president that's bad at bowling. I mean, shouldn't he have more important things to do? Look, I don't know President Bush, but I'm willing to guess he's a great bowler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And two Ohio companies who stage events for Hillary say that they've been trying to get paid. For weeks, they've been trying to get the Clinton campaign to pay their bill. But the Clintons won't answer their e-mails or return their phone calls. And ironically, they even tried calling Hillary at 3:00 a.m. and nobody answered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on a lighter note, Hillary Clinton announced that her favorite music group is the Rolling Stones. And she said they were the first concert she ever went to. John McCain said the first concert he ever attended was two guys pounding on a log with sticks to celebrate a successful woolly mammoth hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy birthday to Al Gore,&quot; who is &quot;60 years old,&quot; but he &quot;just couldn't enjoy the party. He was so obsessed with how quickly the ice cream was melting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the CEOs of the five mafia,&quot; sorry, &quot;five oil companies testified before Congress today.&quot; They &quot;said their profits are not excessive. They pointed out&quot; that &quot;they have a lot of expenses, like paying off congressmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush threw out the first ball the other night at the Washington National's home opener. Boy, wasn't it nice&quot; to see &quot;Bush throwing out something besides the Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on 'Meet the Press' the other day, the head of the CIA, Michael Hayden, said, torture is just a legal term. Yeah, unless you're the one being tortured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Olympic torch has made its way to China,&quot; where they are going to &quot;have some new events this year. ... I understand they're going to let children compete to see who can make the fastest pair of Nikes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear Hillary Clinton's campaign is out of money. As a matter of fact, it may be true. Earlier today, she was shopping at 'Pantsuits For Less.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who I like is that John McCain. Do you folks like John McCain? He looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who...can't stop talking about how well his tomatoes are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who goes into town for turpentine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy that's always got wiry hair growing out of new places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who points out the spots they missed at the car wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Letterman? You think that stuff's pretty funny, don't you? Well, you look like a guy whose laptop would be seized by the authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look like a guy caught smuggling reptiles in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look like the night manager of a creepy motel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you look like the guy who enjoys getting into a hot tub, and watching his swim trunks inflate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The Washington Post' reports that John McCain is having trouble raising enough money for his campaign. Yeah. Plus, every time someone does donate money to McCain, he puts it in a card and sends it to his grandchildren.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Hillary Clinton told a crowd in Pennsylvania that she can still win the Democratic nomination. Yep, that's right, it's April Fool's Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Barack Obama went bowling in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and he bowled a 37. I bowled 37 when I was a baby, and I was drunk by the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while campaigning in Pennsylvania yesterday, Barack Obama told an 8-year-old boy that if he wants to be president, he should work hard in school, get good grades and find a job that helps people. To which President Bush said, 'That's an April Fool's Joke.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The London Daily Telegraph says that more and more Democrats now believe their candidate for president should be Al Gore, not Hillary or Barack. And today, President Bush said, 'Well, if Al Gore can run again, that means I can too, right?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest issue of 'Newsweek,' they're reporting that in Iraq, Shiites are turning on their own supporters. They're attacking their own people. Do you know what that means? The Shiites are really hitting the fans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The husband of Democratic US Senator Deborah Stabenow from Michigan has admitted he paid a prostitute he met on the Internet $150 for sex at a hotel room. Now, he could end up serving four years as governor of New York...if he is convicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke,&quot; while speaking &quot;before Congress, warned we may be headed towards a recession. Oh, thank you, Captain Obvious! Let me guess. Real estate market not looking too good either?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and Bush's secretary of housing announced he is stepping down. Well, sure. Nobody's got a house anymore. He's got nothing to do, might as well step down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, here is good news, ladies and gentlemen, the circus is in town at Madison Square Garden,&quot; and earlier &quot;today, Hillary Clinton claimed that once she was shot out of a cannon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is getting knocked around pretty good here lately. Every time she says something, people are jumping all over her. She compared herself to Rocky Balboa,&quot; and &quot;I'm thinking if she's Rocky, John McCain is the old cut man in the corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. He reminds me of a guy who spends a lot of time in the yard with a hose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;is looking for a vice presidential running mate,&quot; and he &quot;needs a guy who is conservative, understands the economy, and knows how to operate a defibrillator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, on the campaign trail, John McCain gave a speech at the high school he attended in Virginia. ... Yeah, and McCain told the senior class, 'What a coincidence. You graduated in '08 and I graduated in '08.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not such a great day here at CBS. The news department is laying off dozens of people. Apparently, they need to make room for Andy Rooney's eyebrows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you're aware of this, but our economy is struggling right now.

He says we may be headed towards a recession this year and the only way we can avoid it is to put a trillion dollars on North Carolina to win the NCAA Tournament.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very excited. We have the Italian Stallion on the show tonight. Hillary Clinton, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, in Philadelphia the other day, Senator Clinton said she's a lot like rocky balboa from the movie 'Rocky.' Is that a good idea? Don't we already have a president like Rocky? I mean, isn't eight years of a guy who talks like he's been hit in the head too many times enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know Hillary Clinton is in the new Martin Scorsese documentary on the Rolling Stones? Turns out she's a huge Rolling Stones fan. See, I think that's great. I mean, any time a politician can take time out from their busy day to help the elderly, I mean, that is so nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know she is working to get them all Rascal scooters? Did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And although some people call for her to pull out of the race, Hillary says she will not pull out because she wants everyone's vote to count. Unless you're voting for Obama. Then you can ignore that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of that, today, Barack Obama announced the first thing he would do as president, shut down all the bowling alleys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain said he is putting together a list of possible vice presidential candidates. In fact, yesterday, McCain said he had 20 names on his vice presidential list. And today, he had to cut it back to 18 when he found out Calvin Coolidge and Woodrow Wilson are already dead.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, we're learning more and more about John and Cindy McCain. He's on this big biography tour so you can learn about him. I guess his wife, Cindy, is worth over $100 million&quot; because &quot;the family made money selling Budweiser beer. Budweiser beer distributor, $100 million. So, he has a wife 20 years younger than him, free beer,&quot; and &quot;unlimited money. I think I speak for all guys when I go -- why is he running for president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Homeland Security Chief or Secretary&quot; Michael Chertoff &quot;announced that his department...will bypass all the environmental laws to build hundreds of miles of border fence between the United States and Mexico. Of course, this is a White House dream come true. Keeping Lou Dobbs happy while still being able to destroy the environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, how embarrassing this is this? The husband of US Senator Debbie Stabenow has admitted that he was stopped by the police after he paid a prostitute $150 for sex at a motel room. He got caught when he was pulled over by police for driving with a suspended license. And the policeman said, 'Do you know why we stopped you?' He said, 'Because I was with a prostitute in a motel room?' And the cop said, 'Uh, no!' An idiot! What an idiot!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soliciting a prostitute for $150. You thought his wife was mad. You should have seen Eliot Spitzer. He paid four grand. 'What am I doing? I've got to move to Michigan!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night, Barbara Walters had a special called 'Live to be 150.' And she showed people who are over 100 years old, leading active lives: jogging, hiking; one guy even running for president in the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary...lately has been comparing herself to Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa. Yup, she calls herself Rocky. And today she was wearing an Everlast pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you familiar with the Hillary Clinton 3:00 a.m. Phone call commercial that she has been running during her campaign. The idea is&quot; if &quot;the phone rings at 3:00 a.m.,&quot; who &quot;would you want to be president. She has another one. The phone rings&quot; at 3 a.m., &quot;Hillary...picks&quot; up the phone &quot;and says, 'Stop bothering me, President Obama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain...has one of those 3:00 a.m. campaign commercials. In this one, it is 3 a.m. and he just gets up to go to the bathroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. He looks like a guy who spends a lot of time on the lawn with the hose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has been campaigning all over the country this week. Yesterday, McCain gave a speech in Florida&quot; at &quot;2:30 in the afternoon because&quot; he &quot;was the after-dinner speaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new survey out today. The men of Iceland have the longest lifespan of any men in world. The average Icelandic man lives to be 79 years old. Or as John McCain calls them, 'whippersnappers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is making the most of the time he has left. Right now he's in Europe, which he calls Canada.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain said today he has a list of about 20 names of potential vice presidential candidates. I won't say McCain is old, but the list begins with 'Hear ye, hear ye.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was announced today that....John McCain has not been using Secret Service protection. ... See, apparently he has Life Alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Barack Obama said, as president, when it comes to solving the problem of global warming, he wants to have Al Gore at the table. ... Have you seen Al Gore lately? I think Al needs to push a little away from the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, good news for Hillary Clinton. You know Hillary's ad where she says she's ready to answer the phone at 3:00 a.m.? This is interesting. Today, she got a call from India, and they said if this presidential thing doesn't work out, they have a job for her in tech support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says that a recession is possible. It's possible, like that's a good thing. 'Oh, that's what we're striving for. Come on. If we all work together, we can do it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new study by the CDC, Chlamydia is up 19% since 2002. And once again, I don't think President Bush really understands this problem. Like, when he heard Chlamydia was up 19%, he said, 'That sounds like a good investment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, of course, is narrowing the gap&quot; in &quot;Pennsylvania and his campaign is pulling out all the stops for doing anything they can to get all the voters.&quot; For example, Obama's campaign &quot;is now giving away tickets to Dave Matthews concerts. Yeah, yeah. Apparently, this is Obama's attempt to win over really white voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in Europe right now. Today, he met with Romanian Prime Minister Popescu-Tariceanu. Yeah. Or as Bush calls him, 'Pop Tart.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain says he has 20 names on a list of possible vice presidential candidates. Yeah. Unfortunately, most of the names on the list are characters on 'Matlock.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a very rare letter found from Abraham Lincoln. It was put on auction this week. It's dated 1864. It is beautifully written. It starts out, 'Dear John McCain, the Union is in trouble.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Barack Obama announced his campaign raised $40 million in March! I know! Also this week, he got the endorsement of Jane Fonda. Hey, you win some, you lose some.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the Secret Service revealed yesterday that&quot; John McCain &quot;does not receive protection from them because his campaign hasn't requested any.&quot; McCain &quot;does have several vultures that follow him around, but other than that, nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you hear about this? Hillary Clinton's senior campaign advisor, a guy named Mark Penn, has left the campaign. Apparently, he was coming under some heavy sniper fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, as her campaign strategist, Mark Penn is widely credited with catapulting Hillary from a virtual shoo-in to second place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Penn was kicked off her campaign for promising Colombian officials that he would help them get a trade agreement that Hillary opposes. Did you hear his excuse? Hillary wasn't buying it. He said he misspoke. Yeah. He was sleep deprived. Yeah, that's it, sleep deprived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate John Edwards announced he will not...accept the nomination for vice president. Which is really important, considering no one has asked him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, John McCain visited his old high school. You know, in high school, he studied Latin. Did you know that? Well, he had to. That was the only language spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is...now crisscrossing the United States campaigning. Or as they're calling it, 'Antique Roadshow.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, he's an honest guy. McCain said last week he doesn't understand the economy as well as he should. In fact, did you hear his plan to save energy? 'Clap on, clap off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more bad news on the economic front; 80,000 people lost jobs last month. ... But to be fair, most of those are politicians caught with hookers, so I don't know if that actually counts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, true story, Hillary Clinton's top adviser abruptly left her campaign, yeah. ... Yeah, when he heard about it, Bill Clinton said, 'Wait, we can leave?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Saturday, Barack Obama held several campaign rallies in Montana. ... Officials say...Barack's visit attracted large crowds and doubled the black population of Montana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is the only...presidential candidate who is not currently using Secret Service protection. Yeah. Yeah. So far, McCain's only protection is the life insurance he bought from Wilford Brimley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new poll that just came out, it's hard to believe, 81% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. ... Yeah, the other 19% own gas stations.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see what's going on with the Olympic torch? A lot of protests. It arrived in San Francisco today on its way to China. The Chinese that were traveling with the torch were stunned by the number of protesters. They have never seen this many protesters alive, you know, so that's unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, Hillary Clinton said she has nothing against rich people. Of course not. She is one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it turns out Hillary and Bill earned $109 million over the past eight years. And Hillary said, to her surprise, her husband made a lot of money giving speeches. He made over $50 million speaking. So apparently, the only one not buying what Bill was saying is Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Hillary Clinton's campaign strategist, a man named Mark Penn, he had to step down this week. Apparently, he couldn't come up with anymore good, fake stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, more problems for Hillary. For the second time in just a couple of days, Hillary dropped a phony story from her stump speech. I guess she was going around telling this healthcare story, and then a hospital today said it is not true. ... Turns out, Hillary did not discover penicillin and did not invent the polio vaccine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while Barack Obama was in North Dakota, he was greeted by what they are calling the largest crowd...ever to see a political candidate in North Dakota -- over 17 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I saw a political expert on TV today, and he said the Pennsylvania primary, that's the big one with Hillary and Barack, he said it will likely come down to which candidate wins the white male vote. Oh, that's a relief. Maybe white men can finally have a say in how this country is run for a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that male monkeys prefer to play with masculine toys like dump trucks, while female monkeys prefer to play with feminine toys like stuffed animals. However, none of the monkeys would play with any of the toys from China, because they're worried about lead paint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canada just announced it may boycott this year's Summer Olympics because of China's treatment of Tibet. ... Yeah, when asked about the boycott, Canada's prime minister said, 'I'm very angry at China. Plus, we suck at summer sports.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people talking about...John McCain's temper. ... It's been reported that John McCain once got so angry at his wife during a public appearance that he called her the worst name you can call your wife. Yeah, that's right. He called her Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Hillary, big day in Washington. General Petraeus, the top general in Iraq, testified on Capitol Hill today, and he was questioned by Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. That's right, Obama and Clinton both had the same question for Petraeus ? 'Are you by any chance a superdelegate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The producers of the Latin Grammy Awards announced that the show is moving to Houston. Yeah, yeah. The Latin Grammys plan to get to Houston by sneaking over the border from Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Latest rumor -- this is weird -- is that CBS may shut down most of its news department and outsource its news gathering to CNN. Yeah. Yeah, CBS executives said, 'We want to grab that hot, young Larry King audience.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats announced today their convention this summer will be the 'greenest ever.' But the Republicans are doing their part too. For the Republican convention, John McCain is going to switch to cloth diapers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says...our sagging economy is poised for a rebound, which does not bode well for the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you forgot, taxes are due next week. You know, we all hate paying taxes but the truth of the matter is without our tax money, many politicians would not be able to afford prostitutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the insiders, Condoleezza Rice has been actively lobbying to be John McCain's vice presidential candidate. That would be interesting, don't you think? Condoleezza Rice, John McCain. Kind of like Ebony and Ornery.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former presidential candidate John Edwards announced this week he will not accept the nomination for vice president,&quot; to &quot;which the cashier at Wendy's said, 'Do you want a Frosty with this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is slowly catching up to Hillary Clinton in the polls in Pennsylvania. Experts say that if he winds up beating her there, then it's all over. But...these experts&quot; do not &quot;know Hillary,&quot; who is &quot;like Glenn Close in 'Fatal Attraction.' When you least expect it, she jumps out of the bathtub.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a lot of Democrats are asking President Bush to boycott the opening ceremonies to the upcoming Summer Olympics. Well, good luck with that. Boycott it? With the flags, the parades, the balloons? That's Bush's favorite part. He's not going to miss that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Got a lot of protests with the Olympics torch coming through California. ... You know, I can't believe this state even allowed the torch in here. Not because of Tibet. I mean, the guy running through the state with a giant torch at the beginning of brush fire season. How smart is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the government said today gas prices could hit $4 a gallon in the very near future. ... So for those of you visiting California, welcome to Tomorrow Land.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four dollars a gallon. That would be great. It means it's going down for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon now has developed a handheld lie detector that's going to be distributed to troops. It's amazing. They can actually aim it at someone, and when the person is talking, they can tell if that person is lying. In fact, when the military showed this to Senator Clinton, she said, 'Get that damn thing away from me!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a nationwide survey just released today, high school seniors on the average answered correctly only 48% of the questions about personal finance and economics. ... But that's still 10% better than Bush's economic team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, all three...presidential candidates appeared on 'American Idol.' ... Yeah. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell looked at them and said, 'Wait, there's a black guy, a woman, and a cranky white guy. You stole our formula!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new TV commercial for Hillary Clinton says she has...'a spine of steel.' ... Yeah. When he heard this, John McCain said, 'Oh, yeah, well, I've got a titanium hip.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, all three presidential candidates, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain appeared on a special 'American Idol.' ... See, we missed an opportunity. We should have voted for them right then and there, like we do on 'American Idol.' We'd have a president by tomorrow and save ourselves six months of this stupid campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. Not to be outdone, Ralph Nader made a very special surprise appearance on 'The Biggest Loser.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know John McCain does not use the Secret Service for protection? Yeah, yeah. He hasn't been using them. He has his own team. In fact, you know what you call those six guys that surround John McCain all the time? Pallbearers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton now running ads in Pennsylvania that say she was raised on pinochle and the American dream. Pinochle? Well, that will help with the young voters, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Washington this week, the presidential candidates&quot; got &quot;to grill our top commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus. And Hillary demanded...demanded an orderly troop withdrawal. And believe me, if there's anyone who knows when it's time to get out, it is Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, at Madison Square Garden, Elton John held a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's campaign. He raised $2.5 million. At his concert, Elton John lashed out and he attacked the misogynist anti-women feelings many Americans have. And then he played his hit song, 'The Bitch Is Back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the number two man in Al Qaeda in Iraq, terrorist mastermind Abu al-Masri, is dead. ... He reportedly died of natural causes.&quot; That is &quot;when you know the war has been going on a long time, okay? When your enemies just start dying of natural causes! How long is this war?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the congressional newspaper 'Roll Call' reports that a growing number of Democrats are acknowledging that 90-year-old senator Robert Byrd may be too old to chair the appropriations committee. Really? ... They can overlook the fact he was in the Ku Klux Klan, but if you're in the AARP, sorry, sorry. What about the Klan? Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, there are a number of anti-American demonstrations today. Not in Iran, at American Airline terminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, on the news, they said the cancellations may get worse. Worse? How can they get worse? You're cancelled. Huh? What, are they going to take your luggage and then punch you in the face too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, in New York City, Elton John held a big fundraiser for Senator Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Big. Yeah. Things got off to an awkward start when Hillary and Elton showed up wearing the same pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Elton John benefit concert, was apparently...a huge success -- $2.5 million was raised for Hillary's campaign. Yeah. Elton sang all his biggest hits for Hillary, except for 'The Bitch Is Back.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, a lot of controversy right now about China. During a speech, President Bush urged Chinese leaders to talk to the Dalai Lama and called him a really fine man. Cool. Yeah. Bush said, 'I used to be reluctant to meet with him. Then I found out he was not a real llama.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain was on 'The View' this morning. He got along well with Barbara Walters. I watched it. They were reminiscing about the Civil War. 'John, do you wemember Wobert Wee?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A victory for the whole nation really. The ladies of the 'view' had a big guest today. The Republican nominee for president, John McCain, sat down to chat. One interesting thing McCain said was that unlike President Bush, who says he's going, if he's president, he would boycott the Olympic ceremonies this summer in China. Not because of China's human rights record,&quot; but &quot;because the ceremonies start at 8:00 and he goes to bed at 6:45.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More bad news for the Detroit Tigers,&quot; who &quot;lost again last night.&quot; The Tigers are &quot;now 1-8,&quot; or &quot;as Hillary Clinton calls that, first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that a fire burned down Hillary Clinton's campaign office in Terre Haute, Indiana. You know, I knew Hillary's campaign was facing financial trouble,&quot; but when &quot;you're burning the building down for the insurance money, that's not...a good sign.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary was very upset by the fire. Luckily, she says she was glad she was able to run into the burning building, save six children, then go back and rescue three puppies. So that worked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see Bill Clinton out there defending Hillary? Well, he's defending Hillary's story about her Bosnia trip. And he blamed the press for blowing it out of proportion. He said she made the comments at 11:00 p.m., exhausted after a day of campaigning. He should have left it there,&quot; but &quot;he went on to say that Hillary is 60 years old and when the people attacking her are 60, they'll forget some things too. Is that the best defense for somebody running for president? 'She's just old and forgetful, that's all. She's not a liar. She's just old and forgetful.' Thanks a lot, Bill! Women love that when you yell out how old they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, experts are now suggesting if Hillary loses Pennsylvania, she could be finished. I don't want to say Hillary's days might be numbered, but her Secret Service code name, Katie Couric. See, you guys have heard that rumor too...that Katie Couric might be replaced as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you believe how high gas is in Los Angeles? Man, it's unbelievable. Give you an idea of how expensive it is, today, I saw a van with 50 legal Americans packed inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. The FAA announced today that the number of midair collisions are down. Well, of course they're down. The planes are all on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, do you know why all these planes are being grounded? There's a wiring problem.&quot; The &quot;FAA said today under certain circumstances, the wiring in the wheel well could catch fire and cause an explosion. But they assured the public there was no issue of public safety. Really? No safety issue there? I show up with three ounces of shampoo in my luggage: 'Ho! Hold up, hold up! Let's go! Come on, come on!'&quot; But when there is &quot;a fire in the rear wheel well: 'Go ahead, get on!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be speaking at a convention of gay Republicans. ... Yeah, Arnold could get in trouble because he plans to start his&quot; speech &quot;by saying, 'Hello, girlie men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to his tax return last year, Vice President Cheney donated $166,000 to charity. ... Yeah, most of the money went to Cheney's favorite holiday charity, Coal for Tots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China is recalling thousands of pairs of novelty hillbilly teeth because the teeth may contain lead paint. ... Yeah, when he heard that China was recalling the hillbilly teeth, President Bush said, 'Okay, now I'm boycotting the Olympics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama got himself into a little hot water in Pennsylvania when he said small town people become bitter and cling to guns or religion because of economic problems. Well, sure, you pray your house doesn't get repossessed, and when they take it, you pull out your gun. Makes perfect sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton attacked Barack Obama, called him 'elitist,' and said he was out of touch with poor people. Later, Bill Clinton gave a speech on the subject and charged a million bucks for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, did you see this on the news? Hillary Clinton was shown at a bar in Indiana drinking a beer and doing a shot of whiskey. Hey, and it worked. Today, Ted Kennedy switched back. 'I'm for Hillary now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all see that? She took the shot with the beer chaser. Did it like an old pro. Give you an idea how much she drank, when the phone rang at 3:00 a.m., slept right through it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an effort to try and connect with some of the rural voters in Pennsylvania, Hillary said she has gone hunting, and once shot a duck. ... Don't confuse that with Barack. He shot himself in the foot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I like Cheney. He shot a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And General David Petraeus was grilled by the presidential candidates and other congressional leaders on Capitol Hill for two days last week.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, the State Department has officially disapproved of former president Jimmy Carter's trip to visit Syria, where he's meeting with the terrorist group Hamas. ... And I thought this was kind of petty. For his return trip, they switched his flight to American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope will be here tomorrow. ... You know who's picking him up at the airport? President Bush. This is true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, they held the Ozark UFO Conference. ... I understand Ralph Nader was there trying to pick up an endorsement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Temperature over 100 degrees here in Los Angeles over the weekend. ... In fact, it was so hot, the guy at the gas station near my house got sunstroke from going up to the sign so many times to change the price.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, but there's good news on the horizon. The government now estimating there could be up to 4.3 billion barrels of oil under the ground in North Dakota. And today, President Bush said, 'If that's true, we could be in North Dakota for another 100 years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Mexico City, thousands of protesters demonstrated against the government's plan to allow foreign oil companies to drill for oil in Mexico. The protesters marched in the streets of Mexico City, and they kept marching right past the city limits. They got up to the border here. I think they're in El Segundo now. They're still walking. Still marching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, in Mexico, the government owns the oil industry. Unlike here, where the oil industry owns the government. It's totally different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, in more serious news, according to a new study in the 'Archives of General Psychiatry,'&quot; they &quot;now say depressed people are more likely to develop Alzheimer's. Well, that should snap them right out of it, huh?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, President Bush actually met the Pope at the airport? ... And that wasn't easy because, you know, they don't let you stop at the curb anymore. So, Bush had to keep circling, the Pope runs out and Bush is driving by. The Pope is trying to get him. Oh, it was a huge, huge, big deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although I don't think President Bush is too familiar with the Catholic religion. There was one awkward moment when President Bush kept looking behind the Pope going, 'So where's Mrs. Pope?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also told the Pope that he has prayed every single day since he became president. Hey, since Bush became president, we've all prayed every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now what do you think of this idea? This seems odd to me. For the Pope's arrival ceremony at the White House tomorrow, they're going to give him a 21-gun salute. Now, really, what better welcome for the apostle of peace than a show of firearms? I mean, whose idea was that? Dick Cheney's?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope will be visiting New York later in the week. He'll be doing a mass at Yankee Stadium,&quot; then he will &quot;spend over 12 hours hearing the sins of the two New York governors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, we also want to wish Pope Benedict a happy birthday. Tomorrow, he'll be 81 years old. ... Do you realize in a couple more years, he could be the next Republican nominee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview on 'Charlie Rose,' Ted Turner of CNN...said that global warming will destroy the Earth, turn the survivors into cannibals, we will turn on each other, and destroy each other. Kind of like the Democrats are doing now in the primaries.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, I was at Starbucks today. I had the new Barack Obama roast. Have you had this? It tasted kind of bitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's such a huge story.&quot; Today, &quot;they asked President Bush what he thought about Hillary Clinton calling Barack Obama an elitist. And President Bush, very conciliatory, he said, 'Elitist, Methodist, Lutheran. As long as he's a Christian,'&quot; that is &quot;'the important thing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the footage of Hillary at that bar in Indiana? Whoa! Doing the whiskey? Doing those shots with the beer chaser? Boy, you thought she embellished the Bosnia story before. You should hear her tell it after a couple of whiskeys and a beer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, you know, she went a little too far. Did you see that when she took the beer can and smashed it on her head? You know, that doesn't seem presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, a lot of people at the bar thought that Hillary drank too much. They said she was getting tipsy, because she was...slurring her words. It turns out it was just a big wad of chewing tobacco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is happening to our Democratic candidates? Aren't they both Ivy League-trained lawyers? I mean, Hillary is drinking, Barack is bowling. Suddenly, we got Larry the Cable Guy running for president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And anyway, after Hillary Clinton said she went hunting, Barack Obama started ridiculing&quot; her &quot;recent embrace of the Second Amendment. ... He said, 'She's talking like Annie Oakley.'&quot; And &quot;today, John McCain chimed in. He said, 'Hey, I knew Annie Oakley. Annie Oakley was a friend of mine. Hillary is no Annie Oakley.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain said today one of the reasons we are in a recession is because of the very 'greedy' people on Wall Street. Then he thanked those people for their...campaign contributions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, gas prices hit another all-time high today. It's getting crazy. Well, fortunately, most Americans now don't need gas to commute to work, because half have lost their jobs&quot; and &quot;the other half have lost their homes. So, you see, it works out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is April 15th. This is tax day everywhere in the United States,&quot; and Hillary Clinton &quot;had a tough time doing her taxes this year. See, her accountant couldn't figure out whether to classify Bill as an asset or a liability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines are planning to merge. ... Their goal, of course, is to be able to cancel more flights than American Airlines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope is coming to New York City,&quot; but he &quot;arrived earlier today in Washington DC.&quot; But when he was getting on his &quot;flight in Rome, he was almost not allowed on the aircraft because he tried to bring on more than three ounces of holy water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain apologized today after it was revealed that some the 'McCain family recipes' posted on his website were actually plagiarized from the Food Network. I am amazed. How many different recipes can there be for prunes and creamed corn?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, can I just say, John McCain has a website? Whoo, get you grandpa!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a beautiful day today in Southern California,&quot; which is &quot;the good news.&quot; The &quot;bad news is we might not have many more of them left. They just released the study that says in the next 30 years there is a 97% chance that Southern California will have an earthquake magnitude 6.7 or larger, and there's a 40% chance of either being run over or attacked by Britney Spears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is April 15,&quot; and &quot;that means taxes were due today. ... I don't mind the taxes, but I don't like writing the check. I thought we were supposed to be passing the bill for irresponsible spending on to our grandchildren. What happened to them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, Pope Benedict arrived in the United States. ... More than 10,000 people are on the waiting list to get into the Pope's mass at Yankee Stadium on Sunday. That's Hannah Montana big. That's really good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two major airlines,&quot; Delta and Northwest, &quot;have announced they'll merge to form the world's largest airline.&quot; But &quot;I don't know about their new company name. They've merged to form DethWest, which to me has a negative connotation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the day after tax day, of course. See, this is the day that unites people, I think. It's a day when wealthy Americans with money from big cities are just as bitter as Americans in small towns who are broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Pope Benedict XVI arrived here in America yesterday.&quot; President Bush &quot;actually went out to the airport to meet him. Kind of embarrassing for the President. As each person got off the plane, he said, 'You the Pope? Pope?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House held a big dinner tonight honoring the Pope, but the Pope chose not to attend. ... I think President Bush was a little hurt. In fact, he said today, 'You know, after the trouble we went through to prepare a kosher meal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, when the Pope arrived at the White House, he was given a 21-gun salute. That's got to make Barack Obama a little uncomfortable. Guns and religion, you know, that kind of thing. Get a little bitter. I don't know about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one really embarrassing moment -- you see this on the news? When the Pope blessed the crowd with holy water, well, some of it splashed on Dick Cheney, burned his skin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what President Bush said to the Pope after his speech today? This is an exact quote. I'm not changing it. He said, 'Awesome speech, your Holiness.' ... See, he didn't want to say 'dude' because it was a formal affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest Gallup Poll, Barack Obama has the largest lead of the year so far over Hillary. He's up by 11%. Yeah. You thought Hillary was drinking before. Well, now she's really knocking 'em back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, Hillary Clinton continuing to attack Barack Obama. Hillary says Barack is an elitist who thinks he's smarter than most people. Is that a bad thing? Wouldn't it be nice for a change to have a president that's actually smarter than most people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, John McCain said he disagrees with President Bush on the issue of climate change. Now, believe me, McCain knows what he's talking about on this subject. Of all the presidential candidates, he is the only one who's actually lived through an ice age. ... So he's seen the changes so many people have only documented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I think President Bush is starting to change his opinion on global warming. Today, he announced an initiative to combat global warming. Again, I don't think he really understands the issue. He says his first act would be to order the Department of Energy to start drilling for solar power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a survey by the History Network, 98% of professional historians believe that George W. Bush's Presidency has been a failure. The other 2% believe it was a total disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some news from Iran. The chief of police in Tehran, who is in charge of fighting vice and bad morals, was found naked with six hookers. His name, Ahmed Spitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beautiful spring day here in New York City. ... It was so nice...that Barack Obama could not find anyone who was bitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, there was another debate&quot; between &quot;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.&quot; And &quot;Hillary...is getting a little desperate. So before the debate, she sneaks over to Barack Obama's podium...and buries a Michael Dukakis jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope is in the United States. Flew in to Washington, DC. Hillary Clinton declined to meet the Pope at the airport,&quot; because &quot;she was worried about sniper fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And coincidentally, today is the Pope's 81st birthday. ... President Bush greeted the Pope, and he knew it was his birthday, so he gave him a gift card to Big and Tall Hats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the White House, this was great. The Pope was greeted by a 21-gun salute, 22 if you count Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama today got the endorsement of Bruce Springsteen. ... Not to be outdone, John McCain got the endorsement from one of his musical contemporaries, Beethoven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bruce Springsteen announced on his website today he's endorsing Barack Obama for president, which means Obama now has Oprah and Bruce. And all he needs to complete the triumvirate is Judge Judy,&quot; and &quot;he has this whole thing sewn up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you, 'American Idol' creamed&quot; last night's debate between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and it is because of Simon Cowell. That is &quot;why it won. Because on that show, you know at least one person is telling the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched the debate between Hillary and Barack. It was interesting. She was kind of lashing out at him, but to be fair, I think it was just the liquor talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary Clinton trying to appeal to the blue collar voters. She's drinking, talking about hunting and fishing, and it's working. She is now, in the latest poll, up eight points in the mullet vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing how drinking is now part of this campaign. On 'Hardball' the other day, a student asked John McCain to do shots with him after the debate. And all of the candidates have their favorite drinks now. For example, John McCain, he prefers Old Grand Dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama, he likes the elitist Manhattan with extra bitters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, Hillary likes a shot of Old Crow, straight up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced his plan this week to limit greenhouse gases. He said he will ban all greenhouses. See, I don't think he understands exactly what's going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, of course, was Pope Benedict's birthday. ... They had a little party for him at the White House,&quot; and as &quot;you know, the Pope does not drink, he does not do drugs, and he's taken a vow of celibacy. So it's pretty safe to say no congressman showed up for that party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think President Bush got a little bit confused yesterday when he heard it was the Pope's birthday. You know, like, he said, 'His birthday? Where are we going to get a Christmas tree this time of year?' I don't think he understands...the Catholic religion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the party yesterday, Pope Benedict spoke out against evil, and then Dick Cheney gave the rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tax records show that...New York Governor David Paterson made $270,000 last year but only gave $150 to charity. Now, his predecessor, Governor Spitzer, he gave thousands of dollars to Charity. At least I think that was her name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Army said today it would begin destroying a huge stockpile of old chemical weapons found during a cleanup of a training range on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. To which President Bush said, 'That's where Saddam was hiding them. I knew! I knew they were someplace!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&quot; is &quot;working on a new book about his strategy for the war in Iraq. We have an advanced copy. ... It's called, 'Gee, It Looked So Easy On Paper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush met with the British prime minister today, Gordon Brown. He said, 'Doing a good job, Brownie. Heh-heh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Questions President Bush Asked The Pope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 'What are you doing for Passover?' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 'Could you record a wacky greeting for my voicemail?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 'Can I come up to visit you and Rudolph at the North Pole?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. 'Could you do something about my approval rating?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Washington it was so sunny the Pope was wearing his stained glass sunglasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These international trips are tricky,&quot; and &quot;often there can be some confusion and perhaps some embarrassment. They had an episode today in Washington, everybody is laughing about it now. But at the time it was not funny. The Pope, after the mass, accidentally gave the last rites to John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pope, God bless him, got on the Pope-Mobile&quot; after the mass. And then, &quot;President Bush followed him in the Dope-Mobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, Senators Obama and Clinton debated in Philadelphia,&quot; and the moderators, Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos, &quot;have been getting some criticism today...for rehashing the old issues.&quot; But Clinton and Obama have had a lot of debates, so all the issues are &quot;old. You know, what are you going to debate? Dentistry?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many people here from the Midwest? Well, you're lucky,&quot; because a &quot;5.2 earthquake hit Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Iowa this morning. ... The shaking was so bad, small-town people were really clinging to their religion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, here in California, we use a 5.2 to rock ourselves to sleep at night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night, I watched 'Big Brother' and 'Criminal Minds.' Not the TV shows, the debate between Barack and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you might have noticed that Hillary 'I Might Be A Redneck' Clinton,&quot; she has &quot;backed off that&quot; duck hunting thing. Remember &quot;how she said when she was a little girl, her dad taught her how to hunt and she shot a duck? Well, apparently, that story not sitting well with the anti-gun and pro-animal rights people in the Democratic Party. So, now she said, yes, it's true, she did shoot a duck, but it was only in self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with oil prices hitting an all-time high, Barack Obama promised today if he is elected, he will fund research to develop a car that runs on the bitterness of economically-strapped Pennsylvania voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is interesting. Congressman Jack Murtha said that John McCain is too old to be president, to which McCain said, 'Eh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new ABC poll says 58% of Americans don't think Hillary is honest or trustworthy. ... You know what you call a politician with numbers like that? President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ralph Nader, God bless him. Ralph Nader said today he has not taken $1 in campaign contributions. Oh, he wants to. He just can't get anybody to give him $1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited the White House this week. When President Bush heard his accent, he asked if he was related to Madonna. 'Wow, you guys talk alike.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, the Pope is in town. That's kind of exciting. Do you know this is the first papal visit to the White House in 29 years? Once again, I don't think President Bush is familiar with Catholic terminology. Like he said, 'What do you mean the first papal visit? We have people in and out of here all the time.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, listen to this. According to a new study just released this week, the Titanic probably sank because it was put together with faulty rivets. They're just discovering that now? Who did this study, FEMA?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Colorado Rockies beat the Padres 2-1&quot; in a &quot;22 inning game&quot; that &quot;lasted 6 hours and 16 minutes. ... Even Barack and Hillary were going, 'Would somebody win this thing, please?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton now says over the weekend that she's pro gun, likes guns, and loves to hunt ducks.&quot; Here is &quot;what Hillary...likes to do on weekend. She likes to squat in a duck blind wearing a camouflage pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists, I believe in Norway, have located, identified, and verified 8,000-year-old Norway spruce trees. ... The oldest living things on the planet. The good news is that takes some of the heat off John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to some of the political blogs, Democratic operatives have been looking for dirt on John McCain since February. You know what you call someone who digs up dirt on John McCain? An archaeologist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And earlier this evening, President Bush made an appearance on the TV show 'Deal or No Deal.' ... I guess he got turned down for 'Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an interview, First Lady Laura Bush...said she cannot fall asleep without reading. ... As opposed to her husband, who can't read without falling asleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of reading, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld now working on a book about his strategy for the war in Iraq. It will be a while before it goes to the publisher because he just doesn't know how to end it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a survey just out today, half the workforce in LA is immigrants. Yeah, the other half are hiding out, waiting for the survey people to leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs President Bush Has Too Much Time On His Hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Spends most of the day looking for friends on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Stops by Cheney's office every five minutes to see if he's still alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Calls leaders of foreign countries yelling, 'Baba Booey! Baba Booey!' (Listen to 'The Howard Stern Show' exclusively on Sirius Satellite Radio.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Earlier today, he washed and waxed Air Force One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Doing a three-episode stint as a sexy assistant on 'How I Met Your Mother.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The primary tomorrow&quot; is &quot;in Pennsylvania,&quot; and Hillary Clinton &quot;is trying to appeal to the working class so today she was campaigning in her blue collar pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you like John McCain? John McCain looks like the kind of guy that doesn't pick the phone up until the 12th ring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the kind of guy who has a cupboard full of canned peaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the kind of guy who thinks the cleaning woman will love any crap he's tossing out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the Howie Mandel blockbuster...game show 'Deal or No Deal'? Earlier tonight, appearing on 'Deal or No Deal,' President Bush. ... Meanwhile, over at ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars,' Dick Cheney collapsed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But...Bush was on 'Deal or No Deal.' Apparently, he didn't feel he was ready for 'Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush made a special taped appearance on the game show 'Deal or No Deal.' ... Yeah. Afterwards, Bush said, 'I like this show because randomly pointing at boxes is how I make decisions too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was April 20th, which&quot; has &quot;become the unofficial holiday honoring marijuana. ... Yeah. It was supposed to be April 16th, but they totally spaced.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what is going on in the world. Well, oil at an all time high&quot; of &quot; $117 a barrel, global warming its worst in history, smog choking the people of China -- Happy Earth Day, everybody. Good night!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, of course, Earth Day,&quot; which is &quot;very big in Hollywood. This is the only place in the world where people talk about energy conservation while staring in a makeup mirror that has 20 light bulbs on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama celebrated Earth Day by throwing mud at each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's the new environmental trend? Green funerals,&quot; where they &quot;put you in, like, just a burlap bag,&quot; which goes &quot;in a shallow grave in a natural setting. Now, didn't that used to be called a mob burial? I think the...people of New Jersey have led the way here for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And scientists now predicting an earthquake will hit California some time in the next 30 years. ... Hey, what else are they predicting -- rain in Seattle, fog in London -- you think maybe? Ooh, how about snow in Alaska? These guys are good!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, of course, Passover week, which started -- I guess it started Saturday and it lasts for eight days. And again,&quot; President Bush &quot;tries to get into the spirit of the Jewish holiday,&quot; but &quot;I don't think he understands. Like, I understand he spent all day coloring matzo balls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, working on a new book about his strategy for the war in Iraq. The book just came out. We have a first copy here. It's called, 'Don't Blame Me. It Was Cheney's Idea.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also in Washington this week, President Bush named a new HUD chief. Bush says he wants to reverse the direction of HUD. Now, if you reverse HUD, you get DUH. Exactly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US military says they're now accepting more new recruits with felony convictions. ... I guess they figure if it's okay for the Bush White House, it should be okay for the US Army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the presidential campaign? ... I'm no political expert, but here is the problem with what the Democrats are doing. They're spending too much time attacking one another and not enough time trying to rig the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton &quot;is trying to convince the people in Pennsylvania that she's a hunter. She's been campaigning all month in Pennsylvania,&quot; so &quot;she shows up the campaign events wearing her beaver pelt pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today is Earth Day. In honor of Earth Day, I'm doing tonight's program with absolutely no energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this morning, Hillary Clinton...said she will stay in the presidential race even if she loses the Pennsylvania primary. Yeah. She also said she'll stay in the race even if she loses the nomination and November's election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say that Barack Obama is attracting mostly younger voters, while Hillary Clinton is attracting much older voters. ... They may be right because today John McCain said he's voting for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, congratulations, Hillary Clinton. She won the Pennsylvania primary by more than ten points. Barack Obama got beaten so badly, today, he offered Hillary the spot of vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least the bright side for Barack -- he doesn't have to go bowling anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, Hillary was thrilled that she had a double digit victory. Bill said he hadn't Hillary this happy since before he married her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, even though she won yesterday, you know, Hillary Clinton's campaign now $10 million in debt. ... Yeah. And ironically, her big issue, 'I can handle the economy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, earlier this week, all three presidential candidates made appearances on the WWE's 'Monday Night Raw.' How many think having candidates for president appear on a wrestling show cheapens the political process? How many...think the wrestling show was cheapened by having the candidates on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Monday night, President Bush made a surprise appearance on the TV show 'Deal or No Deal.' Yesterday morning, First Lady Laura Bush was a guest host on 'The Today Show.' I understand tomorrow, Vice President Dick Cheney is set to play his own evil twin on 'Days of Our Lives.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain is now beginning a campaign to try and attract African-American voters. Now, McCain says that although he never marched with Martin Luther King, he did march with General Sherman through the South during the Civil War. So that's got to count for something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal officials are now investigating whether a site in New Jersey could be a health hazard because it contains high levels of toxic material. The name of the site -- New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And PETA, you know the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, say that eating meat causes more global warming than automobiles. ... I still eat meat, but only if it was hit by a hybrid. Then, I think it's safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report in...'USA Today,' air travel is now slower than any time in the past 20 years. I'm not just talking about delays on the ground, the planes are actually flying slower in the sky now. Now how fat are we getting in this country? We can't even keep airplanes airborne anymore. What is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Ways George W. Bush Can Improve His Approval Rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Fewer embarrassing gaffes, more humiliating blunders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Ask father for tips on how he achieved his 31% approval rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hide Cheney's medication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the price of gasoline. Isn't it making you crazy? ... I spent $80 at the gas station today,&quot; and &quot;that was just to fill my lighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic&quot; presidential race &quot;is dragging on and on and on, but the Democrats are trying to put a good face on this.&quot; They &quot;say now absolutely they will have a...nominee by McCain's second year in office. So they're ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary is very confident. She says she's ready for the 3:00 a.m. phone call and McCain says he's ready for the 3:00 p.m. nap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was &quot;a big victory for Hillary Clinton&quot; in Pennsylvania. Talk &quot;about your back to the wall there. I mean, my gosh, and she wins by 10 points. And so now, she went crazy at the celebration. She downed a shot and fired a gun in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one talks about John McCain anymore because he won his side of the thing pretty much, and now he's just wandering around. ... So he's trying to do things to get press,&quot; and this week, he &quot;is on a tour of what he calls forgotten places in America,&quot; which &quot;at his age means just about everywhere.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Hillary Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary yesterday. ... It was a big night of celebration for the Clinton camp, but they still face some serious money problems. Even in her victory speech last night, Hillary pretty much begged people to go to her website. If only she knew a wealthy former president who made $30 million from his autobiography.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, hey! Big announcement today from the Hillary Clinton campaign. She says if you count the votes that don't count, she's winning!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, this campaign is very tough on the Democrats because they have to fight it out even longer. See, McCain, the only thing he has to fight now is irregularity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we're learning more and more about the effects of global warming. They're now saying, because of temperature shifts, it will be harder to grow hops and grain and the price of beer may soon be raised. ... This is going to be an economic nightmare, especially if you're a beer-drinking SUV owner who just bought a house with a subprime loan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's allegedly a rice shortage. Have you heard about this? To give you an idea how bad it is, the San Francisco treat is now '-A-Roni.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think Americans are affected by a rice shortage? Shut up. A doughnut shortage, we'd be mass-panicked. 'Oh, no rice today? I guess I'm screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Schwarzenegger here on the show tonight&quot; for Green Week. He &quot;believes we should recycle everything, except maybe the movie 'Kindergarten Cop.' That should go directly...to landfill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, even China...pitching in for Green Week. From now on, all toys from China will now be made with recycled lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Famed cardiologist, Dr. Michael DeBakey, was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal yesterday in Washington. DeBakey has performed over 60,000 heart surgeries, 90% of them on Dick Cheney. Pretty amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the owner of Arby's restaurants is going to buy Wendy's restaurants for $2.3 billion. Wendy's and Arby's will combine as one. Their goal? To create the fattest, unhealthiest customer ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Signs Hillary Clinton Is Exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Spends most of her time campaigning in Sleepy's mattress stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Barely has enough energy to lie about battling Bosnian snipers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Last night, spent 2 hours debating a coat rack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Agreed not to dispute Florida and Michigan delegates in exchange for a nap.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When asked how she'd fight terrorism, she said two words: 'Iron Man.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. 3 AM phone call? 'Let the machine get it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. So tired, she actually crawled in to bed with Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this just in. Barack Obama was cleaning out his campaign headquarters in Pennsylvania, you know, after the primary there. And he found a buried Ralph Nader jersey, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the Democratic presidential race? Crazy, isn't it? I mean it goes on and on and on. And now Hillary has the big comeback win in Pennsylvania,&quot; and she is getting &quot;a little cocky. ... She is now saying if she gets that 3:00 a.m. phone call, she's going to let it go to voice mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about John McCain? ... I like John McCain. He looks like a guy who goes grocery shopping and yells at the bag boy. ... 'Put the eggs on top, Junior.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like a guy who still calls the TV the idiot box. 'What are you watching on the idiot box, Junior.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looks like a guy you take shopping and you have to yell into the changing room, 'Everything all right in there, Pop?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the Pennsylvania primary, it seems Barack Obama has kind of resigned himself to a prolonged and potentially ugly battle with Hillary Clinton. Yeah. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, 'Join the club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama...said one of the problems is he needs to attract older voters, and he says he's going to work hard to prove that he understands them. Yeah, and I think he means it, because today, Barack ate dinner at 3:00 in the afternoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been reported that President Bush was so impressed with Pope Benedict's recent visit, that after he leaves office, Bush may convert to Catholicism. ... Yeah, Bush said, 'I'd convert right now, but Dick Cheney freaks out if you get near him with a cross.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the official&quot; in &quot;charge of the 2010 US Census stepped down. ... Yeah, when asked why, the head of the census said, 'I want to spend more time with my 2.4 children.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two brothers from Illinois announced that they have invented a car that gets 100 miles to the gallon. ... Yeah, oil company executives said they're very interested. They would like to meet the brothers in an abandoned warehouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case you didn't know, today was Take Your Child to Work Day or as it's known in China, Thursday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of kids at work, Jenna and Laura Bush...teamed up to write a children's book called 'Read All About It.' The book is designed to encourage kids who don't like to read to read, which is a terrific idea. 'My son doesn't like to read. I don't know what to do.' 'Oh, give him this book.' The apples don't fall far from the very dumb tree, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last night, we had Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the show. You know, I always like having him on, because after we tape the show, I like to go home and watch the closed captioned version so I can find out what he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton said she is a stronger candidate than Barack Obama. And to prove it, she counts the votes she got in Michigan, even though his name wasn't even on the ballot. It's a pretty strong argument. I mean, whenever Barack Obama's name is not on the ballot, she beats him every single time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Barack Obama is suffering from a bad headache today. His former pastor, Reverend Wright, yeah, he is back out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reverend Wright gave an interview earlier tonight on PBS with Bill Moyers. And he said he's gotten over a million e-mails and phone calls telling him to keep on speaking out, and every one of them came from Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, experts say the big test for Barack Obama will be surviving the negative attacks The big test for Hillary Clinton, of course, is surviving North Carolina. The big test for John McCain is just surviving until November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain has spent this week campaigning in what he calls the forgotten areas of the country. He is visiting places that are being ignored by our leaders, places like Pennsylvania now since the primary is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, unfortunately, at McCain's age, as soon as he leaves the forgotten areas, he forgot he was there.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, campaigning in Indiana today, Hillary Clinton, once again, up to her old tricks. She told the crowd that she's a lifelong Colts fan, and recalled that when she was a little girl, her father taught her how to drive an Indy car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government has pulled the plug on the virtual fence it was going to build along the US/Mexican border. Why announce that? Why not just say it's there. At least it will scare off the really stupid people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you believe the news this week, America faces two problems ? an obesity crisis and a food shortage. Now, I'm no genius, but it seems these two pretty much takes care of themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to 'OK!' magazine,&quot; 15-year-old &quot;Miley Cyrus, you know, 'Hannah Montana,' is writing her autobiography. And in one chapter, Miley describes what it's like to deal with the pressures of the adult world when you have the mind of a 13-year-old. Oh, I'm sorry, that's President Bush's autobiography.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks excited about the big presidential campaign? ... Here's a big endorsement. Barack Obama has been endorsed by Bruce Springsteen. Yup. I'm not done. Earlier today, John McCain was endorsed by Yani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like John McCain. ... He looks like the guy that forgets to roll up his windows at the car wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;looks like the guy who yells, 'Okay, who touched the darkness control on the toaster?!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at the White House, President Bush&quot; signed &quot;a proclamation declaring this Malaria Awareness Week. ... There was an awkward moment when, during the ceremony, Bush said, 'This is a great day for all Malarians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts are now saying that one reason Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama in Pennsylvania is because senior citizens prefer her. ... Senior citizens say they like Hillary because if you squint, she kind of looks like Blanche from 'The Golden Girls.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that the $300 rebate we've been promised, the rebate checks from the government, will finally be mailed out on Monday. ... Then, Americans can decide whether to save the $300 or use it to buy half a tank of gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know what is happening tomorrow night? ... I am performing at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in our nation's capital,&quot; and this &quot;is a very, very big deal. This is like the Oscars for ugly people, this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President will be there, and everyone who works for the President will be there too. Dick Cheney will be there. Condoleezza Rice will be there. Fox News will be there. Everyone who works for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you what I'm a bit worried about, that they sat me next to John McCain. I don't want to sit next to John McCain. I don't want to be the one that has to cut his meat into little pieces for him. I don't want to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to be honest. Tomorrow night is going to be a bit awkward for me. I'm a bit nervous, because I'm going to be eating at the same table as the President. It will be the kids' table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I don't know what they're serving for dinner. It's probably chicken or fish, unless Dick Cheney just went hunting, then it is chicken or lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced rebate checks for at least $600. If you have a bunch of kids, it could go up to like, hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to use my check...to buy enough gas to drive to the bank and cash it, and then maybe back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what movie I watched over the weekend? 'Mad Max.' Remember that movie from the '80s, about people trying to kill each other over a few gallons of gasoline? Remember, it took place in the future? It was July, 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, oil prices continue to hit all-time highs. This is hurting a lot of Americans, of course. Everyone except Dick Cheney. Have you noticed, since oil prices went up, he hasn't had one heart attack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration wants our nation's 80 million recreational boaters to help fight terrorism by watching out for small boats that could deliver a nuclear bomb. Well, that should work out well, huh? You've got a bunch of beer-drinking fishermen in bass boats with rifles. What could go wrong there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And boy, it was hot this weekend. Wasn't it? What, triple digits? ... In fact, it was so hot, Hillary Clinton challenged Barack Obama to another debate, just so she could get the cold shoulder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what makes it really uncomfortable? It's not the heat. It's not even the humidity. It's just Al Gore going, 'I told you so.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're following the campaign, you know John McCain is currently on his tour of forgotten places. ... Of course, when you're 71, the room you just walked into is a forgotten place, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama also on a tour of places he'd like to forget, like his church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright,&quot; is &quot;everywhere now. It's like, next week, he's making an appearance on 'How I Met Your Mother.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he's making speeches. He's on the radio. And Reverend Wright says he'd rather just go home and retire, but the money Hillary is paying him is so good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When President Bush appeared on the TV show 'Deal or No Deal' last week, it tied a record for their lowest ratings ever. ... And then, Bush didn't even play the game well. Like, when they asked him to pick a number between 1 and 26, he got it wrong 3 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton now says she wants another debate with Barack Obama. She said, 'The 48th time is the charm,' I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, John McCain campaigned across the state of Florida. ... Yeah, McCain likes campaigning in Florida because everyone there calls him 'the kid.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a strange thing happened this weekend at a big event in Washington, DC. President Bush -- I guess he got excited, so he picked up a baton and he started conducting the US Marine Band. Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately, the President got upset because the band didn't know the song, 'The Wheels on the Bus.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just got back from the nation's capitol.&quot; While &quot;I was there, I was the entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. ... I was very nervous. I was sharing the stage with the most powerful man in the world. Right there, Dick Cheney. Sitting right there. George Bush was there too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to&quot; President Bush &quot;on my way to the podium, 'I'm worried they'll hate me. I'm scared of bombing.' He said, 'You'll get used to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security wants all 80 million of America's recreational boaters to be on the lookout for terrorists in small boats trying to explode a nuclear bomb. I don't believe it. What are we paying, $50 billion a year for homeland security? All they can come up with is three drunks on a waverunner in Lake Havasu?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the State Department announced today the most dangerous place in the world, no longer the Mideast; it is now between Reverend Jeremiah Wright and a microphone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard, Barack Obama's former pastor, Reverend Wright, now traveling the country trying to explain those controversial remarks he made in some of his sermons. And even Barack Obama is starting to admit it's hurting his campaign. In fact, you know what Barack Obama did today to distract reporters from Reverend Wright? Went bowling again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the Republicans will not let this Reverend Wright controversy die. You know, they're trying to keep it in the news. Like, today they said for the wedding of President Bush's daughter, he's going to be the minister.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you sick and tired of the...Democratic presidential primary. I mean, well, Hillary, of course, wants another debate. ... She says she's got nothing more to say really, she just wants to show off a new pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that John McCain? ... I like John McCain. He looks like the kind of guy that walks into Circuit City and says, 'Do you have typewriter ribbons?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night on Fox News, Hillary Clinton is going to be making her first ever appearance on Bill O'Reilly's show, 'The O'Reilly Factor.' Yeah. Yeah, Hillary should do well, because she has years of experience yelling, 'Shut up, Bill!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush gave a news conference about the economy, but he stubbornly refused to say the word recession. ... Instead, President Bush said our country is headed towards something with three syllables that rhymes with refression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'US' magazine says that Nicole Richie has endorsed Barack Obama for president. ... Richie said, 'I'd throw my weight behind him, but I don't have any.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Chinese officials held a ceremony to announce that it's exactly 100 days until the Summer Olympics, and they're working hard to clean up Beijing's pollution. Yeah. Unfortunately, they had to cut the ceremony short, because the air caught on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton announced today she'll appear on 'The O'Reilly Factor.' That should be a great confrontation. On one side, a loudmouthed bully who wants to tear apart the Democratic Party and on the other side, there's Bill O'Reilly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are nine months left in office for President Bush, and he's keeping very busy. Today he held a press conference to talk about the economy. It was a solid press conference for the President. He pronounced the word stimulus correctly almost every single time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And he wouldn't come out and say there was a recession, but he did come out and say that he really doesn't care that much anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And on ABC News tonight, they said gas prices are now flirting with $4 a gallon. Flirting? Huh? Aren't we a little beyond flirting? Aren't we getting screwed at this point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, it is hard to keep up with all these crises we have in America. Remember last week,&quot; when &quot;everybody in America was obese? Remember that? ... This week there's a short food shortage. What happened over the weekend? Did we pig out and eat all the food?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And police in China have discovered that many of the free Tibet banners that these protestors are waving were actually made in China. I guess officials got suspicious when they noticed the banners were made out of lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's sad news from the world of science, ladies and gentlemen. ... Albert Hoffman, sadly, passed away. You probably remember Albert Hoffman was the man who discovered LSD. Yes, that's right. Albert Hoffman was responsible for more bad trips than American Airlines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O' Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has just been accused of trying to avoid questions about the economy, because during yesterday's press conference, he told a reporter that she looked good in yellow and then asked about her baby. Yeah. Even more embarrassing for Bush, the reporter was Wolf Blitzer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday -- this is sad -- Albert Hoffman, the man who invented LSD, passed away at the age of 102. Yeah. Hoffman's funeral will be attended by friends, family, and a giant melting spider.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know ? there's some sad news today. Dr. Albert Hoffmann, inventor of LSD, died today. I know. Or maybe we're dead and he's still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;David Blaine today broke the world record for holding his breath on 'Oprah' -- 17 minutes, four seconds. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at his press conference this week, President Bush blasted congress for not allowing oil exploration in the Alaskan Wildlife Reserve. Democrats said it wouldn't do any good because it wouldn't produce oil for ten years. You know, same thing they said ten years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; the claims made by &quot;Barack Obama's pastor, former pastor, I guess,&quot; are &quot;getting more and more bizarre. ... He now says the high price of gas is due to Dick Cheney and all his friends...Okay, he's right on that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, I filled up at my gas station this morning. Or as I call it, Grand Theft Auto.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today is the 37th anniversary of Amtrak. They were having a big party at Amtrak headquarters. They were wheeling out the cake,&quot; but suddenly, &quot;it overturned and rolled down an embankment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Home Depot announced today they're going to close 15 stores around the US. The reason? Nobody has a home anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all see 'American Idol' Tuesday night? The story is everywhere on the Internet and the radio that Paula Abdul was drinking before she had that meltdown on 'American Idol.' I hope so. Because if she wasn't drinking, that means she's just crazy. Usually when you see somebody named Abdul babbling like that, it's in an al Qaeda video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And some sad news. 'CSI' actor Gary Dourdan&quot; was arrested &quot;in Palm Springs for possession of heroin, cocaine and ecstasy. Heroin, cocaine, and ecstasy. Or as Amy Winehouse calls that, a 'happy meal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Super Bowl&quot; champion New York Giants &quot;met with President Bush at the White House. The Patriots, who the Giants defeated in the Super Bowl, were not at the White House. However, as you know, they sent a guy to videotape it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In the Illinois primary, I accidentally voted for Kucinich.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Throughout high school, I was consistently voted 'Barackiest.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Earlier today I bowled a 39.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. I have canceled all my appearances the day the 'Sex and The City' movie opens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's the birth place of Fred Astaire. (Sorry, that's a surprising fun fact about Omaha.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We are tirelessly working to get the endorsement of Kentucky Derby favorite Colonel John.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Jersey, lawmakers are considering a new tax on fast food. ... Officials say that revenue from the tax will be used to fund social programs in New Jersey like 'No Mullet Left Behind.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a Federal study released today shows that President Bush's $1 billion a year Reading First program has done nothing to increase the reading skills of young students. However, his Oil Company First program -- going like gangbusters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton told 'People' magazine this week she's never had cosmetic surgery. She said that it's not for her. You know how politicians hate anything that's fake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because...John McCain was born&quot; in the &quot;Panama Canal Zone&quot; and &quot;not in the United States, there was a question as to whether he could legally become president. You have to be born here to become president. Well, this week, the Senate declared McCain is eligible to and listen to this, because of his age, also eligible to be a greeter at Wal-Mart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a little bit of history for you. It was this week in 1803 that Thomas Jefferson completed the Louisiana Purchase. That was back in the day when presidents actually cared about what happened to Louisiana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, China inaugurated one of the longest bridges in the world, a 22-mile sea bridge. ... They want to connect the factories that make the toxic lead-based toys directly to the sweat shops where the 9-year-old kids make the sneakers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting? A lot of venture capitalists are now looking at investing in Baghdad. That shows you how bad our economy is. 'Ah, forget it here, let's go to Baghdad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, Hillary Clinton declared she was a lifelong Kentucky Derby fan. When she was a little girl, her dad took her to the Kentucky Derby, where she downed eight mint juleps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was the five-year anniversary of President Bush's speech in front of the 'Mission Accomplished' banner. ... Yeah, to celebrate, today, President Bush gave a speech in front of a banner that said 'Economic Recession Over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe has lost the election, but he refuses to step down, saying he still has a chance to win. That's right. Yeah, Mugabe said he got this idea from Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the head of Home Depot announced that they're closing 15 stores because they were underperforming. Yeah, a spokesperson for Home Depot said, 'Luckily, we've got everything we need to board these places up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll shows that George W. Bush is the most unpopular president in American history. I know! Now I was on TV with that President just last weekend. Coincidence? I hope so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is putting a spin on it, though. They've already issued a statement, and they're like, 'Finally, we are number one in something.' So there's a point, I suppose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People love to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. I saw this one woman throwing back shots of tequila. Boom, boom, one right after another. I found out it was Hillary just working the Latino vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, do you know, Cinco de Mayo is a regional holiday celebrated only in some parts of Mexico? Like Los Angeles and San Diego. I didn't know that.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to a bad Cinco de Mayo party&quot; at Lou Dobbs' &quot;house, and Sean Hannity was the host. Horrible party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the producers of 'Iron Man' are celebrating Cinco de Moola this week. ... Do you know the Chinese already have a pirated copy of 'Iron Man' out on the streets?&quot; You &quot;can tell it's a Chinese copy. Like, Iron Man is made of lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, they celebrated the Worldwide Marijuana March on Saturday. ... The march went almost 200 yards before everybody sat down, smoked a joint, and fell asleep in the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, the Marijuana March, pretty much an all day event. The Methamphetamine March, that lasts about six minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal government announced the economy lost jobs for the fourth straight month in a row. But President Bush tried to turn it around by saying, 'The good news is, we anticipated this.' ... So what is he saying? 'See, I knew I was going to screw up the economy. And guess what. I was right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah. All of a sudden, that response to Hurricane Katrina is starting to make sense now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Pentagon announced a new policy aimed at reducing the stigma associated with seeing a psychiatrist. It says soldiers and military people who need counseling with a psychiatrist will no longer have to mention that when they apply for a job with a high security clearance. I think that's a good policy. Look, if you work for the Pentagon and you buy a hammer for $9,000, you should be able to see a psychiatrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, over the weekend, Microsoft withdrew its offer to buy Yahoo for $46 billion. See, I don't think President Bush understands how these Internet companies work. Like, today he said, 'Why would Microsoft be interested in a watery chocolate drink?' See, I don't think he really knows -- often confusing it with Yoo-hoo, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And sadly, the 'father of LSD' is dead.&quot; He &quot;has died at the age of 102. But the good news, the 'mother of LSD,' still alive and working as a judge on 'American Idol.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Ten Reasons Hillary Clinton Loves America (Editor's note: The list was read by Sen. Clinton).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. We have more Dakotas than every other country combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Canadian bacon: soggy and chewy; American bacon: crisp and delicious!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Thanks to the Internet, I can order new pantsuits 24/7 ? there's your pantsuit joke, Dave. Are you happy now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. 232 years and not one cookie shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. TiVo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Did I mention the soup? Mmmm, soup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Did you know former President Teddy Roosevelt was an American?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where else can you get a car painted for $29.95?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Is this the part where I say, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Apparently anyone can get a talk show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Cinco de Mayo. ... And, of course, the President marked this occasion earlier today. President Bush said that Cinco de Mayo is an opportunity to recognize the strong ties of family, economy and culture that bind the United States and Mexico. That was nice. Yeah. Then the President said, 'Now, let's get back to building that fence.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as I said, Cinco de Mayo's a big day. And in Los Angeles, they celebrated by having a parade through the city. That's right. Yeah, that was nice. In Mexico, they celebrated Cinco de Mayo by having a parade to Los Angeles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's neck and neck with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,&quot; who have &quot;a big primary tomorrow. And they're everywhere right now.&quot; Yesterday's &quot;'Meet the Press' was devoted to...Obama while&quot; the &quot;'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' was devoted to...Clinton. ... Meanwhile, John McCain spent the day watching a 'Golden Girls' marathon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big political news. ... John McCain admitted today he didn't vote for George W. Bush. I know! He did, however, vote for George Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy Cinco de Mayo. ... Cinco de Mayo is a huge holiday in America. It is not such a big deal in Mexico. I guess because more Mexicans live here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Mother's Day is Sunday.&quot; This year, the &quot;dilemma for a lot of guys&quot; is &quot;do you spend $120 on roses for your mom, or do you spend it on gas to go see her?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Indiana and North Carolina held their primaries today. But the Democrats are now saying that Hillary and Barack could be battling for the nomination well into June. Now, aren't they acting more and more like Republicans? Neither one ever them has an exit strategy, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to medical researchers, passing gas, burping and sweating can all help prevent cancer. Boy, that sounds like the Republican healthcare plan, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about the presidential Democratic campaign, the primaries? Whoa, are you kidding me? Today they're in Indiana. My home state. And also...North Carolina. And then, after that, they go to Canada. And then after the Canadian primaries, they go to Europe, they do the European&quot; primaries, &quot;and the election is still three years away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush celebrated Cinco de Mayo at the White House last night,&quot; and &quot;he said, 'We consider ourselves fortunate that Mexico is a friend and a neighbor.' Very nice, yeah. Then Bush said, 'And by 'neighbor,' I mean the kind who climbs over your fence and refuses to leave.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, hundreds...of thousands of people joined in the eighth annual Worldwide Marijuana March.&quot; The march actually &quot;happens every two to three years,&quot; though, because they have a hard time &quot;getting their act together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain isn't resting.&quot; Instead, &quot;he's still trying to&quot; reach &quot;new voters&quot; by starting &quot;a Spanish-language website. He has admitted he doesn't understand any of it, though. I don't mean the Spanish, I mean websites and the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats had two important primaries today in North Carolina and Indiana. And the party could be over for Hillary Clinton. She might have won Indiana, but she lost North Carolina, which is bigger. They're saying now the only way that Obama could possibly lose would be for him to marry Bill Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, this Sunday is Mother's Day. Now, if you haven't gotten your mom a gift yet, can't go wrong with a gallon of gasoline, huh? It's a little pricey, but, hey, you only got one mom, you know?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, yesterday, Barack Obama soundly beat Hillary Clinton in North Carolina by 14 points. And in Indiana, Hillary Clinton won. So you know what this means? No and neither do I. And I don't care anymore. I'm fed up, okay? I don't care who wins. Can we end this stupid thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know what's interesting, the experts say if you do the math, there's no way Hillary Clinton can win the nomination, and today, Hillary responded by saying, 'People who do math are elitist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they use that word a lot in the election, elitist. Here's my question. Didn't elite used to be a good thing? I mean, if you were elite, didn't that mean the best? Don't you want ? 'Oh, no. We don't want anybody elitist.' God forbid we should have decent people doing this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they say the Clinton campaign is out of money, and today, Republicans said, 'How much do you need?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, not looking good for Hillary. Today, even Yogi Berra said, 'It's over.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you can tell Barack Obama is feeling confident. ... Did you see what he did today? He went bowling with his former pastor, Reverend Wright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has offered to help Myanmar. I guess it used to be called Burma. That's where they had that terrible cyclone where thousands of people were killed as the country was hit by a devastating cyclone. In fact, Bush offered to help the country under one condition ? don't tell New Orleans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the 'AARP' magazine, 19% of Americans report eating ice cream in bed. The other 81% didn't even know you were supposed to report it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the founders of Baskin-Robbins ice cream has died at the age of 90 years old.&quot; And &quot;last week, the man who invented LSD...died at the age of 102. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jenna Bush is getting married this weekend at her father's place in Crawford, Texas. And this is no surprise -- the $2 billion ice sculpture contract is with Halliburton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is helping out with the big Jenna Bush wedding. As a matter of fact right now,&quot; Dick Cheney &quot;is waterboarding the groom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, another two primaries yesterday. That's the big story. Very tough night for Hillary Clinton,&quot; who &quot;says she isn't dropping out because there are still six states that haven't had their Democratic primary. That's right. Yep. Barack Obama's favored in the states of Oregon, Montana and South Dakota, and Hillary is favored in the state of denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton's &quot;campaign is running out of money. ... As a matter of fact, today, and this very sad, a collection agency repossessed her pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So here is what happened on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton barely won my home state of Indiana. And she lost in the state of North Carolina. But here is the good news. She has a substantial lead in the state of denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm no pundit, but it occurred to me that Hillary Clinton has one thing in common with President Bush. Neither of them has an exit strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here's what I don't understand about government and politics and stuff like that. ... Earlier today President Bush...asked Congress to okay an additional $50 billion&quot; for &quot;his daughter's wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend...at the Bush family ranch, one of President Bush's daughters will be getting married. ... And I thought this was cute.&quot; The groom &quot;went to President Bush&quot; and &quot;asked...for his daughter's hand in marriage. And president Bush said, 'Well, it's okay with me, but you got to run it by Cheney.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of pressure now on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race.&quot; She did not &quot;do so well in the primaries the other night,&quot; but one of her &quot;advisers says that the chance of Hillary conceding the nomination to Barack Obama and dropping out of the race is only about 10%.&quot; But the adviser &quot;admits that if Obama wins the presidency, that number could go as high as 11%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's wife was recently overheard saying that they own eight or nine homes. ... Yeah, McCain's wife denied this,&quot; however, &quot;and stated, 'What I said is I've tried to put him in a home eight or nine times.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll came out today. It says conservatives like Rush Limbaugh are happier than liberals. Although it might not be happiness. In Limbaugh's case, it might just be the OxyContin kicking in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two congressmen in Washington are calling for hearings on the violence in 'Grand Theft Auto 4.'&quot; But the &quot;game is huge,&quot; with &quot;half a billion dollars in sales&quot; already. That is &quot;more money than Hillary Clinton spent to not get elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama picked up four more superdelegates this week. Those are the party big shots whose votes, for some reason, mean a lot more than our votes mean. Even so, it's nice to see a politician pick up something other than a prostitute every once in a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush's daughter Jenna getting married this weekend in Crawford, Texas. It will be a relatively small wedding. Only her family's loved ones will be there -- the CEOs of the five major oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, that's got to be every girl's dream, don't you think? Getting married in Crawford, Texas? And to add a little icing to the cake, I understand they're going to be honeymooning in Plano.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's an interesting fact about the wedding a lot of people didn't know -- since her father's approval rating is only 29%, she has asked John McCain to give her away. Did you know that?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the most recent exit polls, most people think Hillary Clinton should exit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Hillary says she's staying in the race because there are new patterns emerging, such as lower-educated white men are now supporting her. That's what she said. Polls show she has strong support among lesser-educated white males. So you know what that means -- President Bush could be voting for her now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the latest report, mental illness costs Americans $193 billion a year in lost earnings. ... Well, that's insane. That's...just plain nuts. That's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was going to send my mom something special for Mother's Day, and then I realized that she's already getting that economic stimulus check.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jenna Bush is getting married tomorrow in Crawford, Texas, and Vice President Dick Cheney will be there, so it's going to be a shotgun wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I Don't know if you're aware of this, but there's a fairly serious rice shortage.&quot; So, wedding guests &quot;will be throwing baked potatoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jenna Bush, the President's daughter, is getting married,&quot; but she &quot;didn't sign a pre-nup. Apparently the family doesn't believe in exit strategies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new economic study&quot; that &quot;comes out today...shows that in today's economy, women have an easier time landing a job than men do. Apparently they do. All except Hillary Clinton find it much easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, as reported, some Democrats are quietly sending word to Hillary that it's over,&quot; but Hillary &quot;said she will not give up, she will go to the convention, and she will win.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, did you hear Hillary's new slogan? 'I'm Just In It Now To Annoy The Hell Out Of Everybody.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former congressman Bob Barr entered the race today as a Libertarian. ... See, I don't think Bush understands these terms. When they asked Bush about it, he said, 'I don't care if the guy doesn't eat meat. What does he stand for?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know by now, the President's daughter Jenna got married over the weekend.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney gave the wedding couple a lovely gift. It was an antique gasoline sign that said, 'Gas, $3 a gallon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest word is that China is going to go into the oil business. We could one day get our gasoline from China. Good luck trying to find unleaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's not just drivers that are affected by the price of gas. Today, I saw a gardener trying to blow leaves with a hand fan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. That's very nice of you. ... Really, that makes up for not being invited to Jenna's wedding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mother's Day this weekend. ... I love my mom and I got her a lovely gift,&quot; a &quot; $25 Exxon Mobil gift card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how about that presidential race? Hillary Clinton just won't quit,&quot; but her campaign &quot;is running out of money.&quot; So today, &quot;she was wearing a certified, pre-owned pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you look at this historically, it's not that difficult to believe that Hillary would still be campaigning. Listen to this. Once a year,&quot; in &quot;his basement, Al Gore gives a State of the Union address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody go down to the Crawford ranch for the big Jenna Bush wedding over the weekend?&quot; It was a &quot;lovely affair,&quot; but &quot;do you know there is a rice shortage? ... So after the wedding, they threw caramelized onions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the reception, President Bush danced with his lovely daughter. It's the first time he has led in eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush danced with all the guests. And then Cheney shot the cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend in Texas, President Bush's daughter, Jenna, got married. ... Yep, afterwards, President Bush said, 'I haven't cried that much since Steve left 'Blue's Clues.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, everyone, apparently, had a very good time at the wedding. And afterwards, the press asked him and President Bush said it was, 'spectacular.' Yeah, when asked why, President Bush said, 'Three words: the Chicken Dance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Director Oliver Stone is making a movie about President Bush that's called 'W.' ... He's also making a movie about John McCain called 'No Country for Old Men.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steven Spielberg says that his next feature film will be a biography of President Abraham Lincoln. ... You can tell the Lincoln film is by Spielberg, because instead of getting shot, Lincoln and a baby dinosaur ride a bicycle past the moon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man in Oregon has caused a controversy, because he's written a children's book about marijuana. ... Yeah, the book's called 'Horton Hears the Cops.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, money is so tight in her campaign, I understand&quot; that &quot;today, she was wearing a rented pantsuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political experts say Hillary Clinton will soon have to face the moment of truth. That's what they called it today, 'the moment of truth.' See, I love politics. They campaign and lie to us for six months, but we only get a moment of truth. Why can't we have a little more truth?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know this talk about vice president. You've heard this rumor going around. George Stephanopoulos on ABC said that Hillary would accept the vice presidency, but under certain conditions. Like, if Barack Obama was to get really, really sick, maybe then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, Barack Obama slipped up this past week. You know, this campaigning is ? it's endless, it's hard. Like, in an interview, he said he had campaigned in all 57 states. That's what he said. But, see, they all make mistakes. Like Hillary Clinton, the only two states she knows are Florida and Michigan. And John McCain, he still thinks there's only 13 colonies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush announced this week&quot; that &quot;he will go Saudi Arabia and meet with King Abdullah. That's got to be nerve-wracking for President Bush, huh? Being called to the carpet by the big boss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how low President Bush's approval rating is right now, at his daughter's wedding last weekend, he wasn't in any of the photos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jenna Bush and her husband, Henry Hager, are honeymooning in Europe right now. ... And President Bush is nothing if not consistent. Like, he said, there's no timetable for bringing them home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this weekend, the price of a first class stamp rose to 42 cents. Forty-two cents to mail a letter. If there was only some other way you could get a written message to someone. Ah! They've got us over a barrel!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now let's talk for a second about the presidential race, the Democratic campaign, the primaries -- it's getting a little tiresome, don't you think?&quot; And the &quot;election is still three years off. And they have all the Canadian primaries left. Then of course they go to Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it takes &quot;a lot of money to elect a president.&quot; In fact, &quot;Hillary Clinton's campaign, right now, this very minute, $20 million in debt. Now when she gets that 3:00 a.m. call, it's from a collection agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they're not even pretending. Hillary Clinton is so broke now,&quot; some &quot;friends of mine spotted her in the middle of the night last night at a laundromat...with a hamper full of pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, big primary tonight in West Virginia, that's the story. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton slugging it out. And I guess -- I don't know if Barack Obama's getting tired or what, but in a recent speech,&quot; he &quot;said he had visited all 57 states. ... Yeah, after hearing this, President Bush said, 'Ha-ha, he forgot Alaska and Hawaii.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
