<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend in Florida, six more people bitten by sharks. Six more. Well, since it's Florida, they're still counting. They're not really sure yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot today, Al Gore said, 'Screw the ozone, turn up the damn air conditioner.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so hot, Dick Cheney unzipped his chest all the way down to the navel today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush continuing with the endless vacation that he's on. You know, we need a new holiday in this country. We need 'Take your President to work' day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because he doesn't want to set the record for being on vacation longer than any other President in history, Bush announced this week he's ending his month-long vacation three days early. He's coming home three days early. He's coming back August 31st. August 31st is the Friday before Labor Day weekend, isn't it? Huh? So he's coming back to work on Friday, what, knock off early, maybe. Woo! 2:00, 2:30. Then go to Camp David for some R&amp;R.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we found the one world leader who works less than Prince Charles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching our sister station, MSNBC, yesterday, and the lead story on MSNBC was the news that there was nothing new to report in the Gary Condit story. That was the news, that there was nothing new to report. So remember, when there's nothing new to report, NBC will be the station not to report it first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, just two hours ago, Gary Condit agreed to an interview with Connie Chung on Thursday night. He's going to talk in front of the nation. And I wonder, how did Connie Chung get this? Well, apparently -- remember last week, Connie Chung interviewed Jesse Jackson's mistress? Apparently, she gave her Condit's home number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is also that Gary Condit's wife will be there. She doesn't want to be interviewed. No, no, no. It's just from now on, she's gonna be there whenever Gary talks to another woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the new Al Gore? He's wearing a beard. Have you seen Al Gore wearing a beard? He's hoping that the rabbi look will help him next time in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the Gary Condit saga? I just found out Gary Condit is hiding out now in Modesto, California. So now he's disappeared. Usually it's just people he's dating that disappear. But now he's actually disappeared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So after months and months and months of dodging the press, he has dropped out of sight and gone into seclusion with his family...no, wait, I'm sorry, that's President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush.says he needs a month off to unwind. Unwind? When the hell does this guy wind?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think about it, he might as well be on vacation, because, really, the only thing he has to do yet this year, I guess, is, you know, light the White House Christmas Tree, and then that will be it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush &quot;went to Wisconsin, he went to a Harley Davidson factory, and he rode a motorcycle. And I think it's the biggest thing a President has ridden since...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton turned 55 over the weekend. And Bill spent the day with his loved ones and then Hillary popped out of the cake and yelled, 'Got you, fat ass!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about all these shark attacks off the coast of Florida? It's getting scary. You get the feeling maybe God is still mad about the election, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the day after tomorrow, Gary Condit will be interviewed by Connie Chung on ABC's Primetime Thursday. Ew! Clean the screen for that one, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Condit's &quot;people said today he was considering giving the interview to Ed Bradley or Stone Phillips, but he decided if you're gonna lie to someone, he's more comfortable doing it with a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Connie's gonna be alone with him -- 30 minutes with Gary Condit. 30 minutes, alone with him. Sounds like a bad episode of 'Fear Factor,' doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, at her own station, Connie Chung beat out both Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer for the interview. She beat them. Well, today, an ABC News spokesman said that both Barbara and Diane are very happy that Connie got it. Boy, you thought Condit was a good liar, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope Condit makes the interview on time. Remember, he threw his watch in the dumpster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, though, a lot of interest. Even President Bush is gonna watch. In fact, today, Bush asked a reporter, 'Hey, what night is Primetime Thursday on?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he'll return to the White House on August 31st or possibly the 32nd. He's not sure, depending on his schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's coming home early from his month-long -- who takes a -- besides homeless people, who has a month off?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today, the White House announced that on August 26th, George W. Bush will become the first President in history to attend the championship game of the Little League World Series. Huh? I see Dick Cheney's finally giving Bush a little more responsibility, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;State police in Philadelphia have arrested a 45-year-old man who beat up Hillary Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham. You know Tony Rodham? He's married to Barbara Boxer's daughter, the senator from California. This guy caught Tony having sex with his girlfriend in a hotel room. Just wailed the guy, just beat him up. And today, Hillary issued a statement saying she is in shock -- shock that her husband Bill was not involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, at least Bill had the class to wait till the husband left the room. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks been following the Congressman Gary Condit saga? Quite a guy, huh? Piece of work, don't you think? Apparently now he's in seclusion, and he's back in Modesto, and he's rambling around in his big, huge house kind of talking to nobody there, and I said to myself, 'It's like I have a twin.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Connie Chung will be interviewing Gary Condit, I guess sometime this week. And he set up...here are the rules for the Gary Condit interview. He wants to wear a ski mask. He'll be wearing dark glasses, and will only answer to the name Kurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is all part of Gary Condit trying to make a comeback. He's also going to be appearing on 'Primetime Glick.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interview will take place at an undisclosed location. Undisclosed location. Isn't that where his dates usually end up?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about Hillary Clinton's brother? It's not Hugh, it's Tony. Did you hear about this story? Apparently he's got, like, a vacation house somewhere in Pennsylvania, and he gets beat up, see? Because he's having sex with somebody's fiance. Yeah, and I'm thinking, boy, this Clinton's a lucky guy, if you think about it, you know what I mean? Really. It's hard to find a brother-in-law who has the same interests as you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story, in C-minus students rule the world, President George W. Bush took time out from his busy vacation schedule to talk to a crowd in Independence, Missouri, at Truman Middle School. . Bush spent most of the day wondering how they knew Harry Truman was going be President when they named the school after him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the guy who was in charge of the airport in 'Die Hard 2' news, former actor and now Sen. Fred Thompson with the pie in the face treatment from the Tennessee Titans during a visit to training camp. Gary Condit, that is a dignified politician right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow night's the big night. As you know, Gary Condit will appear on ABC's 'Primetime Slime' tomorrow night, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that Connie Chung will interview the Congressman. But she only has him for one 30-minute interview. And as the police have already shown us, it takes at least three interviews before Condit even thinks about telling the truth. 30 minutes. I know it doesn't seem like much, but it's still 15 more minutes than he ever spent with his own wife, so that's pretty good.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they said the interview will be totally unedited. It's gonna be what they call 'lie to videotape.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And no ground rules. ABC said no ground rules for this. No ground rules at all. Unless, of course, Gary gets Connie on the ground. Then they will step in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush announced he's cutting his vacation short by yet another day. Whoo, take a break, fella!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why Bush is coming back two days early now? The fishing hole on his ranch is dried up. See, that's when you know you've been on vacation a long time, okay? When entire bodies of water just start drying up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they keep calling this a working vacation. You know, every time you see Bush, he's having fun. He's playing golf. He's riding horses. He's jogging. You know, to everybody else, that's summer camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton's brother Tony Rodham was beaten up by a guy who caught him having sex with his girlfriend. Isn't that great? So it looks like Connie Chung has found next week's interview, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy goes in, beats him up because he's having sex with his girl. See, that's why Hillary has stuck with Bill all these years. He's like a brother to her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the cops said Tony Rodham was so swollen from the beating, they thought it was Hugh Rodham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's the part where it gets very weird, okay? Tony Rodham is married to the daughter of Barbara Boxer, one of Hillary Clinton's fellow senators. This is like a bad episode of 'Washington, 90201.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Palm Beach on the news today, they were showing people how to fend off a shark attack, how to defend yourself against a shark. Palm beach? Palm beach? These are the same people who, last November, couldn't figure out how to punch a hole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Sharpton says he's going to run for President of the US. I don't know. President Al Sharpton, huh? Good luck getting that giant head on a coin, huh? How are they gonna put that -- you're gonna need a nickel the size of a hubcap now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI busted a conspiracy that rigged the Monopoly game at McDonald's. Hey, you gotta hand it to the FBI. They might not know how to catch the guy stealing our nuclear secrets, but when it comes to somebody trying to get a free bag of fries - 'Come on! We got him!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McDonald's, you know, they got some good news today. When Bush found out about them rigging the contest, he said, 'Okay, I'd like you to handle the next election in Florida.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thursday night, Connie Chung will interview Gary Condit and then Friday morning, the police will interview Gary Condit. 'Mr. Condit, when was the last time you saw Connie Chung?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm looking forward to the interview. It's been a long time since we've seen a philandering politician hold his wife's hand on TV, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Connie, understandably -- like this is a journalistic coup -- she's very, very excited about it. She's getting ready for the interview. She's got a brand-new outfit, I read. She's got some, like, makeup ready to go. She's got a new can of pepper spray. She's set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, let's see what the hell is he doing. Oh, he's still on a working vacation. I believe it will come to an end January 20, 2005. That will be it for the working vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, what a working vacation is? That's where they mix business with pleasure. It's the same kind of thing Clinton used to do at his desk!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is still on vacation at his ranch. I saw him on a horse in a cowboy hat the other day and I thought what a great country where my President, if he tries hard enough, can grow up to be a little boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Tonight Show. Nice to have you here. Well, it is 11:35 -- Maury Povich, you know where your wife is, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, they had the big interview on ABC, which of course stands for 'Anybody Believe Condit?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are wondering why Gary Condit agreed to be on '20/20.' I guess an appearance on 'To Tell the Truth' is pretty much out of the question, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why I think he agreed to the interview? The real reason? So the next morning, tomorrow morning, he can go around telling his buddies, 'Yeah, I did Connie Chung last night.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even before the interview, Gary Condit requested a special padded chair. Did you hear about this? Because he wanted to be comfortable 'cause, you know, he knew he'd be lying his ass off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you all get your letter from Gary Condit? I got mine. See, I knew it was his letter before I opened it just from the cologne, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the actual letter he sent out. You probably got one of these: 'You may already be my mistress.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his letter, Condit said he hadn't spoken publicly 'cause he didn't want to turn this case into a spectacle. Well, that worked out well, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now reporting that the government budget surplus -- just about gone. That's it. So if you haven't cashed your $300 tax rebate check, you better do it soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, Linda Tripp claims that she's broke, out of work and badly in debt. Yeah, well, she's sending out a mailing to Republicans asking them to pressure President Bush to find her work. Bush finding work? Bush can't even find work for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, beaten up by a guy who caught him having sex with his girlfriend. How did this happen? Isn't that great? When does that happen? Does that happen anywhere that you don't have wheels on your house now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, Bill Clinton said he was shocked -- shocked. He said he didn't know anybody on Hillary's side of the family even had sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what Tony Rodham said today? And this is the New York Times. Listen to this -- he claims they were just good friends. They weren't having sex. They were just good friends, and they were just sleeping on the couch. What is this, high school?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know where Clinton was this week? Vegas. Clinton in Vegas. Boy, is that an accident waitin' to happen, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He went to see Siegfried and Roy. This is true -- he went to see their show. No, he went backstage, Siegfried and Roy let him pet a Siberian tiger. And out of force of habit, Clinton denied there was any petting involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state of California ruled today that topless dancers do have a constitutional right to be able to touch, caress and fondle their own bodies while they dance. Are we the greatest country in the world or what? Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry, I'm a little late getting out here. I was backstage watching Gary Condit lie his ass off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the Gary Condit/Connie Chung interview over there on ABC, well, it's over and just about now, police cadets are searching the woods for Connie Chung and...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Condit is a piece of work. He says now that he has watched the interview he did with Connie Chung, and now he says he actually believes he didn't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when this whole thing first began, he was not really cooperative, and so to make everybody feel better, he gave himself a lie detector test. He passed. That's right, and then...and then...and then, later, he actually tried to beat a confession out of himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you watch the Gary Condit interview, three words come to mind: 'stiff, unbending, and impenetrable.' And that's just his hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Condit's goal tonight, his goal, his reason for doing the interview, he wants to clear his good name so he can start dating again. That's the goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this? President Clinton got a book deal, $12 million? Whhoo! Bubba's going to write a book. It's unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being published by Simon and Shyster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday Bill Clinton was out there in Las Vegas. He had a speaking engagement -- oh, boy. And he went to see Siegfried and Roy. And by the way, Siegfried and Roy -- aren't they the only couple stranger than Bill and Hillary?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is August 24, which means we are almost just about entering the autumn portion of George Bush's vacation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard this? 79 years old Jesse Helms is retiring. He...Jesse is at an awkward age. He's really...too old to run again, and he's too young to watch CBS. You see, at an awkward kind of thing. He just doesn't know what to do with himself.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God, last night, how many of you saw the Gary Condit interview with Connie Chung over on ABC last night? How many of you saw that? Well, it was quite a coup for ABC and for Connie Chung. But, I'm proud to say, not to be outdone, Dan Rather, right here on CBS, tonight, is going bass fishing with Hugh and Tony Rodham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But ABC, you know, they're not kidding around. They weren't taking any chances. Before the interview, they fitted Connie Chung with Lojack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit now is trying to rehabilitate himself publicly and politically, and insiders say that what he's really worried about now, if he has to quit, if he has to leave the Congress, he'll lose his pension, you know what I'm saying? That's interesting. The guy has no problem losing an intern, but he's worried about his pension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interview with Connie Chung was an historic broadcast, because for a full 30 minutes, for the first time, Condit's wife actually knew the woman he was with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So this guy is what they call a serial adulterer, and his wife is forgiving him, and they're on television holding hands. This guy could be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit was interviewed by Connie Chung. Finally, a Democrat who makes Clinton look classy. There we go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first question Connie asked is, 'Why is your hand on my thigh?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most dramatic information came halfway through when Condit was forced to reveal he uses the same stylist Jack Lord did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the interview, Condit drove off to have dinner at Vitello's in his white Bronco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent poll says 84% of viewers think Condit is lying and 16% think he's not telling the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a related story, Connie's husband, Maury Povich, snagged an interview with an unwed cross-dressing Elvis impersonator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our top story in the 'jokes that write themselves' news, President George Bush continued his month long vacation in Waco, Texas, by playing a first round of golf. A mulligan on the first round. That's a good analogy for his presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, did you hear this? Robert Blake has canceled his interview with Connie Chung.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the Gary Condit interview with Connie Chung? How many of you? I'm telling you, I watched this thing, and I sat close to the TV so I wouldn't miss nothing. And he was evasive, he was crafty, he was defensive, but on the other hand, I thought he was just plain creepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Condit &quot;comes off so shifty and so weasely, even if he did confess, people would still think he was lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, back at the apartment he has a lie detector machine. So he gave himself a lie detector test and it turns out he passed. Yes, he passed the test.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then later, as the story progressed, later there was a lot more controversy. So here's what he did, he tried to beat a confession out of himself. That didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have got to understand a guy in this position, he's very defensive, very, very defensive and I think his defense is getting more and more desperate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Bill Clinton is &quot;down there in Rio de Janeiro and he, apparently, there's a big picture of him in the paper, he's out there on the beach with his shorts and his big fat stomach, and he's staring at topless women.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big news. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know if you read the papers today, but President Bush is in some big trouble. Have you heard this? No, President Bush is in some big trouble. I don't know if you saw this, but 'The New York Times' reported today that President Bush's approval rating is the worst it's ever been. The worst. Yeah, when asked about it, the President said, 'I haven't seen numbers this low since I took the SATs'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what? Gary Condit will be barbecuing this weekend. You know Gary Condit? He has one of those aprons that reads, 'I've been married for 34 years, I've made some mistakes, I'm not a perfect man.' I think the kids got that for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then on Tuesday, Condit flies back to Washington. You know, he has to meet the fall interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he'll be flying back from California. You know what that means. He'll be picking up another flight attendant, so there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember when President Bush said, 'I'm going away on a 30-day vacation,' we just all laughed silly, like, 'What? Really? 30 what?' And he said, yeah, he needs some time to unwind. And we said... 'When the hell do you wind, for God's sakes?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like President Clinton now will get his own radio show. And he's got a lot of ideas for the radio show, President Clinton. For example, if you're the tenth caller, you get a free pardon. I think that's pretty good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actual letters from actual letter writers. Here we go. 'Dear Dave, do you think Gary Condit could ever get reelected? Will Foreman, Middletown, Connecticut.' . Well, you know, I would guess that the voters in Gary Condit's district are not too pleased with him, especially when you look back at the commercials that he ran during his last campaign. Yeah, we've got an old commercial from the 2000 campaign. It's a Gary Condit campaign ad from the year 2000 election. Take a look. 'Congressman Gary Condit -- for the past 11 years he's worked hard for northern California. If reelected, he will make good on these three promises: He will fight to lower taxes. He will improve the quality of California schools. And under no circumstances will he have an illicit affair with an intern who ends up mysteriously disappearing and then lie about the whole thing on national television to Connie Chung. That's the Condit guarantee. Paid for by the Committee to Reelect Gary Condit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Labor Day, &quot;everybody's having a barbecue. Down in Washington, Congressman Gary Condit, you know -- well, police spent two hours grilling him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then Condit &quot;had his own barbecue, and it was a huge success. Only two women are missing, so that's pretty good for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Labor Day is the day when we honor hardworking people in America. So let's take a moment to thank all those hardworking people by saying, 'Gracias, amigos.' Yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spent Labor Day giving a speech to the Teamsters in Detroit. You know, he really is dyslexic. He's the only guy I know who takes a month off and then works on Labor Day.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know last week, President Bush was inducted into the Little League Hall of Fame. How about that? Now, is it me, or have we kind of lowered the bar? Little League Hall of Fame? Remember when Presidents used to get like the Nobel Peace Prize?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexican President Vicente Fox will make his first state visit to Washington, DC, tomorrow. It's the Mexican President's first official state visit. He snuck across a couple of times on his own, but this is his first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite story of the week. I love this story. It seems Bill Clinton -- you see this on the news? -- Clinton was in Rio de Janeiro with actor Anthony Hopkins, and the TV camera caught Clinton buying a bikini and a thong. And let me tell you something -- if Hillary can't squeeze into that thing, he's got a lot of explaining to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton and Anthony Hopkins, two of the greatest actors of our time, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And last week, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the New York state fair together, and one kind of embarrassing moment -- I guess just for fun, Bill entered the hog-calling competition, and three of his former girlfriends showed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And former first brother Roger 'I'm Innocent' Clinton -- listen to this. Did you hear about this? Roger Clinton has admitted to accepting a Rolex watch from the Gambino crime family. And it turns out, it's a special edition Rolex that keeps track of time served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, when Roger first got caught with the watch, he called Gary Condit to ask him the best place to throw the box away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Congressman Gary Condit's home was pelted with eggs. And I love our local news here on NBC. Last night on our local -- or Sunday night, our local NBC news said, 'This could be a sign that his support is waning.' Really, you think so? I mean, when your constituents drive by and throw garbage at your house, you think that's a sign that maybe you're not as popular? Maybe this isn't Condit Country anymore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Jeb Bush of Florida said today that these shark attacks are not that bad. He's like the guy from 'Jaws' - 'It's a boating accident!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he says it's the media's exaggerated obsession with these attacks, and it's hurting tourism. Of course, he made these comments on land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's your tax dollars at work, folks. Here's the government working for you. Seems a new government survey says that many people in the South have gone from living in poverty to just being poor. Well, that should make 'em feel a lot better, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after 33 years on TV, 'Mister Rogers' taped its last episode last week. It is kind of sad. Mister Rogers is gone. I mean, who's gonna help President Bush tie his shoe every day now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it's time now for our nightly 'Janet Reno for Governor' spot of the night.&quot; Narrator: &quot;Why should you elect Janet Reno governor of Florida?&quot; &quot;Janet Reno&quot;: &quot;Cause I'll kick those sharks' butts like I did in Waco. Take that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno announced today she's going to run for governor of Florida in 2002. Can you believe that? She's gonna run. Big, big, big election. Not only that, there will also be a referendum where Florida voters can vote on Reno's gender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of politics, yesterday, President Bush addressed a crowd of union leaders, and he said he understands the economy is making things tough right now. That's what he said -- he understands. In fact, the President said, 'I know what it's like to be out of work, I was just on vacation for a month.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina has announced he's going to retire from the US Senate in two years. Helms said he wants to retire so he can spend even more time hating gays and foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a very successful summer. I was not attacked by a shark...or a publicist...or a congressman, so I'm feeling very lucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit is back in Washington, and his wife now is doing everything she can to keep him in line, and today, she installed a motion detector in his pants!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say what you will about Gary Condit, but there is a guy who knows how to end a summer romance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno is going to run for governor of Florida. Yeah, she made the official announcement during a surprise predawn press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Reno's going to run and she's taking kind of a hint from Al Gore -- she's growing a beard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted Mexican President Vicente Fox at the White House. And after talking to him for a while, he said, 'Your English is getting better.' And Bush said, 'Oh, thank you. Gracias.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economic picture not looking too good. They're now saying, unless a budget deal is reached in the next 25 days, the government will shut down on September 30th. That's it. If that happens, they send home all nonessential government employees. More vacation time for Bush.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Janet Reno announced that she is running for governor of Florida. So it's nice to see the Miami Dolphins let her out of her contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Jeb Bush says that these recent rash of shark attacks in Florida -- he says they're nothing. He says it's not that bad. And here's the scary part -- he's considered the smart Bush brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit's house got pelted with eggs over the weekend. Just pelted with eggs. Actually, it happened 12 weeks ago. He just now got around to reporting it to the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gary Condit's parents told their local newspaper today Satan is to blame for their son's problems. . Satan. Well, today, Satan said, 'Hey, I don't even know Gary Condit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Late last week, one of Gary Condit's top political and media consultants resigned. The guy just quit, which shocked me. Gary Condit has consultants, huh? Kind of makes you wonder how bad he would have looked with Connie Chung if he hadn't had all those experts working for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN reporting that, today, Gary Condit's Democratic colleagues in Congress are deserting him. They say he should have been 'more truthful.' See, there's Washington's 'think talk' for you. . That's a Washington word - 'more truthful.' It's either the truth, or it's a lie. Isn't it, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, with politicians, they think the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth -- that's three different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IRS says it may have misplaced $810 million in income tax payments we mailed in. They can't find them. They lost $810 million of our money. You know what we should do? We should have the IRS come down to our office with their little shoe box full of receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, President Bush had dinner with President Vicente Fox of Mexico. Big dinner. Apparently the dinner didn't go very well, because Bush kept asking Fox why he left 'Spin City.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Attorney General Janet Reno has announced that she's going to run for governor of Florida against President Bush's brother Jeb. Yeah, apparently Reno's campaign slogan will be 'Let the best man win.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the kitchen staff at the White House, President Bush ends most of his meals by eating a dessert of Oreo cookies. Yeah, apparently he got the idea from President Clinton, who would end each meal by having a threesome with two black women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over there on NBC they have a show called 'Lost.' Do you know what that is? Here's what happens, contestants are blindfolded and they are dropped in undisclosed locations. It's like a date with Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit of course is back in Congress, they had their first vote today and I believe Gary Condit voted for more interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Bush is all excited in the White House because this will be their first state dinner and it's for Mexican President Vicente Fox. And even Dick Cheney is thrilled, and in honor of the Mexican President he had his pacemaker reset to a salsa beat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's exciting news: Janet Reno is running for governor of Florida. It was either that or DH for the Devil Rays.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he had a pretty reasonable explanation. He said today Satan -- Satan is responsible for his son's problems.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An official in the Florida Democratic party said today they couldn't be happier.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted his first state dinner at the White House last night. And the main entree was Maryland crabs. That's what they served. That's right, yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush last week, inducted into the Little League Hall of Fame. Huh, we couldn't be prouder as a country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says what makes him proudest of this award -- this time, the election was not rigged. Got it on his own.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study shows that many people in the South have gone from living in poverty to just being poor. That's what it said. Of course, that was just last month, when they got their tax rebates. See, that's part of the Republicans' one-month war on poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more calls today for Gary Condit to get off the intelligence committee. I'd be happy if he'd just get off the interns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit's father, who's a reverend.Jimmy Swaggart, I think, is his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he had a pretty reasonable explanation. He said today Satan -- Satan is responsible for his son's problems. Well, earlier today, Connie Chung interviewed Satan.&quot; &quot;Satan&quot; was shown saying, &quot;Well, Connie, I could not have been involved with the Condit thing because I was too busy with Clinton at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An official in the Florida Democratic party said today they couldn't be happier. They say they are very turned on by the fact that Janet Reno is entering the race, which is a start. This is the first time the words 'Janet Reno' and 'turned on' have ever been used together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, President Bush back from his nine month vacation, I believe it was. He was at a Chuck E. Cheese the whole time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush hosted his first state dinner at the White House last night. And the main entree was Maryland crabs. That's what they served. That's right, yeah. And reportedly, these were the first crabs at the White House since the Clinton Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a new interview, Gary Condit's father says that the devil is to blame for his son's problems. The devil's fault is what the dad said. Yeah, and immediately afterwards, Satan denied all responsibility and called Condit a slimeball.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, in the Oval Office, President Bush will toss the coin that will open ten NFL games across the country. Huh? Who says this guy doesn't work hard? Coming in on Sunday? That'll make up for the month off, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope the coin toss goes well. You know? I hope it goes well, the coin toss. . You know how easily Bush can be distracted by bright, shiny objects.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I don't think that's a big deal for him. Tossing a coin in the Oval Office? That's how he makes most of the decisions, isn't it, pretty much? 'Yeah, give me the coin. All right, tax cut. Why not?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's interesting -- I -- we joke about this, and I think most people are familiar with President Bush's intellect by this point. And now, his brother Jeb has come out and said these recent shark attacks in Florida aren't that bad. They're not that bad. Here's my question. How dumb is Neil Bush? You know the brother they hide from the public, the one we never hear speak?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And at the first official state dinner at the White House the other night, the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, said he wants to tear down the fence between the US and Mexico. Fence? What fence? When'd they put that up, Saturday? Right? Can you see anybody climbing a fence? Not me. I don't know any kind of fence. What fence is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know who was also at the White House dinner? Clint Eastwood was at the White House dinner. . In fact, people didn't even recognize him. You know, they thought it was Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody know what party Clint Eastwood belongs to? I don't know. What was he when he was mayor? Anybody know? Well, it's hard to figure what he is 'cause in 'Dirty Harry' -- remember, he was tough on crime, so he could have been a Republican. But then in 'Bridges of Madison County,' he had sex with that guy's wife, so he could have been a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big economic news released today -- for the first time, our country has 150 million people who are considered middle-class. The bad news -- last week, they were considered wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is interesting -- this Sunday, the NFL season's going to begin with a coin toss from President Bush in the Oval Office. True story. That's what they're gonna do. And coincidentally, it's the same coin that was used to decide the presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of politics -- yesterday, Hillary Clinton criticized a neighbor in Chappaqua because the neighbor's son threw a party for his high school football team and hired a stripper to put on a nude sex show. But Hillary Clinton's mad. Mrs. Clinton, very mad. Yeah, and President Clinton criticized the parents, too, but only 'cause he wasn't invited. He was mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Friday, September 7, and you know what that means? It's the beginning of another 30-day weekend for President Bush. Give him a little time to unwind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a big state dinner at the White House for the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, they had a big state dinner for him. And it was exciting. I guess the highlight was when Dick Cheney -- Vice President, you know, with the heart thing -- passed out in the guacamole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a crazy night. About 1:00 they had to run over to Ted Kennedy's house for more margarita salt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Janet Reno is running. She wants to be governor, running for governor of the state of Florida. And she's very popular down there. A lot of folks remember her when she played for the Dolphins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit is back in Washington looking tanned, rested, and creepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condit's father -- everybody has to get their two cents in on this -- Condit's father was interviewed some place and he's blaming, blaming all of his sons' problems and difficulties on Satan. Now, here's the weird part. Now Satan is missing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has called an emergency economic summit to deal with this recession. Bush said he's very worried about job loss. Yeah, his own.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he will move to ask Congress to legalize aliens. So finally, some good news for Anne Heche, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Attorney General Janet Reno has announced she will run for Governor of Florida. Gov. Jeb Bush said, 'Don't throw those voting machines out just yet, okay? We might need 'em one more time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Gary Condit now hinting he may want to retire. Gee, things were going so well. . He didn't mention why he is thinking about stepping down. I think we can rule out that he wants to spend more time with his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George W. Bush met with Australian Prime Minister John Howard today in an attempt to strengthen the relationship between the two nations. This is Bush's first meeting with a national leader since he saw Dick Cheney in the hall this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush later apologized to the Prime Minister for not visiting Australia during his recent trip to Europe and for momentarily ignoring Howard when he arrived because he was expecting Jeff Probst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American explorers in Mongolia believe that they may have discovered the tomb of legendary tough-guy Genghis Khan. . Historians are not sure where Genghis Khan is buried, but they would like to re-interview Congressman Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 34 years, Mr. Rogers has aired his final show. The good news is the President can still watch Sesame Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I especially like the part where he said, even though we're in difficult times, he wants tolerance for people of all religions. And then, right after that, Jerry Falwell got up, gave the two-minute rebuttal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the speech was so good, last night in Philadelphia.during the Flyers hockey game, they stopped play to watch the President's speech. . And today, the Washington Redskins fans demanded they rebroadcast the speech on Sunday so they can cancel that game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Americans are becoming more and more acquainted with this Osama bin Laden guy. Been readin' about this guy? Spoiled rich kid -- 300 million bucks. He's got $300 million. Three words for this guy -- Anna Nicole Smith. . We send her over there, she'll get his money, he'll be dead in a week. Boom, there you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And America seems to be adjusting. In fact, here in Hollywood, people are almost back to abnormal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's officially Autumn. . In many parts of the country, leaves are starting to turn brown and fall to the ground. And today, Jerry Falwell blamed it on gays and lesbians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osama bin Laden &quot;inherited $80 million at age thirteen, and has since expanded it to $300 million through construction projects, smart investments, and gas and oil investments. See, this way he can use the money in his war against capitalism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan, the Taliban said they asked bin Laden to leave the country voluntarily. . They asked him to leave voluntarily? Like if that doesn't work, what do they do next, maybe a couple of fake yawns?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leaders of the Taliban said today that killing bin Laden won't solve the problem. But, you know, it couldn't hurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see who has been appointed as one of the top people on the new congressional committee on homeland security? Gary Condit. Well, that makes sense. The CIA said that if we're going to investigate the scum of the earth, we're going to need lowlifes and degenerates to go in there for it, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton is in the news. Clinton said he will fly commercial flights at least four times this week to demonstrate that flying is safe. In fact, the only thing you have to be afraid of on a plane now - sitting next to Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Elizabeth Dole announced that she is gonna run for Senate in North Carolina. . She's gonna make a run. Yeah, and when asked about it, Bob Dole said, 'I am so excited, I don't even need one of my blue pills.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the beginning of the&quot; Miss America pageant, &quot;all 50 came out dressed as something from their home state, something indigenous to their home state. And Miss Florida came out -- it was great -- dressed as a cooked voting machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something pretty amazing. According to the latest polls, President George W. Bush has the highest approval rating of any President ever. Isn't that amazing? In fact, even people in Palm Beach are now claiming, 'No, I voted for him, really. It just looked like Buchanan.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's now being reported that Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta wants all airports to install these face recognition machines. You know what these are? Electronic scanners. They can instantly identify you by your face or any part of your face. Good luck getting that to work in LA, huh? These people here get a new face what, every six, eight weeks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in an effort to get people back in air travel, put a little faith back in the air travel system, former President Bill Clinton announced this week he will fly commercial airlines four times. Four times this week. Of course, this is Clinton, you don't know if he's being patriotic, or he just likes being patted down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes our country is so politically correct. I'm watching our local news, and they said, 'America continues to search for alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.' Alleged? We already said we want him dead or alive. Do we have to keep saying alleged? Apparently, it's okay if we kill him. God forbid, he sues us for libel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more facts, more and more facts coming out about bin Laden. You know he never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row? Just like Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;60 Minutes had a wonderful piece on it this past Sunday. They always do a good job. These clerics, they tell these kids, if they kill themselves, they'll go straight to paradise, and they'll be surrounded by beautiful virgins, and they'll eat fresh dates for the rest of their lives. Now, if I was one of these guys, my first question would be, 'If this is so great, why don't you go?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congressman Gary Condit, remember him? This guy couldn't get arrested, now, if he was bitten by a shark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been named to the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Security. Well, you saw how tight-lipped he was with Connie Chung and the cops. You don't have to worry about him talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in New York, we had the primary elections for mayor. Did you know that? We had the primary elections today, which shows that things are moving forward. I thought that was good. Yeah, and apparently, to improve their chances, all five of the candidates changed their name to Rudy Giuliani.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was primary election day here in New York City. And people from all over the country are helping out. Florida -- for example, the state of Florida...they donated 1,000 crooked voting machines.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's popularity, 90%, the highest of any president ever. In fact, they said -- listen to this. Listen to this. They said if President Bush ran for president today, he could actually be elected.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Arabia has become the latest nation to join our side and cut off diplomatic relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yeah, good for them. Good for them. There are reports on the news, tonight, that members of the Taliban feel persecuted and now fear for their own safety. So now they know what it's like to be a woman in their country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reuters news service has told the reporters not to use the word 'terrorist.' Because in the mind of a terrorist, he's a freedom fighter, so you shouldn't call them terrorists. Oh, shut up. You know, in the mind of a shark, I'm not a person, I'm lunch. But it's still a shark, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read in the paper today, this bin Laden guy, the wealthiest man in Afghanistan. See, that's when you know your government is no good, when the richest guy in the country lives in a cave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush is continuing to urge Americans to resume their usual spending habits. And a related story, MC Hammer went broke again today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more and more religious leaders in this country are speaking out. Today, Jerry Falwell called the Taliban the greatest threat to Western civilization since the Teletubbies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, Jesse Jackson was on CNN talking about --- Jesse's talkin' about going to Afghanistan. You know, I'm surprised he hasn't been involved sooner. I mean, the words 'Afghanistan' and 'Taliban' already rhyme. Half his work is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Yorkers are still pulling together and displaying their patriotism, which is very cool. And I'll give you -- it's true. It's true, yeah. Yeah, yesterday, for example -- yesterday, when a cabbie gave me the finger, there was an American flag attached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To improve traffic problems, Mayor Giuliani announced that cars will not be allowed to drive in most of Manhattan, unless they have at least two passengers. That's the new rule here. You know, which is gonna be tough, 'cause now President Clinton has to ride to work with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we begin, I have one announcement to make. I am available for a third term.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is an important event in the history of television. 39 years ago today, talk about how time gets away from you, the Beverly Hillbillies debuted on CBS. 39 years...that's right, and then in 1992 they moved into the White House for eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Bush's approval rating is so high, today he fired the Supreme Court. 'I don't need you guys anymore. I'm on my own.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban has asked Osama bin Laden to voluntarily leave the country. They said they delivered a note to him asking him to leave, which is a pretty good trick considering they claim they don't even know where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A former member of bin Laden's group told ABC News, 'Bin Laden is prepared to die.' Which works out great 'cause we're prepared to help him. Hey, we found common ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan yesterday, they stormed the abandoned US embassy -- this thing has been abandoned since 1988 -- and burned a number of American flags. Where did they get all of these American flags in Afghanistan, you know? I can't get an American flag here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And who is buying the flags? How'd you like to be the guy ordering the flags in Afghanistan? How does that work? Does anybody here have an Afghanistan flag? No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government says they're now going to go after the terrorists' electronic banking system. You know what they should do? They should transfer bin Laden's funds to my bank. They'd mess up his deposits, screw up his statements and nickel and dime him to death with service charges, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a rumor that Jesse Jackson was going to go over there to talk with the Taliban. Apparently, they were having trouble rhyming the word 'jihad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Jesse said today he is not going. He's not going. Actually, what he said was, 'I have no plan to go to Afghanistan or Pakistan to talk to the Taliban.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Afghanistan is the world's leading producer of opium, which is the vital ingredient in heroin. And of course, opium is very important in religious beliefs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here at home, Congressman Gary Condit -- and what better choice? Has been named to the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Security. In fact, this week he gave himself a background check, he said he passed with flying colors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Bush announced a plan to put Air Marshals on every plane, which I think is a good idea. But that's a tough job. Imagine going to work every day, you know the lunch is going to suck. You're going to see the same crappy movie for a month. And every day they lose your luggage. What is that like?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton said he is flying commercial flights four times this week to show America that it's safe. Clinton's flying commercial four times in one week? Sounds like somebody's got a crush on a flight attendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, folks, I don't know, I must have missed something. I thought I had the news on. Did Jesse Jackson get elected to something today? Did I miss -- is he the new Secretary of State? Did I miss something? Jesse says, now, it is not likely he will visit Afghanistan. But then he says, 'don't tell my wife, she thinks I'm going.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Jesse changed his mind when he found out the Taliban doesn't allow TV cameras. 'That's it. I'm out of here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the Taliban turned down a second request to turn over Osama bin Laden. It looks like the Taliban's about to learn an old American tradition -- three strikes, you're out. Isn't that what it is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching this one spokesman for the Taliban, I think it was on CNN, this blind sheik, and he says he has no idea where Osama bin Laden is. Well, duh, he's a blind sheik, okay? Why don't we ask the deaf guy if he's heard something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a story that kinda bothers me. And I'm not a big jingoistic guy, here, but this -- Reuters News Service and CNN are telling their reporters they can no longer refer to bin Laden and his people as terrorists because, in their minds, they are freedom fighters. They have to use the term 'alleged hijacker.' This is according to a spokesman -- an alleged idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are freedom [fighters] -- explain this to me. If you live there, men have to have a beard, you can't laugh in public, there's no TV, there's no radio, women have no rights. What freedom is he fighting for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani lobbying, now, to stay in office an extra three months. And today, Clinton said, 'you can do that? . I can't believe -- why didn't I know that? You can lobby to stay on the job?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported.that President Bush is really upset with former President Clinton because this week,&quot; he &quot;made a high-profile appearance on NBC's 'Nightly News.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Al Gore carries a picture in his wallet from his and Bush's debates. He pulls it out and goes, 'Look, I know him. Yeah, we used to hang out.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, in a speech in Iowa over the weekend, Al Gore called for unity with President Bush. Have you seen Al Gore lately?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, as part of his political comeback, he spent the weekend driving around Iowa in a brown Ford Taurus, by himself, staying at Holiday Inn Express.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on in Washington. Boy, security, they have tough new security measures in DC, and, of course, they should, but police now arrest suspicious loiters. If they see you standing around doing nothing, they arrest you. In fact, Sunday, picked up the Washington Redskins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see those three Taliban leaders on the news announcing they have Osama bin Laden under control? All three of these guys have beards, one of them's got a patch over his eye, the one is missing a hand, the other one has a wooden leg. Maybe I'm wrong, didn't these guys used to work at Pirates of the Caribbean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest word is that right now, as we're talking, there is a sneak attack being staged against bin Laden. Rebel troops are massing in the north, and US and British special forces are collecting intelligence on his location, and bin Laden knows nothing about this. Unless, of course, he turns on CNN.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Bill Clinton was disbarred from practicing law by the Supreme Court today. That's it. You see that? He lost his law license. Yeah, how about that? Just another hard-working Harlem brother being kept down by the man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They revoked his law license, yet he's still allowed to keep that marriage license. How did that work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Gates continues to be the richest man the world. The second- richest, the guy over here on Ventura Boulevard selling flags.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest issue of Forbes magazine, Bill Gates -- how much do you think he's worth? $54 billion. Now, think about it. He's worth $54 billion, the net worth of Afghanistan is $11 billion. Let's get Gates to buy it, turn it into rental property and evict bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crises always seem to bring you get the geniuses and the morons. It seems this Kansas state Senator, Republican Kay O'Connor, said over the weekend. She said if a woman's rights to vote were being considered today, she'd vote against it, because she thinks men should take care of women. She said, 'If men were protecting women, they could stay home and raise their families and not have to go out and bother to vote.' Today, the Taliban her voted woman of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Post reporting that Gary Condit.you remember Congressman Gary Condit. He has told friends he will probably run for reelection. Isn't that amazing? Condit still has friends?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't hear much about him anymore. You know, he could have an affair and get bitten on the ass by a shark, he couldn't get in the newspaper now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani addressed the UN, and his speech was translated into over 100 different languages. Isn't that cool? I thought that was really nice. Yeah, unfortunately -- unfortunately, there is no translation for the word 'fuggetaboutit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the recent scheduling changes that we've all experienced in this country, the NFL announced that this year's Super Bowl may end up being played right here in New York. . Yeah, the Mayor, Mayor Giuliani, says he hopes we do get the Super Bowl because he's trying to get New York's scalpers back on their feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bad news for Bill Clinton. He is disbarred, that's right, so now the only time he can argue a case is in front his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even former political rivals like Bill Clinton and Bob Dole are working together to help New York. They said they want to show people that they could put their differences aside for a common goal. And those two really are different when you think about it. I mean, there's Bob Dole, who always talks in the third person, and Bill Clinton who always denies there's a third person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton and Dole are joining forces to raise $100 million in scholarship money for the families of the victims. And it's a great thing they're doing. But you know who deserves a pat on the back? Elizabeth Dole. I mean imagine, her husband's on Viagra, he's going on the road with Bill Clinton, that is one trusting woman, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has asked everyone to start flying again. Well, everyone except Jesse Jackson. They're trying to keep Jesse here, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the Washington Redskins said they're not afraid to fly. They're afraid to run, pass, punt and play defense, but they're not afraid to fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush's popularity still way, way up there. Give you an idea on how popular Bush has become, listen to this. Today, he was telling Dick Cheney what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien -- that's very nice -- He said Canada would lend the US its full military support. You know what that means -- both tanks. Yeah, we get both tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador for the US said that bin Laden had an unhappy childhood growing up. . Do you think his childhood was unhappy? Wait until we deliver his mid-life crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, today, the Taliban leaders say that bin Laden is starting to worry about his own safety now. In fact, he's already moved into a cave in a gated community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You read about all these terrorists that have entered the US, you know, most of them came here legally. And I'm not picking on -- I'm not saying Arabs or anything like that. I mean terrorists, people who are terrorists. They came here legally. But they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10 or 15 years. Now compare that to Blockbuster. You're two days late with a video -- you know, these people are all over you. Let's put Blockbuster in charge of immigration, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a programming note. Tomorrow night on NBC, a very special episode of West Wing. It's not the premiere episode, but it's a special episode of West Wing that makes a direct reference, of course, to what happened in New York City. And they said, today, the exact plot is being kept top secret. You know what's amazing? We are the only country in the world where we put our battle plans on CNN, but the plots to our TV shows are top secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Osama bin Laden has 50 brothers and sisters. 50 brothers and sisters. Yeah, which absolutely shocked me 'cause I had no idea he was Catholic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking about something today. And if you know anything about me at all, you know I'm no political genius. I don't know how stuff happens. But I was thinking to myself today, you know what this country needs right now? A good old fashioned Bill Clinton sex scandal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talking about Bill Clinton, yesterday, the Supreme Court disbarred him, you know? But he's not worried about that because he's just going to pardon himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have read about this in the paper. Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are teaming up for a new scholarship called the Dole/Clinton scholarship. It will be given to a grad student who overcomes his impotence enough to go out and successfully commit adultery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton gradually getting more and more in the media. Normally, he's so shy. Usually, he likes to stay in the back.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton is urging his fellow New Yorkers -- he's a brother. He lives in Harlem now. . Bill Clinton is urging his fellow New Yorkers to ease the traffic problem by using public transportation. That's what he said today. He said the subway is fast and efficient, and, as Clinton put it, 'During rush hour, you can accidentally brush up against women and get away with it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, poor Al Gore. Did you see him on the news this week? Al, lose the beard. Not a good time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Al Gore spent the last weekend in Iowa, driving around in a brown Ford Taurus all by himself, visiting people and staying in different hotels every night. You know the whole time, he did not sell one single encyclopedia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a 5.0 earthquake in Afghanistan this week. So good news, God apparently has joined the coalition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taliban ruler Mullah Omar said Americans are too cowardly to attack Afghanistan. Then he went back in his cave and hid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These Taliban leaders, everyone of them smokes. They all smoke. That's got to be very strange. One of them says they're going out for a camel, you don't know if he means a cigarette or sex.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, Americans are still trying to understand this whole Taliban thing. It's very confusing. They don't allow television, they don't allow music, they don't allow dancing. You know who we should send over there? Kevin Bacon. He could do that whole 'Footloose' thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something else I don't understand about these terrorists. They tell their followers if they lay down their life for their cause, they will go to heaven and be surrounded by virgins. Does that sound like heaven, being surrounded by a bunch of women who don't know what the hell they're doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what Osama bin Laden's going to be for Halloween? A dead guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very, very tight security on tonight's episode of West Wing, on the set of West Wing. They had very tight security on the set today of West Wing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is it with all these preachers lately? You got Jesse Jackson trying to be secretary of state, you got Jerry Falwell coming out against gays, you got Pat Robertson blaming our troubles on dirty pictures on the Internet. What happened to the good, old days? Remember when we had respect for religious leaders? Men like Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This just in, Congressman Gary Condit has put his Washington, DC condo up for sale for $130,000. Two story condo. His story, and then the one he told to police.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MSNBC reporting that a film production company now talking to Bill Clinton about appearing as himself in a movie. They've offered Clinton a role in a movie. The film is called 'Dude, Where Are My Pants?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton and Bob Dole are traveling the country together. That's an interesting combination, isn't it? Clinton and Bob Dole? And...they have nothing really in common. I mean...in Dole's case, it's only his arteries that are hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shirley Maclain.suggested on her website a strategy to defeat the terrorists and defeat the Taliban. This is what she wants. This is true.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Giuliani urging everyone in New York to go see a play, which is a great idea. He's urging everyone to come to New York and see a play.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush's approval rating now at 99.999%. If they could just get Barbra Streisand and Al Gore to lighten up, they'd push it over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, support for this coalition is growing. In fact, today, Mike Tyson was criticizing how the Taliban treats women. . Even Ike Turner said, 'they gotta go.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it's good to see everybody doing their part, even in Beverly Hills -- listen to this. Guys in Beverly Hills have even stopped wearing the afghan sweaters tied around the neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what I love about our country. 'Cause all aspects of our country get involved no matter what you do. This is true. The 'National Enquirer' has sent a reporter to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. This is true. They got a reporter who snuck across the border, and he's finding out their secrets. Isn't that amazing? You know, Bush said he was going to unleash our greatest spies, I just assumed it was the CIA. I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And thanks to all the coverage, Americans are finally starting to see just how oppressive this Taliban regime can be. You know, in Afghanistan, there's no dancing. There's no singing. There's no music. It's like the movie 'Glitter.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something bizarre. Listen to this. . There are reports that the Taliban uses sheep as mine detectors. Do you know how those work? This is what they do. They send the sheep out, if it hits the mine and blows up, then the Taliban leaders have dinner. . And if the sheep misses the mine, then they have a date. You see, it works out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you see them on TV, you know all these Taliban leaders, they all smoke. They all smoke and the ones who don't smoke, they should be smoking pretty soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, both the covers of 'Time' and 'Newsweek' were about biological attacks. You see that? 'Time' and 'Newsweek' have people in gas masks and all this. I mean, that doesn't look very likely. But the US government says the medical community is ready for a quick response, God forbid, in case that did happen. Unless, of course, you have an HMO. Then you have to first contact your primary doctor, who will refer you to a specialist, who will tell you to hold your breath for six to eight weeks until you can get an appointment. Other than that, you'll be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you ever seen this Osama bin Laden guy? Do you know how tall he is? . He is 6'5.&quot; He's a big guy. 6'5.&quot; That's got to be tough being that tall, living in a cave. Banging your head all day. In fact, it's not even a turban he wears, it's gauze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government is -- the government continues to encourage people to stimulate the economy. It's important for you to do that. You go out and you spend money, you go to New York, you see a show, have a slice of pizza, whatever you want to do. In fact, even the hookers on Hollywood Boulevard have a stimulus package. For 50 bucks they'll stimulate your package. I think that's a fine -- good for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. Bill Clinton revealed this week, that while he was president, he kept a diary on tape, every day he would talk into a tape recorder. He has over 80 tapes, and now they're gonna sell them. I believe it's $4.99 for the first minute and $2.99 each additional minute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Congressman Gary Condit. Remember him, he used to be important in the news? He's now selling his condo in Washington. He says the place is like new. In fact, he only used the microwave oven once, and that was just to give himself a lie detector test, which he passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here you go, I don't know if you heard the latest intelligence findings. This in from the CIA. Just got this today. Ross got Rachel pregnant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I phrase this? A new female birth control device has been approved this week by the FDA. It's a ring that's left in place for three weeks at a time. Do you think that will work? I mean, most people in town can't keep a ring on their finger for three weeks at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has turned down the case of a man who says he can only have sex twice a month now because of a forklift accident. He can only have sex twice a month because of an accident with a forklift. Here's my question. How big was that woman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know the Taliban and Columbus have something in common? Did you know that? Because on this day they both really discovered America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you know by now, the Taliban is now the 'Taliboom' if you've been watching television.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess yesterday, the US flew the B-1 bombers, the Stealth bombers, the big Hornets, the Tomcats, all these fighter jets in Afghanistan. So I guess we showed them Americans are not afraid to fly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though we attacked, our military is now air dropping tons of foods to the civilians of Afghanistan. In fact, they said in the news there hasn't been this much food thrown out of a plane since Continental Airlines introduced their chicken a la king.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not only dropping food and medicine for the civilians, we're also dropping thousands of little transistor radios. Which is kind of embarrassing. It turns out the radios are from Radio Shack and now the Afghans are trying to return them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sources say bin Laden has as many as four look-alike doubles, right now, to create confusion as to his actual whereabouts. Boy, you thought you hated your job, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the National Enquirer, bin Laden, who's supposed to be so religious, apparently has had an affair with a married woman. So not only is a terrorist, he's also a cave wrecker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man was subdued by passengers on an American Airline flight from LA to Chicago when this guy tried to get into the cockpit. Luckily, nobody was hurt, ended okay, nobody was injured. And it was not terrorist related. So the good news is, turns out it wasn't one of their crazies, it was one of our crazies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said he was described as a deranged man. See, that shows our security's working. See, terrorists cannot get through, but deranged people, that's okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, boy, President Clinton in hot water again. Oh, boy. Did you hear about this? He got home a little late last night, and when Hillary asked, 'Where were you?' He said, 'Oh, I was at the Emmies. It was a great show, I couldn't believe it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cal Ripken played his final game the other night. Did you see who was at the game? Bill Clinton was there. Bill Clinton was there right behind home plate sitting right behind the catcher. That's got to bring back some memories, huh? Seeing a 250-pounder wearing knee pads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today on 'Martha Stewart Living,' Martha visited a factory that makes US flags. Isn't that interesting? She did that, yeah. And apparently, Martha got a little carried away at the factory, because the US flag's new colors are goldenrod, mauve and eggshell. It's pretty. They're nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to ABC News, one of the most popular Halloween masks this year -- and boy is this the sign of the times. One of the most popular Halloween masks this year is the Mayor Giuliani mask. That's true. That's right. It's really popular. Yeah, not only that, all the children who wear the Giuliani mask want to extend Halloween by three months.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know when you came in tonight, we have increased security here at NBC. I'm sorry if it was a delay for anybody, 'cause we got the metal detectors -- you know, I don't even mind the increased security. I think it's good. Just the part where the guard makes me turn my head and cough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush very angry at members of Congress today, and rightfully so, for leaking classified military secrets to the press. Boy, we have a strange country, isn't it? Military secrets all over the TV, the only information we can't find out -- who won an Emmy?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden released a statement today. He said 'Argh!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do the Washington Redskins and the Taliban have in common? Neither one will be around for the playoffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know, the other day bin Laden made a rare TV appearance on videotape in which he called America sinners, and said we are responsible for what happened to us. Boy, where's he been? Jerry Falwell said that a month ago. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden also said he seeks refuge in God. Well, hey, we're doing the best we can to arrange a meeting. We're trying to set it up. Let's get them together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell this bin Laden guy is a real hypocrite. Like he said, he announced, if he dies in the attack, he wants a traditional Muslim burial, but if he's only wounded, he wants a Jewish doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden's brother gave an interview to the Boston Globe newspaper, and he said that Osama was the black sheep of the family. Gee, I hope so, I would hate to think he's the nice one, you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, bin Laden's brother is a lawyer, he's an attorney. So apparently, terrorism runs in the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we speak, US and British forces are dropping 37,000 food packets on Afghanistan. Actually, the US food is for the Afghan people, the British food is for the Taliban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is asking people to return to their normal activities. Just do what you normally do. And today, Anne Heche announced she is a lesbian again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man described as crazy and deranged tried to get into the cockpit of an American Airlines plane bound from LA to Chicago. The guy actually got into the cockpit. Here's my question, okay? How come the restroom doors on the plane are locked, but the cockpit doesn't lock?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On her TV show this week, Martha Stewart showed the proper way to display an American flag. A lot of people don't know how to do it. She does it the proper way. And she says she is 100% anti-Taliban. As far as she's concerned, the only person who has the right to tell women how to lead their lives is Martha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Daily News, Bill Clinton should not have any problems writing his memoirs, because from day one of his presidency, he started recording his impressions on audiotape. He made audiotapes. That's nothing. You should see what he's got on videotapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single day, I continue to be shocked at how nice people are being to each other in New York right now. Have you noticed this? It's sweet. People are being nice. A whole new side. People are really behaving much better. Yeah, in fact, this afternoon, when I bought a hot dog from a vendor, he told me, 'You know, I wouldn't eat this crap, if I were you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continues to say we should go on and live our lives normally. He said that, live your life normally. So today I took him up on it and sat in the house all day in my underwear watching Ricky Lake. Things are back to normal for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security now, if you have been traveling around New York City, security is extra tight. Listen to this, I'm walking through Central Park today on my lunch hour. This is how tight security is -- I saw a squirrel X-raying his nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they say New Yorkers now are coping by having lots and lots of sex. I know that's how I'm coping, and it's costing me a bundle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's start off with some sports news. I read this today. Looks like Afghanistan's the first country in the world to have a 10,000 hole golf course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the Taliban leaders like to do for fun? Oh, just sit around and get bombed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the National Enquirer, and, of course, you know they check and then check the facts again. Osama bin Laden once had an affair with a married woman. You know, we should put Clinton in charge of tracking this guy down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is urging people to get back to work. And today he urged the Washington Redskins to find a new line of work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US planes continue to drop humanitarian aid on Afghanistan. They're dropping thousands of these individual meal packets from a height of 30,000 feet. They're dropping them from 30,000 feet. Boy, you thought the Chips Ahoy! cookies in your bag were broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said in the last few days we've dropped 100,000 boxes of food on Afghanistan. I was thinking about that. You know what we should have done? We should have dropped boxes of Total cereal. Because one bowl of Total would be equal to like 15 bowls of regular cereal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, rightfully so, has scolded members of Congress for leaking secret military information. This is so stupid, these guys. They talked to the press about this. . You know what we should do? We should find which members of Congress leaked the classified information, give them the classifieds and tell them to start looking for a new job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is now a $5 million bounty on Osama bin Laden's head. Which marks the first time in history there's ever been a bounty on a guy's head, who wears Bounty on his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Entertainment Weekly, the Pentagon has contacted Hollywood screenwriters and other people in Hollywood to try to get ideas from them. You know, talking to people who wrote like Die Hard and some of these movies. Actually, the Army got one good tip. Interesting. Apparently, the producers of 'Glitter' showed them how to evacuate a building very quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're trying to scare us with this, showing this bin Laden guy on TV and all the talk about anthrax. See, we shouldn't live our lives -- we shouldn't be paranoid. You know, I was talking about this today with my food taster. You know it's silly -- you know what I mean? It's silly to even worry about this kind of thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, they were talking, not to alarm anybody, but one fear is that the terrorists will put something in our water supply. Did you hear this? Hey, let me tell you something. The arsenic in our water will kill just about anything, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a lighter note, according to this week's US News &amp; World Report, President Clinton was out on the golf course, scored a hole in one without cheating. That's what it said. I just like that, the magazine has to tell you that Clinton scored the hole in one without cheating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to put that, without cheating. I think it's the first time the words Clinton and 'without cheating' have appeared in the same sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty good, though, huh? A hole in one. That's something, isn't it? So apparently since leaving office, Clinton's aim has really improved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences now is thinking about holding the Emmy Awards at a military base. Remember, they were canceled last Sunday. Now they're thinking of holding them at a military base. Aren't we at war? I mean, doesn't the Academy realize the military might be busy right now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government has been trying to open up a line of communication with the Afghani people by dropping thousands of tiny radios all over their country. Isn't that fascinating? We're, like, dropping radios. Yeah, and the plan must be working, 'cause, earlier today, four Afghanis won tickets to a Limp Bizkit concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Friday, America's 52 million students will be asked to simultaneously recite the Pledge of Allegiance. So it's pretty cool, yeah. Yeah, and if the kids can't remember that, they're gonna have them recite the theme song to 'Friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you folks seen the creepy picture of Osama bin Laden in the newspaper wearing his Timex wrist watch? Why would this guy possibly need a watch? He lives in a cave. What the hell does he need a watch for? He lives in a cave. It's either night or day. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be interesting to see how that watch is working after a couple of cruise missiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite all the extra security going on in the country, Attorney General John Ashcroft went to the Navy-Air Force football game this week. He went to the game, sat in the crowd with all the people, and he told the people, he does not think Americans should avoid sporting events. Unless, of course, you are a Redskins fan.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the allied forces have hit all the Taliban military installations and bases.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this bin Laden guy is creepy, isn't he? Remember the old days, when the only millionaire living in a cave was Batman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bob Woodward of the Washington Post reported today that bin Laden has given the Taliban $100 million in cash. That's what he said. He has more or less bought the country. He has literally bought the country. And I love what he has done with the place. He's not only a terrorist, he's a slum lord too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And everybody is talking about finding bin Laden. Hey, how about finding Dick Cheney? Where'd he go? What happened to him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What, do we got caves over here now, too? Where'd he go? I think his Secret Service code name is Waldo. Where is he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how we're going to resolve this situation. You know what it is? Our cultures are so different. Like over there, for example, over there, if a couple commits adultery, they get stoned. Here, it's the exact opposite. Here we get stoned and then commit adultery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably heard this. You probably heard the rumor that a former intern, an intern in Florida was spreading the anthrax. It was not an intern. Turns out, that was just a rumor started by Hillary to scare Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the rock band Anthrax now, very upset. They're very upset. They say all this anthrax stuff is bad publicity for them. Really? This is the only publicity this band has had in five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gee, you know, who could have foreseen that naming your band after a deadly virus might turn out to be a bad thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it is now being proposed that the Emmy awards be held at a military base. That's what they're talking about doing. They said they want to use the ceremony to entertain the troops. When was the last time the Emmys were entertaining?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new book just published this week by a respected German historian, it's not some flaky guy. A respected German historian now claims that Adolph Hitler was secretly gay. Of course, Jerry Falwell is thrilled. Now he can blame World War II on gay people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Survivor debuts tonight. Does anybody care about this? How many would rather watch Osama get voted off the planet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Manhattan landlord is suing one of his tenants for $10 million, because the guy called him 'Osama.' So he's suing. Yeah, and the odd part is, the landlord's real name is Adolf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban reports -- this is the latest report. They report that Osama bin Laden is hiding -- this is what they said -- where no man can find him. Yeah, yeah. In a related story, NBC announced today that bin Laden has joined the cast of 'Emeril.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this anthrax thing is scary, isn't it? Ooh, boy. But I think it's isolated, I don't know. People panicking. And they say there are different strains. Like, there's the natural strain you can get from petting cows, which is more bad news for President Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I saw a thing on the news last night about some of these weapons that the Pentagon has. They're using these 5,000-pound bunker busters, that's what they're called. They're bombs that burrow 20 feet underground before they explode. Bunker busters. Doesn't that sound like something Suzanne Summers would be selling on an info- mercial?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the government released that list of the 22 most wanted terrorists. They say their pictures will be posted at the post office. Post them at the airport. You know? I mean, I'm no expert in terrorism, but if they're in line with me at the post office -- okay. Airport -- I'm gettin' the hell outta there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you see these guys on the list? Not the best lookin' guys in the world. Explains why they have to die to meet women, that's the only way they're gonna meet virgins, these guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm watching one of these spokesmen for the Taliban, and he said that they have thousands of young men who look forward to death like Americans look forward to living. Which is great, because we can arrange that. We'll set them up with death, we'll continue living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you something, you know, we are really the good guys here. This is really black and white, 'cause life under that Taliban is horrible. The women over there, they have to wear those veils, they can't speak, they can't have jobs, they're not allowed outside. I'll tell you something, you know that play 'The Vagina Monologues'? That is not going to do well when it opens there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the FBI now says that water supplies could be considered a logical target for terrorist attacks. And this has people in Beverly Hills very upset. Yeah, 'cause if terrorists put something in the water, this could damage the finish on the Mercedes when the chauffeur goes to wash it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, see, President Bush this week scolded congress for leaking top- secret information to the press. And rightly so. You know, it seems the only time congressmen can keep a secret anymore is when it involves mistresses or bribes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is kind of nice. 26 years ago yesterday, Bill and Hillary Clinton were first married. And 26 years ago today, Bill cheated on her for the very first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the National Center for Health Statistics, the average life-expectancy in the United States -- 76.9 years. That's the highest it's ever been. In fact, that's pretty good compared to other countries. For example, if you're in the Taliban, well, your time is up in about 20 minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the AP news service, the Taliban has reportedly -- this just came in -- reportedly banned people in Afghanistan from speaking English. It is now against the law to speak English in that country. Yeah, so as a result the most popular movie star in Afghanistan is now Sylvester Stallone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can feel it, you can tell, little by little each day, New York City is really getting back to normal. And I'll tell you what, wait a minute. Today...for example, today, Mayor Giuliani said it was okay to give each other the finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you something. Security here in New York City is still very, very intense, very tight. Hookers in Times Square now are demanding two forms of fake ID.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news for young people here tonight. This is kind of fun. A lot of terrific job openings here at NBC. Bad news is, you have to start in the mail room and work your way up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember the good old days when you were afraid to open the mail because it might be a chain letter?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know, the FBI has been releasing information on how to spot a suspicious package. Like, for example, if a suspicious man offers you a package to hold, well, you're in danger. But, if a suspicious man offers to hold your package, you're in Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's really scary about anthrax? The name anthrax, it sounds like Amtrak, which is even scarier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI says our water supply could be a target now for terrorist attacks. The easy way to avoid contaminated water, especially here in California: if the little seal on your Evian bottle is broken, don't drink it. Okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, we attacked the Taliban military academy. Attacked that thing. This is a very exclusive school, this Taliban academy. You know the tuition? Four goats a year.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Pakistan, anti-American protesters burned down what they thought was a symbol of the US. They burned down a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They burned down a KFC restaurant, they burned it to the ground in Pakistan. 'Cause, you know, they probably thought it was a good idea at the time. 'We'll burn down Kentucky Fried Chicken.' But you know, next week, when they get hungry, and they're sitting around a burning pile of camel dung, cooking rancid goat meat, they're going to be going, 'A bucket of wings right now wouldn't be bad. Maybe we made a mistake burning down that KFC.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, we continue to drop bombs and food. We're dropping both bombs and food on the people of Afghanistan, which has got to be confusing, dropping bombs and food. I mean, how are you supposed to know which plane to stand under?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US intelligence sources now tell us that this Osama bin Laden guy -- you know how he gets his money for the terrorist organization? Mr. Religious, he gets the money by the sale of heroin and honey. That's what they sell. He sells heroin and honey. That sounds like some kind of Keith Richards breakfast cereal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the UN and Secretary General Kofi Annan. They have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create a more peaceful world. Well, there is a job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is helping to celebrate Spanish Heritage Month. Did you know this was Spanish Heritage Month? And the theme this year of Spanish Heritage Month is, 'Don't shoot, we're not from the Mideast, we're Mexican.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy anniversary, God bless them, Bill and Hillary Clinton celebrated 26 years together over the weekend. You know what's interesting? You see, marriages are like flowers, the fake ones last the longest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, we had a little scare. Guys, about a half a dozen guys.in contamination suits broke into Rupert's Hello Deli and carried out the chicken salad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all honesty, people in New York City are still a little bit nervous. The drug dealers, as a matter of fact, now they're selling Cipro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you can sure tell there's a war going on. Earlier today, up at Yankee Stadium, George Steinbrenner showed up in a camouflage turtle neck sweater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more now about Osama bin Laden. His father -- listen to this -- his father was married 16 times, and he has five wives. I think we're getting to the roots of his anger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they say bin Laden never spends the night in the same place twice. Wait a minute. That's Clinton. Forget that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to NBC, where you don't have to wait until Halloween to be scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, do you believe this? Suddenly, having your letter lost in the mail is not a bad thing anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, now I know why they keep canceling the Emmys. They can't get anybody to open those envelopes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And pretty scary in DC yesterday, Senator Tom Daschle, what did he get, anthrax spores in the mail? Remember the good old days when the only one releasing spores in Washington was Bill Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the FBI is urging all Americans to be aware of any letters or packages that have badly misspelled words. This is going to be terrible news for the rap music industry, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, 75% of the heroin and the opium in the whole world comes from Afghanistan and is marketed by the Taliban. I was thinking about this. You have these hijackers, remember, they went to strip clubs, they're looking for hookers, they gamble, they sell drugs. What would these guys be like if they were not religious fundamentalists?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides the bombs, we're also dropping food, radios and leaflets on Afghanistan. Which is kind of odd. I mean, you're sitting there in the desert, along comes an American plane, suddenly, you got breakfast, the morning paper and Howard Stern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how many of you watch Martha Stewart. God bless this woman. Did you see what she did today? . Today, she showed people, listen to this, using just an ordinary vacuum cleaner bag, some duct tape and a little basil for fragrance, how to make your very own home-made gas mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what business is booming now? You'll never guess. Dating services. These times of tension, people want to date. Dating services -- all-time high. Which makes sense, if you think about it. I mean, with anthrax, suddenly herpes doesn't seem like a bad deal anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British paper &quot;interviewed one of bin Laden's sons, and he said bin Laden has 42 children. That's going to happen when you sleep in a different cave every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, 11 members of the Washington Redskins were exposed to a mysterious white powder they'd never seen before. The end zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Queen Elizabeth is going to bestow a knighthood on Mayor Giuliani. Good for him. That's very cool. Yeah, when asked about it, Queen Elizabeth said, 'I had no choice. He wouldn't accept a lap dance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of the band Anthrax admitted that, due to recent events, their name is 'not so cool.' That's what they said. Yeah, members of the band Anthrax also admitted that their current jobs at Pizza Hut are not so cool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, scientists announced a new device that can be placed in a pacemaker. And listen to this -- it'll actually call your doctor whenever you're having heart trouble. Isn't that amazing? This little device will call your doctor. Yeah, when told about it, Dick Cheney said, 'I can't afford those kind of phone bills.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in a pretty good mood today although people in the city are still a little jumpy. Tonight I'm wearing my biohazard underwear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can sure tell it's autumn in New York. On my lunch hour today I was in Central Park and saw a squirrel storing Cipro for the winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate it when people try to capitalize on a situation. After my walk in Central Park, I'm in Starbucks and they have a new item, Ciproccino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there was another health scare in New York City yesterday up in the Bronx -- a choking incident in the Bronx. Turned out later to be the Oakland Athletics.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you know what the scariest phrase in the English language is? You got mail!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's been going on here at NBC. You know, I got a piece of mail that looked suspicious. I didn't want to touch it. I just threw it out. It sad 'jury duty' or something on it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are so worried about this anthrax in the mail thing. Remember the old days when the mail was safe and the mail carrier was dangerous?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our parent company, General Electric, boy, they're doing pretty good business these days. 'Cause everyone is buying 150-watt bulbs to hold the mail up to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, this is pretty serious. The Senate staff workers on Capitol Hill are now going to work wearing surgical masks and gloves. You know what that means? Michael Jackson was ahead of his time. He was a pioneer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the House of Representatives reached a bipartisan agreement. Both Democrats and Republicans agreed to 'get the hell out of here! Let's go!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how big this anthrax scare is in Washington, today, I saw on the news, a congressman with his hands in his own pockets. Can you imagine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody has a different worry about this anthrax thing. You know, in Florida they're worried about breathing it. In Washington, people are worried about touching it. Here in California, people want to know, 'Is it cholesterol free? Is it organic?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is when you know if you're in a good HMO. I'm in a bad one. . Like today, I wanted to get vaccinated against this anthrax. Guy wouldn't give me a shot. They gave me one of those Hart's flea and tick collars. Does that work? Does that work for anthrax?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI now said our water supply could be a target. That's the latest news. In fact, officials say, if you're in Los Angeles, and the water looks brownish and tastes metallic, it's probably okay, don't worry about it. We have so much arsenic in the water that will kill the anthrax, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commentator on the news says, 'The alleged terrorists were devout religious fundamentalists.' Here's my question, okay? When you kill thousands of people, why are they alleged terrorists but devoutly religious. Huh? Shouldn't they be allegedly religious and devout terrorists?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw a newsman hold up a picture of those 22 terrorists. He goes, 'Now this first gentleman' -- Gentleman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, and now, the airlines are asking passengers to help subdue potential hijackers. Did you see that pilot came out with an ax, he told people what to do? See the problem? There are no weapons. How are you supposed to defend yourself on a plane? What, are you going to break off one of those little liquor bottles on the beverage cart?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to fight off hijackers, but they still want to charge you four bucks for the headset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know those meals we've been dropping on Afghanistan? Well, it seems young people have been gathering them up, taking them to the city, setting up shop and selling them for huge profits. Who says the American way of life wouldn't catch on over there, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial lawyers charity association announced that lawyers all across the country have been donating blood. Isn't that nice, huh? Finally, giving back what they've been sucking out for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now some question over who is the real Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. Seems it was discovered today that thousands of votes have been counted twice. In fact, things are so screwed up, Al Gore could lose again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A recent study shows that a man in his 60s is much more likely to commit adultery than a man in his 20s. You know what this means? Bill Clinton's just getting started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York's department of health made an announcement. They said that the anthrax situation in this building has been contained, and that NBC employees are no longer at risk. Isn't that nice? I thought that was good. We need a little help. Yeah, in fact, now the only threat to NBC employees is running into Max Weinberg in the men's locker room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the Yankees and the Mariners playing in the playoffs, Mayor Giuliani has made a bet with the mayor of Seattle. 'Cause that's the traditional thing. So they've made a bet. Yeah, and here's how it works -- if the Mariners win, the Seattle mayor gets tickets to a Broadway show. And if the Yankees win, Giuliani gets to close 800 Starbucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is arranging to interview Osama bin Laden. Isn't that weird? Yeah, yeah, apparently, bin Laden says he trusts CNN, because Larry King's the only man who's had more wives than he's had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm feeling a little weird. It's my own fault. Here is what happened I mixed the Viagra with the Cipro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in New York City are still jittery. I am walking down the street and I see a doorman trying to whistle for a cab wearing a gas mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you, this anthrax thing has taken the fun out of being a hypochondriac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is going to send six questions to Osama bin Laden. They are going to try and get him to answer six questions. They published the list of questions today that they are sending Osama bin Laden. The first question, question one, listen to this: where is the strangest place you and your five wives have ever made whoopie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the whole thing to me is a waste of time. If I want it listen to a bunch of weird answers, I would invite Farrah Fawcett back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called the Post Office today. Asked if they could hold my mail for the next ten years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you know, things are really changed in Hollywood. It used to be people in town couldn't wait to get an envelope filled with white powder.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, all the networks have been affected by this NBC, ABC, today CBS. The only network that hasn't been affected is Fox. Of course, all the diseases from 'Love Cruises' and 'Temptation Island,' you know. What's a little anthrax?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched the news -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to harp on this. But it's like the networks are like a how-to manual for terrorists. You see them on the news. I see a guy -- this is an actual reporter on the news. He goes -- he's outside a water treatment plant, he's going, 'And if they poured the poison here, it could wipe out thousands, because the guard is off duty from noon until 1:00 every day!' Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. A scientific experiment was done today to determine the effect of anthrax spores, determine the effect of anthrax spores can have on chickens. But enough about Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a precautionary measure, the House of Representatives has adjourned until next Tuesday. You know, only the US Congress would tell people, 'Get back to normal. Do your life. Live as you normally do. Return to business as usual. By the way, we're getting the hell out of here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Publishers Clearing House is sending through the mail -- listen to this -- show the Publisher's Clearing House people. They're sending packets of powdered detergent that could be mistaken for anthrax. Oh, good timing here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What genius came up with this idea? What's the next promotion? A ticking alarm clock, let's put that in a box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An expert on bioterrorism testified before Congress today. He said Americans can kill anthrax by ironing their mail before you open it. They say if you steam iron your mail, that will kill the anthrax. Well, that's not going to work. Huh? Most guys would rather than iron anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know about this, the airlines are now asking passengers to help subdue potential hijackers. You know, a United Airlines pilot said today on the news, that passengers are the first line of defense. In fact, as they catch you dozing off, the flight attendant hits you with a newspaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm trying to be a good American here. But look, it's bad enough you got to bag your own groceries, you got pump your own gas, now we have to take out potential hijackers too. And here's the worse part, after you save the plane, they still got the nerve to charge you if you don't stay over at least one Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more and more news coming out about this Osama bin Laden guy. You know, he is 6'5&quot; and has 42 children. Or as the NBA calls him, a rookie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man tried unsuccessfully to hijack a greyhound bus in salt lake city. A guy tried to hijack a Greyhound bus. And in response, Greyhound announced today, from now on, all their buses will have Federally armed drifters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the Emmy awards have once again been rescheduled. Now they're on for November 4th. That's like two months now to find out who won. Two months? Who picked the winners this year, Florida voters? Let's get the Supreme Court -- let's get the Supreme Court to pick the winners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of recent events, this is interesting, half of all Americans are now using the Internet to get their news. They're gonna use the Internet now, which is an increase of more than 10%. That's a huge rise. Yeah, but don't worry, experts say before you know it we'll all be back to using the internet for its primary purpose -- downloading porn.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you may not know this, the ground war has officially started in Afghanistan. Start off on a happy note. Well, it has. Well, the big question now is, who will take power in Afghanistan once the Taliban is defeated? . I'm thinking, how about Al Gore? He's not doing anything, he needs a job, and he's already got the beard. Perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big sports news today. New world record in the 100-yard dash. It was set by 435 congressmen running away from the Capitol. 'Ahh, let's get out of here!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, cry baby Congress has shut down for a week. This is part of their big 'do as I say, not as I do' plan to get America back to work again. You know, I love these people. They tell us go back to work, go to the theater, go about your daily lives, go to restaurants, and they run home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, usually the only time congressmen leave town is when their interns' tests come back positive. That's usually the only time they leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, Congress was so empty today, the tobacco lobby had to practice giving cash to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know how many people work in Congress? . Oh, about half of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even though the House is shut down, the Senate.stayed in session. And Hillary Clinton said today, God bless her, she said, 'I will do whatever's necessary to keep me from having to spend time with my husband Bill.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, it was revealed that.handwriting analysis has been done on both the letters that contained anthrax. They said the writing on the outside of the envelope shows that whoever wrote the letters was moody and violent. Really? You think so, huh? Gee, what was the tip-off? Maybe the anthrax inside?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the Postmaster General is now mailing out instructions to everyone on how to identify and handle suspicious mail. Is that going to work? I mean, if I got a letter from the Postmaster General, that would make me suspicious, wouldn't it? 'Hey, I never met this guy. Why is he writing to me?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they say? They say if you come across suspicious mail, don't sniff it and don't taste it. Do people do that? Do they go, 'Oh, honey, taste this letter. Does this taste funny to you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the paper today, they said the CIA is now investigating whether or not other recent events were just accidents or may have been terrorism. Like the recent outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease. The spread of the Ebola virus. Oh, and remember that goose that hit Fabio in the face a couple years ago? They think that might have been terrorism. Possibly, possibly. Possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as you know, the airlines are now asking passengers to help subdue potential hijackers. Remember the good old days when flight attendants only had to fight off Frank Gifford and Gary Condit?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, TV executives met in Washington this week to discuss with the government what they can do to enhance America's image abroad. How about not coming up with any more shows like 'Temptation Island,' 'Fear Factor' and 'Blind Date'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest news from Afghanistan. . I don't know if you've heard this, but for the last couple of weeks.the US military has been blocking Afghanistan's radio waves and replacing them with US radio broadcasts. Isn't that interesting? Gets our word out, I guess. It's the latest news. Yeah, which also explains why people all over Afghanistan have been walking around saying, 'Bababooie.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks for coming out on such a rainy day. Boy, first rain of the season, isn't it? Unbelievable today. You know, people freak out here when it rains. LA is the only city in the world where people go, 'Anthrax? Ah, that's no problem. Terrorism, we can -- bubonic plague. By God, it's raining! Get the hell out of here!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a credible, unspecified warning. He said this week, we should be on the lookout for anything suspicious or unusual. What is that? It's Halloween. Everything is suspicious. What are you gonna do?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Report anything suspicious? Huh? Hey, how about Chicago Bears in first place? That's pretty suspicious. I mean, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey, that doesn't happen, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news &quot;continues to be a how-to manual for terrorists. All day -- all day, they've been reporting, ;President Bush will be attending the World Series game in New York City tonight. He'll be at the game between 5:00 and 9:00, Row E, Seat 6.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he was going to the game tonight to show that Americans will not be intimidated by terrorism. And Bush said he will continue to fight terrorism no matter how many baseball games he has to go to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going after caves that bin Laden has been known to hide in. Is that a good idea? I mean, if you bomb -- if you bomb the cave and you miss, aren't you just creating a new cave? I mean, it's just a vicious cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are now rumors -- well, it's not rumors, I think it's true. The Taliban has been poisoning those food packets we've been dropping in Afghanistan. You know, we should make a deal with the people of Afghanistan, okay? We'll taste their food, you open our mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is also urging American children to become pen pals with children in Islamic countries, which -- oh, there's a good idea. Who's gonna let their kid open a letter - 'Look, I got a letter from Afghanistan, mommy. Ooh, look.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest thing on the anthrax scare is the government is providing 100% free testing, free diagnosis, free office cleaning, free antibiotics and free treatment. That's if you're in Congress. If you work at the post office, you get a Bayer Asprin and some Bactine, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in Washington -- oh, now there's talk of microwaving the mail. Do you know about this? They zap the mail with radiation to kill the anthrax virus. And in fact, they're doing something similar in Beverly Hills. Except in Beverly Hills, see, what they do is they honey roast it over a mesquite wood fire. And then they just sear the outside, just slightly just sear the outside and then keep turning it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been.decontaminating offices in New Jersey, which -- why stop there? Let's just decontaminate New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Men, here's a little hint, okay? If you come home from work early and your wife is helping the mailman put on a condom, that has nothing to do with anthrax, okay? Don't fall for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a survey just out today, 54% of American lawyers said they would not represent terrorists on moral ground. The other 46% of the lawyers said, 'Moral ground? What's that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta announced a big change in airline security. Yeah, he said we're gonna get some.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ford Motor Company fired their top guy, the CEO, Jacques Nasser, yeah. Got fired. And it's cool how they did it. No pink slip. They just put him in a Ford Explorer with Firestone tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists say they have now created artificial sperm. This is true. It's gonna be marketed under the brand name, 'I can't believe it's not Clinton.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, speaking of Clinton -- did you hear about this? It seems his old girlfriend, Paula Jones -- remember her? Well, she got married over the weekend in Arkansas. I was thinking about this. Paula Jones is now married. Gennifer Flowers -- remember her? She's married. Remember that Miss America he dated? She's married. Do you realize, the only one of Clinton's women who isn't happily married is Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the Paula Jones marriage has caused quite a scandal in Little Rock. It seems it's a mixed marriage. She married outside the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, she married one of her neighbors. It was kinda nice. Instead of selling her house, she just pulled it up alongside his and they made a double wide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is going to throw out the first pitch&quot; at game three of the World Series. &quot;Isn't that cool? He's gonna be there and he's gonna throw out the pitch. Yeah, and then -- I read this -- then, to show solidarity with Yankee fans, the President is gonna throw the first battery at the other team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to have to ask you folks not to the applaud during tonight's show. Here's what happens. When you applaud, what happens is you circulates the spores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe we shouldn't be joking about this anthrax because I'm telling you everybody is worried. I mean they're just scared silly about anthrax. Last night for example, at the end of the evening, I'm paying my date. And honest to God, she was afraid to open the envelope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems like every day we're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. Here's what I learned about this guy today. He has 26 kids now from five different wives. Osama bin Laden has 26 kids, five different wives. Wasn't that the premise for Bonanza?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden is an evil madman who lives in a cave. It's like I have a twin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out the guy has a sidekick - Mini-Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, happy Halloween, everybody. Remember the good old days when Halloween was the only scary day of the year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it me, or do did you notice trick-or-treaters seem a little more paranoid this year? You know, it's not the same when the kids stand at the end of your driveway with a bullhorn, 'Throw the candy into the street. Back away from the candy. Throw the candy to the street.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you watch the World Series last night? Did you see President Bush? How about that? . He threw out a perfect strike. Perfect strike. It was a perfect strike. Let me tell you, after eight years of Bill Clinton, it is good to see a President with good aim, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said tonight it was the best athletic performance by a politician since Janet Reno sacked John Elway in Super Bowl XXXVII.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, everywhere you go, you can tell it's Halloween. Like today, their were a lot of people at the airport dressed as security guards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, our new Homeland Security Czar -- doesn't that sound like a Pepperidge Farm cookie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new guy, Tom Ridge, he announced a new zero-tolerance policy for airport security. Of course it's zero-tolerance, what else are you going to say, 'You know, we were going to allow one hijacker a month, but now, zero, zero tolerance.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the government has asked all Americans to be on high alert, which is pretty tough, to be high and alert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, authorities are also asking us to report if we see anything unusual -- like Dick Cheney. When was the last time you saw him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of this latest terrorism scare, they moved Cheney to a secret location. Remember the old days when no one cared where the Vice President was?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government says we should continue to go about our daily lives, get back to normal, do things as we would normally do, but stay on high alert. I mean, is that possible? That's like when you're in high school and you try to make out with your girlfriend while her dad's in the other room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight on the news, this is so unbelievable, they're saying on the news tonight that the anthrax mailed to the Federal office building contained silica, but not the compound bentonite. That would have made it more deadly. Anthrax with bentonite makes it more deadly. You know, as long as we're giving out the recipe for anthrax, why don't we send every terrorist a chemistry set too, possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington Post today asked Bob Dole if he had any advice for Al Gore. And Bob Dole said he would advise Al Gore to shave off the beard because Al's an attractive guy. Doesn't that seem kind of weird, Bob Dole finding Al Gore attractive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think maybe Bob needs to cut down on the dosage of the Viagra he's been taking?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reverend Jesse Jackson said that he thinks it would be better for America if Halloween were canceled. That's what he said. Yeah, and when asked about it -- when asked about it, Jesse said, 'Did I say Halloween? I'm sorry, I meant the sitcom Emeril.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that to get rid of the anthrax spores in the Senate office building, scientists announced they might use some kind of gas to just get rid of all of it. Yeah, and after hearing about it, Senator Strom Thurmond said, 'Don't bother, I've been filling that place with gas for years. There's nothing you can do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope tonight everybody is on a heightened state of alert. And believe me that's very hard to do watching this show. President Bush by the way, said we should resume our normal lives. Go on just as everything is fine. How many of you have been trying to do that? So last night I went home sat around in my underwear and drank a quart of malt liquor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see this last night at Yankee stadium President Bush threw out the first pitch of the ballgame? The White House said it was a strike. The Taliban said it missed and killed several innocent people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it seems like every day we're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. Here is what we know about this guy, he lives in a cave and every morning he gets up bright and early and changes the bat litter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy, Osama bin Laden, has $300 million, 26 kids, five different wives. Let's take a look at these statistics again. $300 million, 26 kids, five wives and what does he hate? The excessive American lifestyle. That's what he hates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't like to brag but I think my house was very popular this year. I was giving out the fun-sized Cipro. Very popular.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I had some trick or treaters come to the house last night. It's so cute when they come to the house. One kid comes, got a space suit on with these big heavy gloves, you know? I said 'Hey, what are you, an astronaut?' He goes, 'No, no I'm just a frightened US congressman.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night, when President Bush threw out that first pitch. Well, you know what's great, Bush comes out, he's wearing a firefighter's jacket. He threw out the first pitch of the World Series, and he's President of the US. He's living every 8 year old boys' dream. You know what I'm saying? Think about that. That's when you're a kid. You're a fireman, the President and a baseball pitcher all at once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Bush walked to the mound, did you see him lick his fingers? He did. He licked his fingers as he walked to the mound. See, that's something you never see Clinton do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, one kind of scary incident today. Earlier this afternoon, FBI officials find something slimy crawling down the hall at Congress. And turns out it was just Gary Condit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft announced this week that members of terrorist groups will no longer be allowed to enter the US. Well, duh!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were there lot of guys sitting around Washington when he said this going, 'Why didn't we think of that? Bob, take down those 'welcome terrorists' signs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a major announcement today, the Treasury Department has suspended the sale of all long-term, 30-year bonds. No more long-term, 30-year bonds. What better way to inspire confidence in our government than by telling people, &quot;We might not be here in 30 years?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charlton Heston is going to star in a movie as the Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele. Charlton Heston is gonna play a Nazi. Yeah, and Heston said, 'I'm looking forward to the role 'cause it's my first chance to play a liberal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you, forgive me, but I had a pretty big Halloween last night and I overdid it and I'm telling you, I think I had too much Cipro.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Pentagon, last night US Special Forces sneaked into a Taliban stronghold and smashed a dozen Jack o'Lanterns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember a couple of days ago they had the big FBI warning, a state of high alert. Do you remember the waring from the FBI? Turns out it was mainly for the Arizona Diamondbacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just amazing. For the first time ever the World Series went into November, for the first time ever went into November. And I thought, well why not? Last year we had an election that went into January, so.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the United States Army now bombing caves in Afghanistan trying to hit the one bin Laden is in. You know, this isn't even like a war anymore. It's like we're playing a giant game of whack-a-mole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you say it, the Al-Jazeera network? That Arab news network? Al- Jazeera, the Al-Jazeera network said they have received an authentic, hand-written letter from Osama bin Laden, signed by him personally which can be pretty valuable. That could be the last thing he ever writes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How'd you like to be the kid opening up the mail in that office, huh? 'Where's the new man? Johnson, get in here, open that mail.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the big November ratings sweeps race is under way. This is a time when the networks try to get their big, big, big, big numbers. Have you noticed the news gets a mottle more sensational? Like, did you see the local news last night? See the lead story? 'Anthrax at topless clubs -- are strippers at risk? We go undercover to find out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I tell you something, I think a lot of people are trying to use this anthrax scare to their own advantage. Like today, President Clinton told Hillary he got crabs from the mail. Now, you can't -- that's not -- you can't do that. That's not possible. That's not possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's something kind of scary. Health officials in Santa Clara County say 21 cows have died of anthrax. I didn't even know cows got mail, did you? Do cows get mail?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that he is banning members of terrorist groups from the United States. They are now banned. You know, this is amazing. We ban nail clippers at the airport. We ban nose trimmers at the airport. We ban parking at the airport. Why did it take a month to ban the terrorists? Shouldn't we ban them first, then the nail clippers? I mean, shouldn't the nail clippers be the last thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I had a nice drive to work today. Yeah, no bridges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, our Governor Gray 'the sky is falling' Davis said he learned of a credible threat to the bridges here in California. You know, every bridge is a threat in this state. Have you been on a bridge in the state? People are on cell phones, they're driving with their knees, they're putting on makeup, they're shooting guns out of the window. Every bridge is a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you something, and in San Francisco they're really paranoid. They have the National Guard up there guarding Nash Bridges, did you know that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a professor at Santa Clara University says that Republicans are three times more likely to have nightmares than Democrats. The most common Republican nightmare? That your wife is sleeping with a Democrat who is trying to raise your taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to an amazing new study published in the American Heart Journal, listen to this, prayer.improves the outcome for heart patient by 30%. Unless, of course, you're in an HMO, then you don't have a prayer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in other TV news, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is going to be guest-starring in an upcoming episode of 'Frazier.' That's when you know the economy is bad, okay? When Bill Gates is looking for a second job, a little something to help out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban government in Afghanistan, has long been critical of American culture, but it hasn't stopped them from taking American- made movies and changing the titles to make them more appealing to the Afghan audience. Okay? Here are some films that are currently running in theaters. These are playing at the Loew's Afghanaplex in Kabul. . For example, this first one here, this has become a huge hit since the war. 'Dude, Where's My Cave?' . Here's a film very popular with the Taliban, this one here -- 'Turban Cowboy.' And Afghani men went crazy for this one. A huge hit. 'Desperately Oppressing Susan.' Here's a reworked Disney film, very popular, that no one will get. 'That Darn Cat Stevens.' . And critics and audience -- boy, this is a huge comedy over there, this big one. 'Goat Busters.' This won the Afghan Emmy. Won 11 Afghan Emmys, this next one here. This is 'Dances With Wolf Blitzer.' This is a huge hit in Kabul. This one has them around the blocks for weeks. This is 'Seven Brides For One Dirt Bag.' And finally my favorite, everybody loves music, and, of course, the Afghan people, the Taliban, they love musicals. This a huge, huge hit. 'Singing In Bahrain.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal officials -- this is strange. Federal officials have indicted a suspicious student from San Diego whose first name is Osama. They indicted him. Yeah, the kid might be innocent, though, because his name is Osama Schwartz.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City is still on a very high state of alert, you know? The warning is still out. People are still very, very jumpy. And you got to...keep your eye out when you're on a high state of alert. And, you know, for me, that means when I'm on a high state of alert, I'm always...I'm always looking for...vice cops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, we're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. He is a multimillionaire who lives in a cave. Isn't that the premise of Batman? Isn't that the same? Bruce Wayne?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This weekend, of course, is the annual New York City Marathon. How many folks here tonight will be running in the New York City Marathon? How many? It's going to be a much bigger deal. It's going to take a lot longer to run this year. 40,000 runners in biohazard suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Friday night...and I think I felt fairly courageous about this for years and years and years, but now, in the light of the circumstances going on in this country, I think you see that it's even more heroic and more courageous that we do this, once a week we answer the mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A huge surprise at the Emmys last night. They didn't cancel them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess 'Sex and the City' won for best comedy series. Yeah, yeah. 'Sopranos' won for best actor and actress. So much for Hollywood's pledge for less sex and violence on TV, huh?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess security was a big concern at this year's Emmys. They had police -- they had SWAT teams everywhere. Had four snipers. Four snipers. Well, five if you count Joan Rivers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the latest speculation is now that terrorists are targeting California. Hey, earthquakes, fires, floods, drive-bys, smogs, gangs -- get in line. Shut up!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government put out a new warning today. And the government is comforting in times like this. I mean, government comes forward to put people at ease. Today they said, 'Don't inhale and don't touch anything. Other than that, go about your business as usual.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's an amazing story -- seven airline security workers at O'Hare Airport in Chicago today were fired. Did you hear about this? They let a man with nine knives, a stun gun and a can of mace in his carry-on bag get through the checkpoint. Guy had nine knives on him. On the bright side, they did confiscate his nail clippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney, still being kept safe at a secret location. It's secret, 'cause if Congress finds out about it, they'll be banging on the door going, 'Let us hide in there, too.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is so nervous about this anthrax thing. Like, we had a scare right here in Burbank just the other day -- I don't know if you knew about this -- Friday. You know, a suspicious guy moved in, just a couple houses across the street. Couple of houses. This guy kept getting shipments of chemicals, and he's always moving things around. You know, 'Ooh, what's that?' Thank God, turns out it's nothing but a good old American crystal meth lab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intelligence officials say that Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terrorist network is financed by the illicit sale of diamonds. They trade in diamonds, and that's how they get their money. So guys, when you give your best girl that cubic zirconium, you can tell her, 'I'm not being cheap, I'm fighting terrorism, okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Fox News Channel announced they have hired Geraldo Rivera to be their new war correspondent in Afghanistan. Finally a way to really annoy bin Laden, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Geraldo's first assignment -- find the secrets inside bin Laden's vault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And bin Laden released yet another video this past week. And this guy's got more videos out than 'N Sync now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, did you see that picture in the paper today of Hillary Clinton? She's wearing a surgical mask, and she's got rubber gloves on. I couldn't tell if she was getting ready to open mail or have sex with Bill. I don't know what was happening there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And New York this past weekend -- woo! Things gettin' real ugly. They got a mayor's race going on there. Things got real ugly between the two guys running, Mark Green and Michael Bloomberg. Oh, man, there were accusations of sexual harassment, racism - 'No, you're a racist.' And slanderous TV campaigns and name-calling and -- let me tell you something -- if this has not proved that New York is finally getting back to normal, nothing is. Yeah! So good to see that New York spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sneaked up on us, but tomorrow here in New York City is election day. And I want to tell you one thing if you could be here in New York watching this mayoral campaign, I think you'd have to agree with me, it's a darn shame that only one of these candidates can lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Tesaye Jifar from Ethiopia. He is the New York City marathon champion and in a record time of 2:07. And I want to tell you something -- what did I say? 2:07. It's amazing, isn't it? And it's tough. Really tough this year, he was running at 26 miles in a biohazard suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new poll of kids taken across the country shows 40% of kids still believe Santa Claus exists. 30% of kids still believe the Easter Bunny exists. Only 10% of kids believe airport security exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that's the big story this week. Eight security workers at O'Hare Airport in Chicago were suspended. I said they got fired the other day. Oh, they didn't; they get suspended. Apparently, this is not a big enough offense.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy walked through security carrying nine knives, a stun gun and a can of mace. I didn't know OJ was traveling again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy was on an expired visa, had all these weapons. He said he didn't mean any harm. The only reason he was getting on the plane was to fly down to Washington to thank Congress for voting down that bill to tighten airline security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the FAA said they may reverse the government policy and require airlines to match checked bags with the proper passengers before takeoff to increase security. Who are they kidding? Matching baggage with the passengers? Please, most airlines can't match the baggage with the proper city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney is currently in South Dakota on a three-day hunting trip. What better place for a man who's had four heart attacks than to be carrying a big gun and a backpack through the snow looking for red meat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, he's quite a sportsman. The Washington papers are reporting that Cheney shot five pheasants. Although today the Taliban claimed he hit two Red Cross centers and a hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mayo Clinic says they have developed a new one-hour anthrax test. See, this is why I love America. This is more proof that the terrorists will not win. We can take any threat and turn it into a business and open a store with it in the mall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Honey, when you're in the mall at Wicks and Things and Lenscrafters, would you stop by the one-hour anthrax, pick up my test?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The virgin Britney Spears says she wants to go on a USO tour, which I think is great. You know, she'd be great at that. She'd show our boys what they're fighting for and show the Taliban what they're fighting against. You see what I'm saying? You kill two birds with one stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hurricane Michelle, battering Cuba and the Bahamas. Oh, man. And to be on the safe side, our Governor, Gray 'The Sky is Falling' Davis, said today, he warned residents of California, 'Stay off the bridges, the hurricane could turn left at any minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new mayor here, James Hahn, nobody knows this, he got elected months ago. He's meeting with the heads of two Mexican airlines. They're going to discuss ways to increase the number of travelers coming to LA. Is that a big problem? Getting people in Mexico to come to LA?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the big winners&quot; at the Emmys &quot;were, what, the West Wing and Sex in the City. Those were the big winners, West Wing, Sex in the City. Remember the good old days when you could get both of those shows rolled into one with President Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of the Taliban are hiding out in civilian areas and trying to pass themselves off as ordinary people. That's what they're doing. Yeah, apparently, the Taliban got the idea from the Scientologists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Northern Alliance says that they're making progress against the Taliban. You know the Northern Alliance, they're the allies we'll have to fight next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar has challenged George W. Bush to a duel. And Bush said, 'All right, as long as we can have it in Florida.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose this is a kind of thing that we shouldn't let shake our confidence but a couple of weeks ago the Pentagon started telling people here, citizens folks like you and me, if you have any insight how we can fight terrorism, get in touch with us. But you know it hasn't been that effective, and I mean it's just a bunch of guys, 'Oh, yeah what about Batman? Have you contacted batman?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Think about this. The new mayor will either be Michael Bloomberg or Mark Green, one of the two men the new mayor of New York City. Wait a minute. I bet this is exactly what the FBI was trying to warn us about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last Sunday night, 40 million people watched game seven of the World Series. The sad part -- most of those people watching the TV were airport security guards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they had more problems today at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. It seems both Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands were able to get on the United flight without even being checked.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You gotta wonder where they get some of these security people. Like, I flew over the weekend, you know, and I'm emptying my pockets, going through the metal detector. And when I came through, I said to the guy, 'Excuse me, can I have my keys and my watch, please?' He goes, 'Uh, you want fries with that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says Osama bin Laden now trying to acquire nuclear weapons. I got an idea -- let's send him one of ours, huh? We got some extras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Geraldo Rivera has quit his job at CNBC and is going to work for the Fox News Network. Oh, yeah, like you watch CNBC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he's gonna work for Fox as the Afghanistan correspondent. How many people think sending Geraldo to Afghanistan is a bad idea? How many think bringin' him back is a worse idea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;California Governor Gray 'The Sky Is Falling' Davis in the news again today. Gray Davis announced that because of the terrorists, he is urging all Californians to look both ways before crossing the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember that announcement that Governor Davis made the other day, saying that terrorists were going to attack -- they were going to attack the bridges in California. We had all these people guarding bridges. Well, now the FBI said, no, no, the intelligence behind those warnings were not credible. And today, Governor Davis said he was shocked. He said, 'I can't believe it. Miss Cleo is never wrong. I'm paying $2.99 a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to weight watchers, Americans are now turning to fattening foods to help ease all the anxiety we're facing over terrorism. They say we're all eating more junk food than we normally do. You know what that means? Forget terrorists. Our bridges could wind up collapsing under our own weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mayo clinic says they have developed a one-hour anthrax test. See, this is so typical American, isn't it? We're not afraid of anthrax, we're just afraid the test takes too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Americans are finally going out and spending money. Yesterday, a guy in New York named Michael Bloomberg, spent $50 million to buy a mayor's race. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, New York elected billionaire Mike Bloomberg to be their next mayor. And listen to this -- his personal fortune is $4 billion. Can you believe that? He's got $4 billion. . But I think he may be out of touch with the average New Yorker, 'cause his first official act was naming a commissioner of caviar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new mayor in New York. It's pretty exciting isn't it? Yesterday we had the election and today we're returning the crooked voting machines to Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg. I'll tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, it goes to show you, you have a dream, determination, stamina, there's nothing you can't accomplish with $50 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about this whacky Osama bin Laden. We know he lives in a cave. We know that. Apparently at one point in his life he was a womanizer. This guy was a womanizer. He wouldn't quit. Finally all of that stopped and he settled down with his five wives and had 26 kids. So that...all of that is behind him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, Osama bin Laden had a drinking problem. You know? I think that makes sense if you're 45 and living in a cave, I would bet booze somehow...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just two weeks to go until Thanksgiving, you know what that means. At O'Hare airport, they'll be letting people through with carving knives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the folks at O'Hare airport call an AK-47, a smart bomb and a flame thrower? Carry-on luggage.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just O'Hare, security at all the airports, it's terrible. Like here at Burbank, you know Burbank airport doesn't even have a metal detector? All they have is an old guy wearing a cheap pair of those X-ray specs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even here at NBC, they say, 'Oh, security's been tightened.' Tightened? How tight can it be? We had Puff Daddy on last night. Puff Daddy got through. How did that happen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's amazing? Through all of this, Congress cannot agree on an air-security bill. Isn't this amazing? Congress only takes, what, half a day to vote themselves a big pay rise, but six months to pass an air- security bill. Why is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;LA officials announced today, listen to this, in the event of a biological or chemical attack, victims should not go to hospitals. They said if victims went to the hospitals that could shut down the health care system. Where are you supposed to go, Denny's for the free meal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a more serious note, earlier tonight, President Bush addressed a nation on some of the networks. NBC and CBS refused to preempt 'Friends' and 'Survivor' for the President. God forbid, let's hope the enemy never attacks on a Thursday night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC did say if President Bush says anything significant, they're gonna have Chandler mention it to Monica on 'Friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration, their job is to keep up the country's morale. We're in a war, we've gotta keep our people interested in the war. And God bless him, you know Ari Fleischer the press secretary? Did you see what he's doing every day to keep the country up? Each day, at the press briefings, well, look, see, he's wearing a different toupee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's still no word on the exact location of Osama bin Laden. You know who we should use to find him? You know who we should use to help us find him? Classmates.com. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Geraldo Rivera headed for Afgstan. Boy, you thought those people hated us before?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City has a new mayor. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is the new mayor. And he says, even though he's a billionaire, he will look out for the little people. You know, like the millionaires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Virginia Supreme Court, in its wisdom this week, voted to overturn a 1968 law saying you can now legally burn a cross on your front lawn. In Virginia, it's now okay to burn crosses on your lawn. God forbid you should try to burn a pile of leaves in the fall, that'll get you jail time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, scientists at Princeton University announced the odds of a giant asteroid hitting the earth in the next 100 years and wiping out all civilization are 1 in 5,000.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard about this. Today, Governor Davis discovered another serious threat, his chances of reelection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Opening tomorrow, the new movie 'Shallow Hal,' about a guy who is a sleazy pick-up artist, who suddenly becomes attracted to overweight women. I think the original title was 'The Bill Clinton Story.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mariah Carey announced this week she intends to keep on acting. Hey, haven't we been terrorized enough, ladies and gentlemen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mike Bloomberg was elected Mayor of New York this week. And I don't know if you know this -- this is true -- he spent $50 million of his own money. That's the most anyone's ever -- $50 million. Ridiculous. Because for that kind of money, he could have bought two tickets to 'The Producers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what they say about this guy, this Mayor-elect Bloomberg, they say he is a business genius. And I'm thinking, gee, really, he's a business genius? I don't know, he spent $50 million to get a $100,000 a year job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he and Mayor Giuliani have a lot in common. Both of them have girlfriends and neither one can get Donna Hanover out of Gracie Mansion, so...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taliban leader Mullah Omar has challenged George Bush to a duel, and he countered...Bush countered the challenge, he challenged Omar to six innings of T-ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush thought it over and he decided he'd go ahead with the duel. He's going to go ahead with duel. He told 'Little Jeb' and Pa to meet him at the corral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. For example, in college, Osama bin Laden was a loner. He was a loner. The only fun he would have would be in the springtime when he would go to Daytona Beach for spring jihad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a big drinker. He's, like, a drunk, this Osama bin Laden. His favorite bar is 'Thank Allah, it's Friday.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not true. Osama bin Laden quit drinking years ago, quit drinking years ago. But it's funny now, ironically, he's still getting bombed every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on with the big war. Maybe you heard about this. Over there in Afghanistan, we're now starting to use these 15,000- pound bombs called daisy cutters. Did you hear about these things? Biggest conventional weapon know to man. They weigh almost 8 tons, 17 feet wide, 5 feet high. And here's the most amazing part, yesterday at O'Hare airport somebody was able to sneak one past security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really do have to beef up our airport security. You know, I flew over the weekend. And I forgot to take the keys out of my pocket. You know when I went through the metal detector, so the alarm goes off, and you know the siren goes around there and the light's flashing. Finally the guy working there goes outside and starts hitting the machine. He's goin', 'I hate when it does that. Go ahead, sir. Why is it doing this? Does anybody know?.Every ten minutes this thing goes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Listen to this. Officials at Baltimore/Washington airport are now trying to entertain passengers standing in the long lines by hiring mimes, jugglers and clowns. Hey, how about just hiring more security people!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I read in the paper today -- I don't even understand how this works -- nearly 2,000 international terrorists, known terrorists, have made their way into the United States in the past ten years. Nobody knows where they are. We can't find 2,000 terrorists, yet one fruit fly shows up on a tree in Pomona and we not only get the fly, we get everybody the fly spoke with. 'We have the fly, we have his friends.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, President Bush visited the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta where he spoke with the workers. See that's the difference between Bush and Clinton right there. See, Bush goes to the Center for Disease Control to make a speech, Clinton goes to get swabbed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many watched the President's speech last night? Did you watch it? It's hard to keep Americans interested, isn't it? Last night, in his speech to the nation, President Bush asked all Americans to get back to normal. The executives here at NBC took him up on it and aired 'Friends' instead. Yeah, put 'Friends' on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC and CBS decided not to air the President's speech because they didn't want to preempt their two hit shows. So ABC had the speech. And ABC spokesmen said they aired the speech because they thought it was important, it was patriotic and they don't have a hit on Thursday night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see ABC was scared of losing, you know, to the competition. They didn't want people switching over and watching the other -- look what they did during Bush's speech last night. Run that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is the most accurate, up-to-date information we have to medical professionals and to the public. We created the new Office of Homeland Security. Ooh, here's some good news. The Mayo Clinic says they have developed a one-hour anthrax test. The bad news is, they send you the results through the mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something interesting. We're getting closer -- we're getting closer to the bottom of this thing. Earlier today, a bioterrorism task force said that a teaspoon of anthrax, you know, that was sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's office, said it could have come from either Iraq or New Jersey. Now, see, I got to go with Iraq. I don't believe New Jersey has the technology available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Geraldo Rivera has quit his job on CNBC and is going to Afghanistan to become a war correspondent for FOX. Great. Finally something for both sides to shoot at now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden released another video yesterday. This one shows four of his sons dancing around the wreckage of a US helicopter. One of our helicopters crashed. Luckily, our men were saved. Nobody was injured. But this video shows his son dancing around the wrecked helicopter. I believe his son's are Lance bin Laden, Joey bin Laden and J.C. And Justin bin Laden. They call themselves 'bin sync,' if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What else has been happening? Oh, the US has been dropping leaflets into Afghanistan that read, 'we're watching you.' And they have pictures of the leader, what's his name? Mullar Momad Omar. That's his name. They show his car. No, the satellite shows pictures of his car, his SUV. And you can actually see the license -- show that. A little psychological edge. . You see the bumper sticker? Look. My Son Is An Honor Student At Osama's Terrorist Camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know, people don't realize how hard this is. Fighting a war in Afghanistan is tough. It's like playing Monopoly where every property is Baltic Avenue. You know what I mean? Four bucks, four bucks. . There's no Park Place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this week, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether repetitive stress injuries are a disability. You know what workers have the most repetitive stress injuries? What do you think? Computers? No, no. 7-11 clerks. The money's in the can. The money's in the drawer. The money's in the drawer. The money's in the drawer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Veterans Day. We have some veterans here today? How about a nice hand for our veterans? You know, I was thinking about that. You know, I never understood the whole -- the VFW hall. They're called veterans of foreign wars. But aren't all veterans veterans of foreign wars?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, is there still the odd Civil War veteran out there trying to - 'Hey, you, Johnny Reb, can't you read the sign?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ellis Island closed 47 years ago today. If you don't know what that is, that's where they used to process immigrants coming into the country. That, of course, was back in the days when we would actually process immigrants coming into the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI announced today they now believe that the person responsible for mailing out those anthrax letters is an adult male with a grudge. Yeah, you think? 'Good work. What do we owe you, fellas? Hell of a job. We'll go round 'em up right now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to news reports, the Taliban is said to be retreating from the city of Kabul. I guess we have Kabul, or whatever they -- Kaboom, whatever they call 'em over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, the Taliban not putting up much of a fight. There's no resistance whatsoever. It's like they're the Detroit Lions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rumor is that Geraldo Rivera is now inside Afghanistan, although we don't have any actual proof that he is there. We don't have any proof that he's in Afghanistan now, but the Afghan people look a little more irritated and annoyed than usual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems if Al Gore had asked for a complete state recount -- recount of the whole state -- he may have narrowly won and therefore won the election. See, it's easy to say Al Gore could've won if he had a different legal strategy. Hey, he could've won if he had a different personality, too, possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm reading this article, it's in the LA Times. And at the end of the article, they say George Bush eventually won the state and won the 2000 presidential election. Is it really necessary to clarify that? I mean, if you don't know that Bush is President, what are the odds you know how to read a newspaper?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Marie Claire magazine, the US is the most sexually active country in the world. Well, see -- you see that? It's nice to see that all the work Clinton did in the '90s is finally paying off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, everyone's in a good mood on Fridays. You're probably also in a good mood -- who saw President Bush's speech last night? Always fun to see the President, huh? One guy in the band, two people in the audience. That explains a lot. No, this is a true story. Last night, NBC showed an episode of 'Friends' instead of President Bush's national address. That's right. And get this -- here's the interesting part. 'Friends' got double the ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, fortunately this will not happen again, 'cause afterwards, President Bush announced he and Rachel are having a baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of NBC, yesterday -- this is strange -- two Air Force fighter jets forced a plane carrying several NBC executives to land 'cause the plane lost radio contact. True story. Yeah, and then the military forced the NBC executives to cancel 'Emeril.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, you can sure tell the election is over. On my lunch hour today, I'm walking through Central Park and I see a squirrel scraping a 'Mark Green' sticker off his nuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a big weekend planned. I'm going to ice down some beer and watch Uncle Sam take out Taliban amo dumps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're using some very powerful sophisticated weaponry over there in Afghanistan. The United States is dropping this whole new generation of bombs. First it was the bunker-buster, then after that, they went to something called the daisy cutter, and now they're using a new device, the salad spinner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you like me in are you worried about the Northern Alliance. I'm a little nervous about the Northern Alliance. Today they said they could not attack because it's allergy season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's more bad news. You know that Osama bin Laden? Experts now say that it looks like the guy will probably survive the winter. And you know how he's going to do it? Well, they think he's just going to eat all the food stuck in his beard. He'll be fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe you don't know about this. A couple of days ago, we had an election here and we got us a new mayor. It's Mayor-elect Mike Bloomberg, mayor Mike, are you excited about.listen to what happened today. He started thinking about all the problems and all the trouble for New York City. He's demanding a recount.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Northern Alliance officially captured Kabul. And the Taliban has left the city. True story. Yeah, the -- the Taliban claims they're not leaving Kabul 'cause they're scared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They just think there are better schools in the suburbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some leads coming up now in the whole anthrax thing. Government investigators say the person responsible for the anthrax mailings is probably a man who is a loner with no social life or girlfriend. That's what they said. Yeah, true story. And in a related story, I've hired a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Afghanistan good news the Taliban is fleeing Kabul, have you heard about that? So among other things what this means is the people in Kabul can now watch television for the first time in ten years. It's like a big deal for them. They're getting out the set hooking it up turning it on and all over the city you can hear people saying, 'Boy, Dave got old.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the people in Kabul are going nuts shaving beards, throwing away their turbans, lining up to see 'Shallow Hal'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of the takeover all of the Taliban leaders are trying to get out of Kabul. It's crazy. Yesterday the local U-Haul ran out of camels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban is retreating from the city of Kabul and we are starting to win the war. According to military analysts, the turning point came when we sent in Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story is, the Taliban and its soldiers have retreated from the capital of Afghanistan. There you go. The military said they haven't seen government officials leave a capital that quick, well, since Congress found there was anthrax in the mailroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably saw this on the news. Last night in Kabul, people were dancing in the streets, they were playing music. One woman stripped down, right down to her nose. Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like we're gonna have to set up a new government in Afghanistan, which is not gonna be easy. Hey, after our last election, look how long it took to set up our own government. Four months, and we didn't even know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The New York Times said today the Northern Alliance is already looting Kabul. What is there to loot? 'Look at these great rocks I got!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market rebounded nicely after this little victory in Afghanistan. The biggest winner -- the new Super Cut chain in Kabul. The new Super Cut. Got the guys shaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech today, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said America will deliver more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. If that works out, the Red Cross might think about helping New York, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently the Red Cross has only given out about 25% of the $564 million it raised, you know, to the September 11th victims. And the Red Cross says there's a perfectly good reason for this. As soon as they figure out what it is, they're gonna let us know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how patriotic some people are, when it suits them. You've all heard people talking like this. You hear middle-aged guys saying stuff - 'Let me tell you something -- I love this country, man. Let me tell you what -- you send me to Afghanistan, you give me a parachute, you give me a gun, you drop me off there for three weeks, I'll show this Taliban who's boss. I'll clean that country right up.' You send these same to jury duty, notice they go, 'Hey, I haven't got time for this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I keep hearing how Americans are coping with the stress of war by turning to comfort foods like meatloaf and mashed potatoes. See, this is why America is unique. We're the only country where citizens have too much food during a war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, during World War II, you didn't see people walking around Eastern Europe going, &quot;Whoo! I hope they defeat Hitler, I can't fit in my pants anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Russian President Putin are now at the Bush ranch down there in Texas. This is history in the making. This is really historic. It's the first time in modern history cold war adversaries become allies. You know what that means? That means there's hope for Bill and Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you know, Geraldo Rivera is going to Afghanistan. So you know what that means -- bin Laden no longer the most despised guy in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know one of bin Laden's wives is also his first cousin? He's married to his first cousin. See, that explains why he prefers living in southern Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The producers of 60 Minutes fired two people because of the extra expense of covering the war on terrorism. They say it's costing a lot of money, so they had to let two people go on 60 Minutes. And after hearing about the layoffs, Mike Wallace said, 'I haven't been this worried about losing my job since the Civil War.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the Taliban left Kabul -- they fled Kabul. After they left, many Afghanis in the city shaved their beards. Completely shaved them off. And when asked why they shaved their beards, the Afghanis said, 'We're sick of looking like Al Gore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the Taliban was driven out of Kabul, the Afghani people listened to music on the radio for the first time in five years. 'Cause it was outlawed. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, and then after -- after listening to several new songs, the Afghanis said, &quot;N Sync seems very gay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban has fled Kabul. And now, now that the Taliban is gone you can now smoke, you can dance, you can play music. I'm telling you Kabul once again is fun city, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Taliban is on the run. They are hiding out and they don't know where to go. Because Pakistan does not want them. Iran does not want them. However, of course, they'll have no problem getting into this country, but that's another story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's interesting with the Taliban gone they're allowed to play all kinds of music. Listen to this, Kenny G. is back in the elevators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The men are allowed to shave and cut their hair, and Osama bin Laden has shaved his beard as well. He's trying to pass as Ben Kingsley on a promotional tour for 'Sexy Beast.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the Taliban was in charge you couldn't watch television. So now they're gone people are digging up their TVs after ten years. All over the country they are turning them on and saying 'Oh, Leno is guest hosting for Carson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush and Vladmir Putin, Putin is at President Bush's ranch. Vladmir Putin is down there in Texas at the big ranch. In his honor George Bush had an old-fashioned hoedown. I was thinking about this. The last time President Clinton had a hoedown he got impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much. Welcome to the Tonight Show. Thank you. That round of applause lasted longer than the Taliban! I can't believe it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, what a difference a few days make, huh? Whoever thought the women of Afghanistan would be showing their faces and the men of the Taliban would be afraid to show theirs?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really great over there. The guys are now shaving off their beards. If we could just get Al Gore to do that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, in Afghanistan now, instead of food, our planes are dropping giant cans of Gilette Foamy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it's not just the men. Women are taking off their veils for the first time in six years. In fact, they showed guys yelling at women, 'Show us your teeth! Show us your teeth!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kabul, it's goodbye burkha -- hello thong!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's going on with Osama bin 'Hidin?' Nobody knows where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does the Taliban differ from the Detroit Lions? The Taliban has a running game!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden knows he's in trouble. Today he spent the entire day in his cave on the cell phone trying to reach probably the only man that can help him, Johnnie Cochran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now they say the Taliban is trying to regroup, and that moderates have taken over in the Taliban. You know what moderates are in the Taliban? They still stone you to death, but they give you an Advil first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And 98-year-old Senator Strom Thurmond, who is still in good health, has moved into a Washington hospital. That's when you know you're getting old. When you actually live at the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, apparently he skipped the retirement home thing. Moved directly into the hospital. That's not a good sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the Taliban's left Kabul, the Northern Alliance decided to resume television broadcasts for the first time in five years. Isn't that great? They're showing TV again. It was outlawed. Now it's back on. Yeah, and immediately after they started showing TV again, the Afghanis said, 'Hey, what's &quot;Buffy&quot; doing on UPN?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, and I hate talking about people when they ain't here. But last night -- what a lousy audience. What a rough crowd last night. The entire audience last night was on an FBI watch list, the whole audience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've been reading about what's going on in Kabul. It's an amazing transformation in a couple of days. It just turned upside down and retail stores, business is booming. Except for one store, that 'Veils for Less.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban is out of the picture and people are getting their TV's back and watching TV for the first time in ten years. They're stunned. They can't believe the cast of 60 Minutes is still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've had no music in Afghanistan and the whole country musically speaking is completely backward, they think P. Diddy is still Puff Daddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read today a group of evangelists are warning parents the 'Harry Potter' books are evil because they promote wizardry. In fact, today, Jerry Falwell now says, 'Reading is gay!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like the war in Afghanistan may be over pretty soon. Thank God for that. Let's just hope -- folks -- let's just hope the shooting doesn't stop before Geraldo gets there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said tonight on the news that if Osama bin Laden is captured, he won't go on trial in a US court of law. He'll appear before a military tribunal, which has a lower threshold of proving somebody guilty. Isn't that right? A little different. See, in a normal trial, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In a military trial, all the attorney has to do is tell them, 'your honor, look at the guy. Come on!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the bounty is on bin Laden's head? $25 million. Well, that seems like a lot, until you realize the Texas Rangers paid $250 million to get Alex Rodriguez.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And more bad news today for the Taliban. Oh, gosh. Remember how they were promised 72 virgins when they die? Remember that? Turns out, it's just one 72-year-old virgin. Yeah, that's what it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government said today -- the government said today the [rescued aid workers'] flight back will take 20 hours and 3 seconds. 20 hours for the flight, the medical exam. Three seconds to go through security at O'Hare airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it looks like airport security is going to be taken over now by Federal workers, but they said not for a couple of years. Isn't that great? They're not even hired yet. They're already moving slowly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'People' magazine has named Pierce Brosnan 'the sexiest man alive.' They named actor Benjamin Bratt 'sexiest single guy alive.' And Bill Clinton got 'sexiest married guy who acts like a single guy alive.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a recent interview, Vice President Dick Cheney said that, for the past two months, he's been hiding out in one secret location after another. That's what he's been doing. Yeah, Cheney said he got the idea from Mariah Carey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The New York Post' celebrated its 200th birthday today. Isn't that great? Yeah, apparently, as part of its celebration, 'The Post' honored its original paper boy, Strom Thurmond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think your weekend is dull. Listen to this. Osama bin Laden will be in his cave all weekend with Mullah Omar playing checkers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to the Northern Alliance. They defeated the Taliban. And now they move on to face the winner of the Southern Conference in the Sugar Bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's great now that the Taliban is on the run. Afghans have not been allowed to watch television for ten years. And so now they're getting their televisions out and they're hooking them up and stuff and they're amazed and they're stunned and excited because tonight on 'Inside The Actor's Studio,' it's the interview with Jon Voight, so they can hardly wait to get there for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sunday night on the al-Jazeera network, it's the Kathy Lee Gifford Ramadan special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning more and more about Osama bin Laden. This guy has five wives, and one of them, one of his wives is his 14-year-old cousin. Isn't that crazy? He married his 14-year-old cousin. Of course in those days, he was known as Jerry Lee bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people in Afghanistan are watching television for the first time in years and the Afghans cannot believe what they're seeing. The luxury, the food, the homes and get this, they're watching 'Survivor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only are they watching TV, they're also listening to music for the first time in 10 years and that's finally some good news for Hootie and the Blowfish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's being reported the number two most hated man in Afghanistan has been wiped out by US forces. I hope they're not talking about Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, Osama bin Laden is doing strange things to avoid capture. Last night, bin Laden snuck into a cave, went left, then right, then left, then down a secret elevator and into a very tiny room. Here's the weird part. Kato was there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Court TV and ABC announced today, they will hold a fake trial of Osama bin Laden -- you know, pretty much what we're going to do when we catch him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said today he is worried Osama bin Laden may have fled Afghanistan. He says, because the country has such porous borders -- you see, Afghanistan is such a backwards country, people can sneak across the border without ever being detected. Well, thank god that kind of thing could never happen in this country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest reports are that bin Laden may have snuck out of Afghanistan on a donkey. I mean, how pathetic is that? He's telling people, 'Don't shoot, I'm not bin Laden. I'm Juan Valdez, the coffee guy.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the Taliban has fled, for the first time in six years, men in Afghanistan are shaving. They're shaving for the first time in six years -- like the women of France now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in years in Kabul, the television station is back on the air. I guess our Kabul affiliate, they are probably watching this now -- our Kabul affiliate. You know the number one show in Afghanistan, 'The Flintstones.' That's the number one show, only in Afghanistan it's called 'The Jetsons,' because it's so futuristic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not looking good for the Taliban. Today, one of their top commanders took a head count. Only half of his guys had one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the head of the Northern Alliance has reassured the United States he has no plans for stealing power. He says he is willing to share control of Afghanistan, which means, of course, in five years, we will be fighting them now, with our new friends the Taliban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress finally agreed to an airport security bill. You know why they did it now? It didn't have anything to do with them flying home for Thanksgiving, huh, gee?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of gas in Los Angeles has dropped to $1.12 a gallon. It's amazing. Unbelievable. You drop a few bombs in the Middle East, and suddenly the price of oil becomes reasonable again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest UN reports, nobody seems to be in charge now of Afghanistan. I mean, they have armed gangs from every ethnic group, roaming the streets, just shooting guns at will. So it's like LA without the traffic.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the first French troops arrived in Afghanistan. Oh, that's big, the French show up after the enemy has left. 'Oh, bonjour, we are here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has hired ten look-alikes to travel around the country and pose as him. How hard-up do you have to be before this job looks good to you, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in years, well over six years, Afghanistan now has music playing on the radio. Music was banned. And now they have music again. And today there are reports the Taliban are going around shooting each other in the back. So apparently it's rap music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new airline security bill that was passed this week. Because of this bill, the security employees will be Federalized union workers. So not only will they be incompetent, they'll also be able to go on strike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess under this new bill, passengers will be charged $2.50 each time they get on a flight. $2.50 will go towards increase security. $2.50? I mean, the headset is $5.00. Shouldn't it be the other way around?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the travel industry says the average person will travel 100 miles this Thanksgiving, except the Detroit Lions. They can't go ten yards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush carried out the traditional pardoning of the White House turkey. The turkey will live out the rest of its years at a petting zoo in rural Virginia, which is the same place they're hiding Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our old friend Al Gore has taken a new job as vice chairman of a financial services company here in Los Angeles. Vice chairman? What is it about this guy? He can't make it to president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People magazine has just come out with the sexiest man alive issue. Why do they have to clarify the alive part? Huh? Are they trying keep out Al Gore and Keith Richards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in Afghanistan -- true story -- after five years of being shut down, the movie theater in Kabul opened. Isn't that nice? They reopened it. . Yeah, the first film shown since the Taliban left is called, 'Dude, where's my camel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is suing -- get this -- he's suing the US military because the US military won't let Hustler cover the war in Afghanistan. So he's suing them. Yeah, but they have a reason. The military said, 'Sorry, but we awarded exclusive coverage to 'Bootylicious' magazine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President -- I'm sorry. Former Vice President -- that's right. It's close. Former Vice President Al Gore has accepted a job as vice chairman of a company called Metropolitan West Financial. Gonna be his new job. Yeah, when asked about it, Gore said, 'I finally found a job as boring as I am.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things have turned upside down completely within a couple of weeks. Unbelievable. Now Afghanistan says they're looking for help from other countries, because they want to get into the television business, and I said to myself...what a coincidence, so does CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That Al Qaeda organization, they have ten Osama bin Laden look- alikes. It's amazing. Listen to this, one of them is Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten Osama bin Laden look-alikes, and they say soon they'll all be available for private parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only movie theater in Kabul reopened for business yesterday, and last night there was a line like a mile and a half long to get into see the feature presentation, and I believe it was 'Dude, where's my camel?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in the top physical condition of my life. Here's how I do it. I'll share something with you, every morning I get up and do the Taliban army exercise. Here's how they go. Take couple of deep breaths. And raise your arms above your head. And then you leave them there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Starting in January, all airlines will be screening checked luggage for bombs. Why do we announce that we are starting in January? Why don't we say, 'Attention, terrorists, you have one month to get your bomb on board!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, here's something I thought was very nice. You know, Bush is doing a great job. On Wednesday, President Bush named the Justice Department headquarters after Robert Kennedy. And then he went around the corner and named a strip club after Ted. And I thought that was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad they're [the Detroit Lions] doing, after the game yesterday, they tried to surrender to the Northern Alliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And French troops arrived in Afghanistan this week. Whoo! Just in the nick of time, huh? Whoo! They saved our butts, didn't they? But they can't stay long. Next week they're shipping out to Poland to stop Hitler from invading France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Taliban leaders in Southern Afghanistan announced today they will make one last stand rather than surrender. That's a good idea, huh? I mean, that last stand thing worked out so well for Custer, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was watching this Peter Berg -- the CNN reporter. This guy interviewed Osama bin Laden like last week. And he says he can't believe how pale bin Laden's skin is. He says, 'Bin Laden is almost white from hiding out in these caves.' But the good news is apparently our B-52s are installing skylights in some of the caves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. Mint announced today they are laying of 350 workers. The U.S. Mint laying off people, that's not a good sign when you can't make money even when you're making the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ted Turner -- you all know Ted Turner -- he told 'The Atlanta Journal' he's not too happy these days. He says, 'It's not been easy the last two years to wake up and find you don't have a job and your wife's gone.' And today Robert Blake said, 'It's not that bad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't kid yourselves. There are bargains everywhere. Everywhere you go, there are bargains. For example, today, Osama bin Laden knocked 30% off the price on his head, 30% off. 'Come and get me.' 30% off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One good thing about this Thanksgiving, because of all the security, you know, I got to drive my family to the airport five hours earlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had the big Letterman family Thanksgiving at my house. I didn't go this year. I sent one of my look-alikes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are saying Santa Claus could be late this year. Sure, a foreigner with a beard and a bunch of packages, good luck getting in the country, pal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see this at Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport -- a hunting rifle accidentally went off at the ticket counter. This is unbelievable. I'm not making this up. Guy was going on a hunting trip, and he wanted to show the Delta ticket agent that the rifle wasn't loaded and shot out a window. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But it was so loud it actually woke up three of the security people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since nobody was hurt, they let the guy board the plane. He got on the plane. Isn't this amazing? They decided he wasn't a threat because after the gun went off the guy went, 'oops' and a terrorist wouldn't have done that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the White House information center, the former president of Afghanistan was castrated by the Taliban when they took power five years ago. They castrated the leader of the country. You thought Clinton was worried about being impeached?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA today revealed why they think the Taliban has been fighting so badly. After one of our raids on the Taliban headquarters, it turns out the Taliban was using an old Detroit Lions playbook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now saying the Taliban leaders are moving to the rural areas of Afghanistan. Rural areas? Anybody here mistake Kabul for the Epcot Center? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in five years, the people of Afghanistan are being allowed to watch television. The biggest problem is the Afghan people trying to remember where they left the remote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;French troops arrived in Afghanistan last week and not a minute too soon. Thank you, France. Apparently, the French are acting as advisers for the Taliban to teach them how to surrender properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you who's got the toughest job over there. Our Air Force pilots. God bless these guys. These guys have to make incredibly hard split- second decisions every day. Say they're flying over Afghanistan and they see bin Laden over here and they see Geraldo Rivera over there, and they only have one bomb. What do they do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company in western Massachusetts has become the first company ever to successfully clone a human being. Isn't that unbelievable? Imagine that. They are cloning human beings in Massachusetts. You know what this means? More Kennedys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has come out against human cloning. He said today, and I quote, 'We recoil at the idea of growing human beings for spare body parts.' And today, Cher and Michael Jackson said, 'We do?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You folks been following the news? The Taliban has collapsed faster than the New York Giants' defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day, of course, we're finding out more and more information about Osama bin Laden. They say this guy is now currently living in an underground fortress known as 'Wolf's Hole'. Living in an underground fortress known as 'Wolf's Hole'. What is this guy, Goldfinger?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you're on the run like that and you're living in caves, there's a lot of tension, and a lot of anxiety and a lot of pressure. So Osama and his boys -- when they're on the lam like that, hiding out in caves -- are always looking for stuff to do. So last night, they got together and they watched the Jihad blooper reel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, let's see what's going on with the Afghan thing. I guess you know about this. Our Marines have now established a base inside Afghanistan. They're setting up machine gun placements and they're digging trenches around the perimeter of the base. Well, no, not to fight the Taliban, you know, just to keep out Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's issue of Newsweek magazine, Osama bin Laden recently ordered and received a shipment of gas masks. That's what they said. Well, sure, you spend Thanksgiving weekend in a cave with 20 guys, you're gonna need a gas mask too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's actually worried that bin Laden may commit suicide. Yeah, and the problem is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, the San Francisco airport baggage screeners threatened to stage a sickout. They're protesting the new security bill. They don't like the new security bill. They were going to go to Washington to protest. You know why they called the trip off? They were afraid to fly!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It said in the paper today to avoid getting anthrax -- if you don't want anthrax, people are being warned not to play with diseased livestock. Well, there goes my weekend, pretty much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Massachusetts have used this sophisticated, bioengineering technology to create the first human embryo. They've cloned a human embryo. This is amazing. They took a woman's egg, hollowed out -- what? The nucleus, I guess. Hollowed out the nucleus, scooped out the old DNA, put in new DNA. Maybe I'm wrong, but isn't that also the recipe for deviled eggs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush has come out against this. President Bush says human cloning is morally wrong. And surprising, this is one area where both he and former President Clinton actually agree. They both agree on this. In fact, Clinton said today, he believes humans should be created the old fashioned way, liquored up in a cheap motel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm having a lousy day. Here's what happened. I'm driving to work this morning, and I get pulled over for speeding by a cop. And instead of writing me a ticket, he hands me over to a military tribunal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks now like Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar -- his buddy, his lieutenant -- are living together in a cave somewhere. They're hiding out in a cave together. I don't... I don't think this is going to work, because one of them is...you know, kind of a slob...and the other one is really kind of a neat freak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the number one public relations blunder that this Osama bin Laden made, is he lives in a cave fortress. That's a mistake right there, because if we've learned one thing, it's that you just can't trust a guy who lives in a cave fortress. Dr. No, Lex Luthor, Captain Nemo, Dr. Evil -- I'm telling you, the list goes on.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found a cave in which Osama bin Laden used to live. The Northern Alliance busted in and they found a cave in which he used to live. And it's like full of nothing but boxes of macaroni. And I thought, well, you know, that makes sense, because it's quick, it's easy and some nights you just don't feel like slaying a goat, so it's perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found a lot of boxes of macaroni and several, a lot of, lot of, lot of double-X sized underpants. So, it's macaroni and a lot of really big underpants. I'm telling you, it sounds like Graceland, doesn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists in Massachusetts say they have created the first human embryo. They take the woman's egg, and they treat with a chemical that tricks the egg into thinking it's been fertilized. So basically, it's the oldest guy trick in the world. They get the egg drunk first, you see?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an amazing country. We can clone a human being, but we can't create an airport security system that works.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, up in San Francisco at the airport there, screeners -- baggage screeners threatened to stage a sickout to protest this new security bill. They don't like the requirement. The screeners have to be US citizens. Do you know this? Something like 80% of all aircraft screeners are noncitizens. Do you know what that means? They're taking jobs away from incompetent Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, in some parts of Minnesota, 28 inches of snow with drifts up to seven feet. And today, the Weather Service said the storm was not terrorist-related.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest issue of Newsweek magazine, bin Laden ordered -- Osama bin Laden ordered and received a shipment of gas masks. So basically, Fedex can find this guy. We can't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say some of these Northern Alliance fighters -- they say some of these guys have not bathed or showered in months. Today the French troops said 'Really? We did not notice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you can tell when the Taliban is starting to get desperate, like today they asked us to halt the bombing during Kwanzaa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Ollie North announced he is going to Afghanistan as part of the Fox team. First Geraldo, now Ollie North. This could work. Let's just send all our annoying people to Afghanistan. Let's send Gary Condit over there! Send 'em all over there!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US commander announced today that the marines have established a base. We now have a base in Afghanistan. And the commander said -- this is the commander's exact quote. He said, 'The New York ballet could not have orchestrated a more intricate movement more flawlessly.' Is that the best compliment to give to a group of hard Marines?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. . First Lady Laura Bush, was there to flip the switch on. And 10,000 New Yorkers were there to flip each other off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's tree is a big one. It's 81 feet tall. It's huge. Yeah, yeah. And when she arrived, Laura Bush said, 'I haven't seen that much wood since I met Bob Dole.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is warning journalists not to go into Kandahar because the Taliban might try to use them as hostages. So they're saying don't go. Yeah, and in a related story, the government has asked Geraldo to go to Kandahar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, what a rough crowd we had last night. The entire audience was filled with Federal detainees. The only thing that broke the silence was the sound of sporadic gunfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst selling toy, and you could he guessed this, is 'Tickle Me Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Over in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of the cave and saw his shadow so that means six more weeks of bombing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Taliban are continuing with their brilliant military strategy, the suicide surrender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About a week ago, people reported seeing Osama bin Laden with friends at a restaurant. The single biggest manhunt in the history of the world and this guy is at Red Lobster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found a cave that Osama bin Laden used to occupy. It was full of boxes of macaroni and extra-large pairs of underpants. It's the same thing George Bush found when he moved into the Oval Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to our Transportation Secretary, Norm Mineta, it looks like airlines will not be able to meet the deadline to begin screening all checked luggage for bombs, earlier next year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the airports won't be able to check on all the luggage for bombs, you know what that means -- terrorists will have to be on the honor system. We'll just have to trust them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the FBI announced today they are now looking for Osama bin Laden's financial adviser. You think this guy is in demand? How good a financial adviser can he be? His top client is living in a cave, driving a donkey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is now running the family restaurant in Tennessee. Isn't that unbelievable? The man is this close to being the leader of the free world. Now he's going, 'Hey, you want fries with that?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plans in the works now to restore full trade relations with Vietnam. We'll be selling more and more goods to the people of southeast Asia. In fact, today, George Foreman introduced his new lean, mean cocker spaniel machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary's brother, Hugh Rodham. Remember this guy? He got in a fight. Remember, he beat up a guy, or a guy beat him up? He testified in court this week, he could not recall if he smoked marijuana with the man who allegedly assaulted him, like an hour later. He had no recollection of it. That must have been some pretty good weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would you clone Osama bin Laden? So you can kill him twice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have captured now the number one recruiter for the Al Qaeda terrorist network. This is...in the world of terrorists this guy was like a really big deal the recruiter the guy that came up with the recruiting slogan - 'We're looking for a few mentally deranged lunatics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Osama bin Laden has this impenetrable fortress carved into a mountainside. He's living now like, well, Merv Griffin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the single biggest manhunt in the history.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was fascinating. Court TV is holding a fantasy trial of Osama bin Laden, you know? They got the idea a couple of years ago when Los Angeles held a fantasy trial of O.J. Simpson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now a report that Osama bin Laden has bought 200 gas masks. You know what that means. He's thinking of moving to the Valley.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban calls him [Mullah Omar] the supreme leader. And what a supreme job he's done, huh? His men are either dead, captured or trapped. Imagine if he wasn't the supreme leader, huh? And how about the Chicago Bulls' supreme coach? They've done a hell of a job, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ted Turner denied today rumors that he plans on running for president of the United States. Turner says he will not run for president. He says he doesn't like the White House 'cause it's too small.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, he says too small. He said he would rather spend time on his ranch with his cows than be in the White House. See, that was the great thing about Clinton. He could do both. You see he could spend time with his cows in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Canadian Mint announced they are planning to put out a series of Harry Potter commemorative coins. But the bad news, the Canadian exchange rate, and even with Harry's magic, they're still not worth anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Kev, why did Shaquille O'Neal have himself cloned? So when he misses a free throw he can get the rebound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, Kev, what did Jesse Jackson say when he came out against cloning? What fun is clonin' without the moanin'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Britney Spears said in an interview this week she is still a virgin. You know, we should get a vote. Who do you think's gonna hold out longer -- Osama or Britney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News from Afghanistan: The Taliban is really, really starting to feel the pinch now. They announced earlier today that they were canceling their Christmas party. They just don't feel in the mood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the fighting was in Kandahar. Now, today will be a travel day, then it's back to Kunduz for two more battles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following Osama bin Laden? Fascinating, fascinating guy. He lives in a.what is called like a grim, multileveled underground structure. It's like mall parking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is what I don't understand about this guy. This is the single biggest manhunt in the history of the world. A couple of weeks ago, people see Osama bin Laden having dinner in a restaurant. He's like at the Red Lobster or something. And he's there, he's out there with his buddies, so Osama bin Laden is in a restaurant having dinner with his buddies. And you thought it was dangerous going to a restaurant with Robert Blake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war continues and now the UN is urging both sides to sit down at the peace table, but I don't think ABC and Regis are ready yet for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a very bizarre story. In Afghanistan, US troops are now holding an American man who's been fighting alongside the Taliban. You hear about this guy? He's fighting with the Taliban. He's an American. His mother says he was born in Washington, DC, and his father's a lawyer. Well, that explains it. Probably a terrorist background.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, he surrendered to US Authorities. And he says he wants to go back to his old job -- you know, airline security guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people now criticizing Attorney General John Ashcroft for his policy on what he considers suspicious people. I think he may be going a little overboard. Like, today he arrested the entire band 'Foreigner.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know President Bush runs three miles a day. Three miles a day every day, which.hey, well, big deal. Bin Laden's been running 50 miles a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, one of the tabloids had an interview with a woman who claimed to be Osama bin Laden's ex-wife. She says she's his ex-wife. See, that explains why he used to be a millionaire and lives in a cave and rides a donkey. He's a divorced guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the latest report is that this Mullah Omar guy -- what is this guy? The other -- the supreme leader, whatever. It sounds like a bad burrito, doesn't it? &quot;Come to Afghanistan, get the supreme leader.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, this Mullah Omar guy -- they say his own troops may try to kill him now. Well, duh. I guess they figure with a $25 million reward, they can get all the virgins they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge asked Americans to report any suspicious activity to authorities. You see anything suspicious, you should report it immediately. Like the Detroit Lions making a first down. Anything unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do the Detroit Lions want a clone? So they have someone they could beat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is it easy for scientists to clone Hillary Clinton? The egg's already frozen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of big sales over the holidays. K-Mart, 24-hour sale going on at K- Mart. 24 hours. Sears has some big Christmas sale going on. Taliban having their big going out of business sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this 20-year-old kid named John Walker from northern California? Apparently, fighting for the Taliban. His parents were on the news today. You got to feel sorry. They were pretty upset. But they said, 'Well, thank God, at least he's not playing for the Detroit lions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, that's when you know there's a recession. When that's the only job you can get. 'Okay, Mr. Walker, we have nothing. We do have an opening in Kabul. Okay?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It didn't take long for Hollywood to jump on this John Walker story. See what CBS announced today? They have a new show coming on, 'Walker: Taliban Ranger.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Daily News, in a report from Afghanistan -- I love this. You know we love Geraldo. He's so dramatic. Geraldo Rivera, this is his quote he said today. Geraldo has said, 'He is now carrying a gun, and he will personally shoot Osama bin Laden if he finds him.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Geraldo said he will shoot bin Laden if he finds him. You know, if Osama also has a gun, this could work out okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're asking Americans to report anything unusual or out of the ordinary, which is not easy in LA, okay? What would be unusual in Hollywood? Guy works all day, goes home to his wife?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I turn on the news this morning and they said President Bush closed down a terrorist organization, one that had been collecting millions and millions of dollars from the American people. I said, 'Yes, the IRS is finished!'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in Orlando, yesterday, to help boost tourism in Florida. And while he was there, Vice President Dick Cheney was trying to help boost tourism in an undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story continues to be this 20-year-old kid from northern California, named John Walker. This kid went to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the US. Did you see his mother on the news? She claims her son was brainwashed. Brainwashed? Did you see the kid? I don't think anything has been washed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Walker &quot;looks like Manson after a bad hangover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know what's really ironic? You know the real reason the kid went to Afghanistan? To get away from Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Geraldo is over there now. He says he has a gun. Geraldo says, if he meets bin Laden, he will shoot him. And bin Laden said, 'If I see Geraldo, I'll shoot myself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, over 2,000 Afghanistan tribesmen left for mountains of Tora Bora. That's where bin Laden is supposed to be hiding. They went there in an effort to try and collect the $25 million reward for finding Osama bin Laden. And they're filming it. This is kind of like the Afghanistan version of 'Who wants to be a millionaire?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is something odd. Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant has been able to get his life story sent to England, where it will be published. I don't think we need to read this guy's life story, I think we know how it's going to end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the amazing part -- the guy is living in a cave, but able to mail a package to England during the holidays. I'm standing in line for an hour and a half for a Burbank post office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Strom Thurmond celebrated his 99th birthday today. 99 and still going. It's interesting, when you have six girlfriends who heard he was 99 and still going, they got really depressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to say he's out of it. Today, a reporter asked Strom his opinion of the war and he said, 'Frankly, Robert E. Lee got screwed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy is so old, he needs Viagra to raise his hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Little Rock, Arkansas, former President Bill Clinton broke ground for the Clinton Presidential library. What more appropriate day for Clinton to do this for Wednesday -- hump day, when you think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week in Orlando, Florida, President Bush introduced his new stimulus package.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amazing story. A woman by the name of Lois Ady. You know who she is? She passed away this week at the age of 109.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Senator Strom Thurmond turned 99 years old yesterday. 99 and still working. In fact, he's on the Senate floor and he can't get up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amazing story. A woman by the name of Lois Ady. You know who she is? She passed away this week at the age of 109. If it isn't enough to be 109, this is absolutely true, she was Strom Thurmond's baby sitter. . She remembers changing Strom's diapers, which I guess was Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, before we go any further, urgent announcement -- Mullah Omar, call your office. There's been some changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, good news. You realize the Taliban didn't even last as long as 'Inside Schwartz.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amazing. How about that, huh? We send Geraldo over there. Three days later, they surrender. Boy, good job, Geraldo. Yes, sirree, bob.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Geraldo said on the news the other day that a sniper took a shot at him. Went right by his head. You got to be a bad sniper to miss Geraldo's head. That's a big head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said a sniper took a shot at him. Of course, that could just be one of the Taliban soldiers trying to kiss up to the Marines before they surrender. 'Hey, come on, I tried to shoot Geraldo.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess the Northern Alliance forces now have control of the Kandahar airport, which is -- here's my question -- what do security guards think about suspicious behavior in that airport? Hey, a guy in a business suit with no beard and no gun. Pull him over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite story. According to the London newspaper 'The Sun,' Osama bin Laden now has ordered his wives and the wives of all his supporters to pick up guns and fight the Americans. Well, there's a cause the women of Afghanistan can really get behind. Yeah! 'Five more years of slavery. Come on, girls!&quot;We like not talking for six years.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the lawyer for John Walker, you know, the kid that turned into Taliban Walker Ranger, whatever he is. John Walker, Taliban Ranger. The lawyer for this kid spoke up today. He now says his client was not really a religious fanatic when he joined the Taliban. The only reason he joined, he figured it was, you know, what are the chances of meeting 72 virgins in America? You know, it's something -- it's not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, what's fascinating to me. If you watch the local news here in Los Angeles, you wouldn't think there was a war going on at all. You know what the lead story was today here at 4:30 on the news? 'Is your car ready for winter?&quot;Will you be stranded? How to prepare, today at 4:30.' Huh, prepare? Oh, yeah, those 85-degree temperatures can be brutal on cars. Whoo! Especially if you're stuck with one of those older '90s models. Oh, my god. You don't have that thing set on max cool, it could get very warm in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, in Little Rock, Arkansas, they began groundbreaking for the Bill Clinton presidential library. They say the library itself -- boy, this is going to be a magnificent structure. Really something. In fact, I understand Clinton is staining the wood himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this teachers' strike on the East Coast keeping something like 10,000 students out of school. What a great time to be a kid, huh? Now that the school gives you free condoms, you don't have to go anymore. Yeah! 'Here's a condom. Go home and use it.' Perfect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how bad Detroit's offense is, Dick Cheney now considers their end zone to be a secure and undisclosed location.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The winner [of the loser of the week] had to be this man, ladies and gentlemen. This man, John Walker, 20-year-old American decided he had enough of freedom, prosperity, didn't want any more running water, went to Afghanistan to join those fun group of guys known as the Taliban. Congratulations, John Walker, loser of the week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That CNN -- CNN is arranging to interview Osama bin Laden. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Yeah, apparently, bin Laden says he trusts CNN, because Larry King's the only man who's had more wives than he's had.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban fulfilled their promise to fight to the finish. They're finished!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden has reportedly ordered his wives to fight for him. Oh, yeah. That will work. Maybe they'll fetch him a beer, too.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something. Giving a woman a gun around bin Laden, you don't have to worry about finding him. Burying him, maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to one of Osama's wives, rather than having Americans capture him bin Laden plans on having two of his sons shoot him. . I believe his sons are Erik and Lyle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldo Rivera sent in a report over the weekend. Thank god he's there. Geraldo said, his next step, to down go into the underground caves and find bin Laden himself. This could work. Find the cave where bin Laden is hiding, send in Geraldo, and we seal up the cave! Two birds with one stone!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More news coming about this American named John Walker. . Turns out he went to a terrorist school in Afghanistan or as we call it over here, pre-law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Vice President Dick Cheney said on 'Meet The Press' Sunday that he would like to run again in 2004. In fact, he's already looking for an undisclosed location for his campaign headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taliban leader Mullah Omar is on the run in Afghanistan with a handful of his bodyguards-- have you heard about this-- they're making a movie about this, it's called 'Omar's 11.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say now that Mullah Omar is living out of his car. You know things are not going well for the Jihad when your supreme leader is living in his Toyota. That's a bad sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got this California guy, have you heard about this, fighting for the Taliban? It's just unbelievable. They capture the guy, and now apparently he's very depressed because he had his heart set on a career as a suicide bomber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He moved from California to Afghanistan. I want to tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, that is the worst decision since I decided to leave NBC and come to CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Osama bin Laden now, they say he's had plastic surgery. They say he sneaked across the border into Pakistan and had plastic surgery, which by the way is the place to go for plastic surgery. . And he looks great. He looks fantastic. Now, a tourist came up to him earlier this week and said, 'Could I have your autograph, Mr. Hasselhoff?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw a stupid product in a Christmas catalog. This is a real product. You know, people want to be patriotic and it's very nice but, this inventor has come out with a patriotic toilet seat that plays the Star Spangled Banner when you sit on it. Forget the obvious bad taste, is that really a good idea? When you hear the Star Spangled Banner what are you supposed to do? You're supposed to stand up. So you sit down -- and every time -- you know, how do you -- it defeats its own purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Geraldo Rivera is over there in Afghanistan, reporting for us every single day. While we are sitting here in our beds, he is reporting. He says he has video of a sniper firing a shot just an inch above his head. Just an inch above his head. And today, the American government sent him something to help out. A pair of elevator shoes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got this cold. A little bit of a cold. But we're plowing through. If a cold gets me, you know what that means? The terrorists have won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems Osama bin Laden now, determined not to be taken alive. He's told his own men to kill him if US troops are closing in. You know, with that $25 million reward, you think this may have already crossed their minds? 'Oh, we're way ahead of you boss. Yeah. In fact, I think I see somebody coming now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here at home, the Fed cut interest rates another quarter point today. It's the 11th time this year they cut the interest rate. It's the 11th time they cut it. Apparently someone forgot to tell Visa and American Express.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And California Congressman Gary Condit has officially declared he's running for reelection. You know what that means, he's ready to start dating again, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to have some problems because the Democratic Party wants nothing to do with him. He's been completely abandoned by the Democratic Party. They don't want to help him, not gonna help him raise money. They don't want him in the party. Imagine that? You're being abandoned by the party that stood behind Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, Bill Clinton. This is like getting kicked out of Sodom and Gomorrah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some political pundits say that Condit may actually do okay in this political climate. They say that now Osama bin Laden is in the news all of the time, Condit doesn't look so bad. Well that's a great slogan, huh? 'Condit, not as bad as bin Laden.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan, Geraldo Rivera was fired at by a sniper while he was on camera. This guy fired at him. Yeah. Yeah, afterwards, Geraldo bragged, 'See? I get recognized wherever I go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leader of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar is living in a Toyota.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The supreme leader of the Taliban, and he's living a Toyota. But he believes when he dies he will get a Lincoln town car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can tell it's Mullah Mohammed Omar's Toyota because he has a bumper sticker that reads, 'I would rather be jihading.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Osama bin Laden, boy what a strange bird this guy is. They now think that he sneaked to Pakistan to get a facelift. Same place Faye Dunaway goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Osama bin Laden wasn't too happy. He had to go at night to get his facelift in Pakistan, and when you go to Pakistan at night you get an American doctor. He wasn't very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are reports that Osama bin Laden would like to commit suicide on television. I'll tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, this is the kind of lead in I have been praying forever since I came to CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden is planning a televised suicide, or as I call it, hosting the Academy Awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the allied forces told the Taliban to 'surrender or die.' Surrender or die. Wasn't that one of OJ's old pickup lines?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that controversial tape of Osama bin Laden gonna be broadcast this week. And the word is, now they're bringing in the FBI. You know why? I guess the tape was not rewound when they found it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest word is, Osama bin Laden is now believed to be in Pakistan. They think he's been in Pakistan for the past ten days. Why is it every time Geraldo goes looking for something, it's not there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more details coming out on John Walker. That's the kid that fought for the Taliban, the American kid. In fact, when he was captured, he had long, unwashed hair, he was wearing a tattered old sweater and a filthy pair of tennis shoes. At first, they thought they'd captured Nick Nolte.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit has given his first interview in months. He spoke to the LA Times the other day. He announced his wife supports him 100%. So apparently, Walker's not the only northern Californian who's been brainwashed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit said, 'People know I come home every weekend.' So he's faithful on the weekends. So I think that's a start. That's a start.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Geraldo Rivera said that he'll kill Osama bin Laden if he gets the chance. That's what he said. He said he'll kill Osama bin Laden if he gets the chance.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is interesting political news. House Majority Leader Dick Armey announced today that he's retiring after 17 years in the House of Representatives. Yeah, actually, I don't have a joke about this. I just like to say 'Dick Armey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Osama bin Laden is no longer able to communicate with his agents. Ladies and gentlemen, I have had the same problem for 20 years. I have had the same damn problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Osama bin Laden, who is a good looking guy to begin with.he goes over to Pakistan to have some plastic surgery. He has a full face-lift.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the plastic surgery has improved bin Laden's looks. He's unbelievably attractive now. Last night, he's so good looking, he actually went out and got bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top Ten Excuses Of The American Taliban Guy: 10. Terrorist training camps looked a lot nicer in the brochure. 9. I didn't join the Taliban, I was interning for the Taliban. 8. I lost a Super Bowl bet. 7. Dazzled by the Taliban commercials that aired during one of Kathie Lee's Ramadan specials. 6. What kid doesn't grow up dreaming of being the next Mullah Omar? 5. Al Qaeda? Oh man, I thought I was fighting for Ralph Nader. 4. Since when is fighting against your country with an evil terrorist regime considered treason? 3. Got tired of wearing clean clothes and not getting shot at. 2. Like you've never joined an international terrorist ring. 1. Oh, I thought this was a paintball game.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration released the Osama bin Laden videotape today. You see that thing? Man. We only had the tape for three days and then we have to return it to the Kabul Blockbuster.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is pretty good evidence against him. In fact, it's so good, even prosecutors in LA think they could get a conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has an even more damaging bin Laden video that they're going to release. Apparently, in this one, Osama claims, 'Look, I was drunk, the donkey came on to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Christian Science Monitor is now reporting that friends of Osama say he left Afghanistan ten days ago and is currently in Pakistan.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They keep saying we have to rebuild Afghanistan. When was it built in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That American kid who joined the Taliban, Johnny Walker. That's his name, Johnny Walker. He's currently being held in a place called Camp Rhino. Camp Rhino? Isn't that where Clinton used to take his girlfriends?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This John Walker kid went to a terrorist school in Afghanistan. A terrorist school. How many fingers is that shop class teacher missing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine going to a terrorist school. No music. No women, a bunch of guys that need a bath, huh? How sucky is that prom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oliver North said he's very upset that John Walker could come back to this country and cash in on his celebrity status. Yeah. You hate to see someone who did something wrong get rewarded by writing a book or getting a TV show out of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain is being hit with a $100 million lawsuit, accusing them of discriminating against black customers. Now, I don't know if this story is a mistake, but when someone accuses you of racial discrimination, it doesn't help much if your restaurant is called 'The Cracker Barrel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, the White House released the infamous Osama bin Laden video. You've probably all seen this thing. Yeah, and the weird thing is, it's hosted by Bob Saget.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, the government released that videotape of Osama bin Laden, I'm sure you all saw it. If you watch, you know, Osama's not only ruthless and evil, but really, really boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And could he be more guilty? Even O.J.'s going, 'Come on, you know he did it. What are you doing? Look at that.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And who's that other guy? Who's that other guy? You see the other guy in the tape? Who's the other Smith brother sitting there with him? That guy. Get some furniture. Go to Ikea. Come on. Where do they live? I think they identified the man today as 'sheik kiss ass,' I believe his name was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, you know, we still have our $25 million bounty. We're still offering $25 million bucks for bin Laden, but nobody's turned him in yet. Do you think it's like our lottery over there? You know what I'm saying? I mean, you think there's a guy living in a cave with a goat going, 'I'm not going to look until it's $30 million. I'm not getting out of the cave for $25 million.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, Kevin, I want to remind you, the Kwanzaa party tomorrow night at the Cracker Barrel has been canceled. . The big Kwanzaa party at the Cracker Barrel. That's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who don't know, the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain was hit with a $100 million discrimination suit for discriminating against African- Americans. There's this big suit. Today, Cracker Barrel said perhaps the name of the company is insensitive. They've now changed it to the Redneck Barrel. Apparently it's not the Cracker Barrel anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cracker Barrel restaurants are being sued by a group of black customers who claim they were discriminated against. They're suing 'em. Yeah, and they actually may be right. 'Cause the restaurant's new slogan is 'We Put The Cracker Back In Cracker Barrel.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today -- and this has been, I guess, a big complaint -- a lot of travelers have been complaining about being patted down by security guards at airports. They say it's really excessive. And it's really a problem. And, folks, in a related story, Richard Simmons says he flies five or six times a day. 'You missed a spot right here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all very excited, very proud, right here on CBS, Sunday night, two- hour holiday show right here Sunday night. It's Garth Brooks live from Tora Bora, so if you can't... Make a note of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you folks see the Osama bin Laden videotape that they released? It's unbelievable, isn't it? It's crazy and very incriminating. If you watch the tape, if you see the whole thing, in watching the tape, you realize that he's plotting to knock off three Las Vegas casinos. Crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tape is in a restaurant and it's I guess a popular chain restaurant in Afghanistan, thank Allah it's Friday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's Osama bin Laden, the greatest man in the history of the world, and Osama bin Laden's in a restaurant with his buddies. Well, you can't blame him, get out of the cave every now and then, you know? You can't be locked up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they say now that Osama bin Laden slipped into Pakistan and had plastic surgery. In fact, he is using his old nose as a two-car garage. It's true. After the surgery, Osama looks so great, whenever he's out walking around, people scream, 'Hey, hey, we loved you on American Bandstand,' he looks so great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But apparently bin Laden's mother says that she is not angry with her son, just deeply disappointed... No, wait a minute. That's what my mom says. Forget that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Northern Alliance, they have captured the Mullah Omar's palace in Kandahar. Have you heard about this? It's a crazy place. Pink tiled bathroom where the guy lived, crystal chandeliers, gold faucets, marble tile and of course his mission in life was to destroy American decadence. That was his mission in life. It makes a lot of sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many have seen that Osama bin Laden footage? Have you seen that thing? Pretty scary. Pretty scary. In fact, today, NBC ordered 13 more episodes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Army said today they're now considering offers to build a 30,000- pound bomb to drop on these terrorists. 30,000-pound bomb. I mean, it wouldn't even have to go off, would it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Pentagon said today they are now reviewing their 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. Well, how do you investigate a policy where you can't ask anything and nobody can tell you anything?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, it turns out there are still traces of anthrax in the Senate office building. Boy, wouldn't it be ironic if after all these years of living with Bill, Hillary winds up catching something from the Senate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's a strange story. It seems emergency crews were called to the Toronto airport after a horse -- a horse -- went berserk on a 747 that had 230 passengers on it. See, I said this from the beginning -- yeah, we should have Sky Marshals on board, but don't let them ride their horses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the horse went berserk, they questioned some of the airport security people about the animal, and they said, 'Horse? What horse?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In San Diego the other day, an American Airlines flight was delayed for three hours after a woman was arrested after a fake hand grenade fell out of her carry-on bag, it rolled down the aisle. Did you hear this story? She had a thing -- obviously it was a fake hand grenade. And the head of airport security said, 'Well, it looked like an apple on the scanner.' Yeah, an apple with a pin in it and a handle on the side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain.they've been hit with $100 million lawsuit for discriminating against African-Americans. So it sounds like they have the crackers over a barrel, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the day I ordered my gift for Mom. I'm fearful that I made a mistake. . I wanted to get her one of those weed whackers, but I think I got the number wrong. I may have sent her a daisy cutter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the Osama bin Laden dinner party tape? . He's having dinner with a legless sheik. We can't even catch that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that Osama bin Laden sneaked over to Pakistan for plastic surgery. . Now, he's passing himself of as Jeff Goldblum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Friday, they heard Osama bin Laden on the radio. Apparently he has a radio show. Here's how it works. Every morning he is on the radio and he tries to talk hot chicks into taking off their burkhas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite news story. Allen Dershowitz -- remember him? One of the OJ dream team lawyers with Shapiro and Cochran. He says the video of Osama bin Laden is not enough to convict him of terrorism. Dershowitz says bin Laden just repeats information he heard on the news. See, let me tell you something. This is why we should never put this John Walker kid, this Taliban kid, on trial here in America, 'cause he'll get Dershowitz as a lawyer, he'll accuse the Marines of planting a machine gun, they'll confuse the jury, and you'll see Walker playing golf in Florida telling reporters, 'Yeah, I'm out looking for the real terrorists.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to Men's Health magazine this month, one of the worst things that a woman can say about a man is that he is a lying, cheating jerk. Oh, yeah, that really hurt Bill Clinton's career, didn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his latest report from Afghanistan, Geraldo Rivera says that Osama bin Laden is hiding out in Pakistan. That's what he said. Which means that the most hated man in Afghanistan is now Geraldo Rivera.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Northern Alliance now saying they know exactly where Mullah Mohammed Omar is, and what that means, of course, is they have no idea where he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports, Mullah Mohammed Omar has retreated to a mountain cave near Bagram and is ready to fight to the death.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the big news is Osama bin Laden has shaved his beard. No longer has a beard. He's passing himself off as Alex Trebek.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest report is Osama bin Laden has shaved his beard, is wearing western clothes and has even gotten plastic surgery. Isn't that amazing? The guy makes just two videos and he's gone Hollywood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Show you what a hypocrite Osama bin Laden is. When he got the plastic surgery, he demanded a Jewish doctor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bin Laden also says he is willing to be a martyr for his cause. You know, except the last part where you have to die. Yeah, yeah. Luckily, he has people to do that for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, Geraldo Rivera. Looks like our buddy Geraldo involved in some more controversy. It seems that while in Afghanistan, he may have lied a little bit.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Defense Department -- this is the most recent news -- says the troops in Afghanistan have discovered several more tapes of Osama bin Laden speaking with his followers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three months, 12,000 pounds of bombs, billions and billions of dollars, and the highest ranking enemy we have captured so far is an American. Does that seem about right?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you heard this but they say now Osama bin Laden and his buddy Mullah Omar have left Afghanistan disguised as women. They are dressed up as women and they went across the Pakistan border. They are going make a movie about it, and I think the title will be 'Some Like it Jihad!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're pretty sure bin Laden has been disguised as a woman. And twice he has been mistaken for Janet Reno.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my question, okay? If I got on a plane, and there's a terrorist on board, do I get my $10 back?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still no word from Osama bin Laden. Nobody's heard from this guy. Did you see that last video? Man, he looked near death, didn't he? Very frail, very gaunt. Did he look like he was ready for 72 virgins? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The airlines can't catch a break. Bad PR. A San Jose woman was kicked off a cross-country flight for having a crying baby, and they kicked her off the plane.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they made her leave just for that. What kind of priorities? They let -- security lets on guns, knives, people with bombs in their shoe, but a crying baby they kick off the plane. What did the baby do, wake up the security guard?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A National Guard specialist working airport security at San Francisco airport accidentally shot himself in the ass while on the job. He took his gun out -- bang -- shot himself. Thank God he's okay, but he shoots himself in the ass and he's a specialist. What are the untrained people doing? Oh, my God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police described him as armed and clueless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, even God is trying to get bin Laden now. 'Look, I've had enough, I'm fed up with you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other big story out of Afghanistan is that officials over there now believe that this Mullah Omar guy, and Osama bin Laden are now living and traveling together. That will free up 144 virgins, right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, we've gone from 'Operation Enduring Freedom' to Operation 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Argentina, what's going on down there? They've chosen their fifth president in two weeks. Here is the amazing part, Florida is not even involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new law went into effect in California this week, hard to believe it took this long, it is now illegal to smoke on school playgrounds. Oh, great. What are kids to supposed to do after having sex with the teacher now? Can't light up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, New York City's new Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said that he plans -- listen to this -- he plans on taking the subway to work every day. That's what he's going to do. Take the subway to work. Yeah, Bloomberg also said he plans on showing up late for work and smelling like urine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Detroit Free Press.the city's new mayor there has declared Detroit to be 'God's city.' Detroit is God's city. Yeah, and in a related story, God announced that he's moving to the suburbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Freak snow storms all over the South. Airports were shut down down South today. Atlanta's airport was so empty, security guards were forced to fondle and grope each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, our crack airport security team, they're doing their job. You hear about this guy in San Francisco? Security guard?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest reports are that former leader, Mullah Omar, and Osama bin Laden are now living together. I mean, we knew the Taliban hated women, I guess now we know why.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've had five presidents in two weeks. I think the last guy got the job by being the tenth caller, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to a recent study -- attractive lawyers make 14% more money that unattractive lawyers. Well, that makes sense. If you're going to get screwed, you want it to be by somebody attractive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And PETA, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, has donated 40 mink coats to the homeless. You know, these mink coats were donated to them. People didn't want to wear mink anymore. PETA then gave them to the homeless to wear. Which is very nice. But isn't it going to be tough for the homeless when they ask for money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pentagon officials said that they believe that Osama bin Laden is still in hiding, and they expect him to release more disturbing videos. That's what they said. Yeah, then they said the same thing about Mariah Carey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'The Salt Lake Tribune'.local police have received dozens of calls from people claiming to have spotted Osama bin Laden in Utah. Yeah, and when asked to comment, Osama denied he would go to Utah, because the Mormon religion is too strict.&quot;</SPAN></P>

He announced that he would like to cut pay for both the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department. I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, this guy is a public relations genius, isn't he?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News from Afghanistan. They're taking those Taliban POWs and they're going to put them in a prisoner camp in Cuba. We really know how to punish these terrorists, don't we? Make them spend the winter in the Caribbean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think now that Mullah Omar took a hike on a motorcycle. . So we have a one-eyed Mullah on a Harley Davidson, and we can't even find this guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Pentagon thinks that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive. This guy has survived more bombs than CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some sad news. You probably heard about this over the weekend. President Clinton's dog Buddy, yeah, he's dead. . It's a heartbreaking thing because Buddy was a great dog. Buddy could roll over, Buddy would beg, buddy could catch things in his mouth and...wait a minute. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm thinking of Monica.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had quite a scare over the weekend -- Bush was watching TV, munching on some pretzels, when he choked on one of them and fainted. Isn't that scary? All of this time worried about Osama bin Laden, turns out he was almost done in by Mr. Salty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minute Bush passed out, you know, they ran to get Dick Cheney and then they realized no one could remember the undisclosed location he was hiding in.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, former President Clinton's dog, Buddy got run over by a car recently. That was very sad. And Hillary said today she feels terrible because she was aiming at Bill, she didn't even realize.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news and bad news about the airline industry. The good news, planes are full. They are packed. That's good. The bad news, they're filled with al Qaeda prisoners going to Cuba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess today, more al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners were flown to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and on the plane, they are sedated, they are drugged, their feet bound, chained to the chair, or as Continental calls it, coach, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And starting next month, airline passengers will have to pay $10 extra for increased security. You get a lot of security for ten bucks. So they kind of frisk you for a little bit longer. It's ten bucks to be felt and rubbed by a stranger, basically. Still a better deal than Hollywood Boulevard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had a check-up and my heart is running as smoothly as an Enron document shredder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just about now, a military tribunal is convicting a pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in the White House, President George W. Bush was watching a football game and eating pretzels. He got it wedged in his throat or something and the poor guy blacked out and hit the ground. He was out for like four seconds. Fortunately, it was the four seconds that Dick Cheney was conscious yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is making jokes about President Bush choking on a pretzel, but I want to say something in his defense. It was one of those twisty kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge issued and all-points- bulletin for Mr. Salty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is no laughing matter, Bush had a cut on his forehead and his cheek was bruised. And this President isn't even married to Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, of course, is not the first choking episode at the White House. The last time, the President actually got caught in someone else's throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For you folks at home, please, put the pretzels down. It's not worth it! You have too much to live for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this story. I guess you know, over the weekend, President Bush passed out when he began choking on a pretzel. Hey, still better than the old days, remember he used to choke on vowels?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, the White House, though, they're taking this serious. They're not taking any chances. From now on, a Secret Service agent will pre- chew all pretzels before -- and then hand them to the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out he was choking while watching the playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and the Baltimore Ravens, which is amazing because the Dolphins were choking at the exact same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess what happened was, Bush passed out, banged his head on the table, then came to a little while later. In fact, Bush said today it was just like being back in college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He got banged up. You see that big bruise? Black eyes, he looked like one of Mike Tyson's dates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quick question, how many people are here because the show is free and you lost all your life savings on Enron?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, officials now say there's not a shred of evidence they did anything wrong. Of course not, they shredded all the evidence, that's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I love. Two Cabinet members today are now claiming they never even told President Bush what was going on. They said he was completely unaware of the entire situation. You know, I got to feel sorry for Bush's political advisers. For the last year, they've been telling us, 'He's smart, he's in charge, he knows what's going on.' Then, when we finally start to believe them, they go, 'Nah, he was out of the loop. He didn't know anything.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton broke a new record last night. He was here in Los Angeles, where he gave a speech where he's paid $200,000 for one speech. It is the highest price ever paid for one speech. $200,000. Nice to see a brother from Harlem finally making it big.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amnesty International now says it is concerned about the harsh living conditions of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners being held in Cuba. Harsh -- huh? These people used to live in caves. They're in the Caribbean in January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, security at the prison is very high, and that's just to keep the locals from breaking in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And starting next week, airline passengers will have to pay a $10 fee to help maintain airport security and also there will be a first class service as well. For $15, the guard will warm his hands over an electric heater before he pats you down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the Bush Administration says it wants to restore food stamps to all immigrants who are here legally. I say, why not, huh? How much can it cost to feed what, half a dozen people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, coming to work today, I saw one of those only in New York scenes. It can only happen in New York City. A rat who had passed out...after he swallowed a pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier on CBS they debuted a brand-new television series called First Monday, how many of you had a chance to see First Monday? . It's all about the behind the scenes action and excitement of the Supreme Court. Hang on to your hats. The first episode tonight, they decided the next presidential election by flipping a coin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They moved the Taliban, some of the Taliban prisoners now in Cuba, and listen to this. They get a bath towel...the prisoners get shampoo, toothpaste. And Cubans down there are going to Fidel Castro saying, 'Wait a minute, why can't we get this stuff?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard this before I came out here to do the show, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay apparently just slipped over the border into Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Bush's Cabinet told him that they had nothing do with helping Enron, and Bush had trouble swallowing that as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An awful thing about Bush and the pretzel, you know that's no laughing matter. And they did a background check on the pretzel...and found out at one time he went to Germany on a secret trip and traveled to Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the same thing happened to Ted Kennedy one time. He got beer nuts lodged into his throat...and passed out on a waitress at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is my favorite thing about this, I'm not making this up. Earlier today, I'm watching MSNBC and they called President Bush's dogs heroes because the dogs stood there and guarded him after he passed out from choking on the pretzels. Oh, shut up! These dogs are not heroes. Okay? You know, they're just waiting there to see how long he was going to lie there before they stole the pretzel and starting eating it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are taking this whole incident pretty seriously. In fact, workers at the White House spent all day childproofing the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House doctors today have made sure that the pretzel incident doesn't happen again. You got that? This is the only thing they're going to be serving now. New Gerber strained pretzels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I was thinking, if Al Gore had been elected president it wouldn't have happened. Al Gore never has a problem with food. You wouldn't see Al Gore choking on a pretzel. . A ham hock, maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, US forces destroyed a large Al Qaeda training camp. Now people in Detroit are asking, 'While you're at it, could you destroy the Lions training camp too? Is that possible?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, more Al Qaeda prisoners were airlifted to that Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba today. And one of the terrorists had to be sedated because he was afraid to fly. Afraid to fly. Who's fault is that? Duh! Oh, really? What are you scared of?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guards at the Navy Base.shaved off all of the prisoners hair and beards, our guys, the army guys, shaved the prisoners hair and beards because they're all infested with lice. And now the American Muslim council, protesting, saying the treatment is humiliating to the men. Apparently, it's okay to take away a woman's civil rights and beat her with a stick, but god forbid, you give a guy a shave and a haircut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Cochran &quot;said he would not defend Osama bin Laden if he had the chance. And he listed all of the problems he had with the case. He said he feels like a victim himself. He says he is too emotionally tied to case and he doesn't think he could give it his best effort. Notice the fact he didn't mention that Osama bin Laden is guilty. That part didn't bother him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Afghanistan, this is the big story today, a former financial officer of the Taliban has turned himself in to American forces. They say he's an expert on complicated illegal transfers of huge amounts of money. In fact, before the Taliban, this guy used to work for Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange had suspended trading of Enron stock. They suspended it? Why? Are people lining up to buy it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they keep talking about this former head of Enron, Kenneth Lay. Kenneth Lay. Mr. Lay. Wasn't that Clinton's Secret Service name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night, former President Clinton was right here in Los Angeles, gave a speech, got a record $200, speech. Isn't that amazing? $200,000 for a speech. And the thing about Clinton, is you know he got even more under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration now says it wants to restore food stamps to all immigrants who are here legally. A legal immigrant. And you thought it was hard finding Osama bin Laden. Yeah. Good luck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC had a new game show on last night, called 'The Chair.' Did anybody watch this? The way it works is, you sit in this chair and get asked all these tough questions while they monitor your heart rate, which sounds more like a Dick Cheney press conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, we had trouble with the audience last night. I told a joke and it triggered their vagus nerve and everybody fainted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People &quot;always come up to me and they say the same thing. They say, 'Why do you do this night after night after night?' I'll be honest with you. In all honesty, I don't want to do this night after night after night. I have to do this night after night. My accountant is Arthur Andersen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been following the big Enron scandal? According to the insiders, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay has sold all of his stock. In fact, the only thing the he owns now is the Bush Administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They moved the Taliban prisoners to Cuba and all the Taliban prisoners in Cuba, they got soap, they got a towel, a lovely shampoo and conditioner all in one. I'm thinking, we should try that on the subway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the American Taliban guy, John Walker. They say now that he actually met Osama bin Laden and got a personal thank you from Osama bin Laden for participating in jihad. And John Walker also received the staff jacket and a bottle of champagne from Osama bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has recovered from the pretzel choking episode. I'm telling you, I never thought I would hear the phrase White House and gag reflex in the same sentence again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen pictures of President Bush after he hit the deck when the pretzel caused him to go down that like. He's got that big red thing. It turns out it's rug burn he got rug burn on his face. A rug burn. Didn't Monica get those on her knees?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, tonight, tonight at exactly 12:01 tonight the new airline regulations take effect. Well, they got this new rule, bag matching. It requires that the plane cannot take off unless all of the luggage on board matches all the passengers on board. That is going to be a nightmare, isn't it? Huh? How many passengers haven't been sent to the same place as their luggage?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about matching the in-flight meal to some sort of animal. All right, can you do that?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll tell you, these new measures are pretty tough. In fact, Michigan Congressman John Dingell, he was forced to strip down to his underwear because his artificial hip, I guess he got a metal rod or something, artificial hip kept setting off the metal detector. When I heard there was a Congressman in the airport in his underpants, I thought it was Gary Condit campaigning for reelection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the New York Post, earlier this week, Bill Clinton changed his travel plans when he found out that he and Monica Lewinsky would be flying out of New York City on the same day on the same airline on the same flight. He changed. It would have been a rough day for Monica -- first you get groped and fondled by the airport security and then again by Clinton. It's too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's back. She is back in the news again, Monica Lewinsky. She's out here in Los Angeles, on a nationwide tour promoting a new HBO documentary about her life. There is somebody you'll never see choking on a pretzel, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And she said today on the news, the biggest misconception, the biggest misconception about her is that she is a publicity hound that got involved with President Clinton just so she could become a big celebrity. Who would have thought that performing oral sex on the president of the US then talking to Barbara Walters about it, and writing a book about it and then doing a movie about it would make you famous? Who would think?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also told reporters today that she is sick and tired of her name, Lewinsky, being associated with a sex act. Today, B.J. Thomas said, 'Tell me about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She also said at the press conference, 'I am not the only one in the world who has done that.' True. I think she's the only one who saved the evidence for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, President Bush named a new surgeon general, Dr. Heimlich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a whole theory on this pretzel story with Bush. See, if Bush had still been drinking he could have washed the pretzel down with beer and saved his own life. That's the trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All kinds of theories on this pretzel choking incident. They had a doctor on TV today, and he said the reason this happened to President Bush is that Bush has lower than average blood pressure. Lower than average. Now, I like President Bush. You know, with all due respect, but can't this guy ace one test in his life? All his numbers are lower than average -- SATs, grade point, now it's blood pressure too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interim government of Afghanistan said today that that country needs $15 billion to rebuild, $15 billion. Apparently they're using the same guys that did my kitchen. Same contractor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some human rights groups are complaining that the Al Qaeda detainees in Guantanamo Bay are being treated inhumanely. Oh, please. They're in the Caribbean in January. Okay? You know, if you added some goats and sheep to the place they would think it was 'Temptation Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the American Department of Agriculture, Americans are eating four times as much Mexican food as they did 20 years ago. Of course we are, we have four times as many Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry I'm a little late coming out. I have been upstairs in my office all day shredding financial documents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well the manhunt continues for the elusive evil mastermind, but I'm telling you, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is still at large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's going on down in Cuba? They took the Taliban prisoners out of Afghanistan and flew them down to Cuba, and now they're down there. And each Taliban prisoner, to sleep on, they have a foam rubber mat and a bucket. You think about that. A foam rubber mat and bucket. In New York City, that would cost you $2,000 a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to wonder, how tough is this prison? I mean, you're lying around on a foam rubber mat in the Caribbean all day. I mean, how bad is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this one, one of Osama bin Laden's relatives started his own clothing line? It's a line of fashion wear. I believe it's Osama bin Laden's brother, Tommy bin Laden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you heard about the Monica Lewinsky show on HBO? I have not seen it yet, but I heard it's getting very good word of mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know the new airline rules requiring bag matching started today. It's crazy now. What's the new thing, a plane cannot take off unless all of the bags on board match the passengers on board. It's even tougher for flights here in L.A. If you're from Beverly Hills your bags must also match your shoes and your purse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it is unbelievable now, security is so tight, guards are even fondling and groping unattractive passengers.&quot;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And airlines are also bringing in a lot more of these bomb-sniffing dogs, which are considered to be the most intelligent dogs in the world. You know what we should do? Send a couple of these dogs to the White House. The next time Bush chokes on the pretzel, maybe these dogs will do something instead of sitting there, like those two idiot dogs that Bush had.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the idiot shoe-bomber guy, Richard Reid, pleaded not guilty. Not guilty! How can -- 200 people see you try to light your foot on fire. How can you be not guilty? Not guilty, where does he think he is, Los Angeles?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other idiot, the American Taliban kid, John Walker, the captured kid, he has waived his right to an attorney. Says he doesn't want a lawyer, he doesn't trust lawyers. Pretty sad, isn't it? I mean, people who trust Osama bin Laden won't trust a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another group of al Qaeda prisoners has been delivered to Guantanamo Bay there in Cuba. Officials say the living conditions for the prisoners will be humane but not comfortable. Which I think is Motel 6's slogan, isn't it? Humane but not comfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More complaints about our alleged inhumane treatment of these Taliban prisons in Cuba. It seems the food we gave them was too salty and now their throats are becoming swollen and a lot of them are not able to yell, 'Death to America!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is an odd story. The 'Wall Street Journal' reporting Osama bin Laden's brother is coming out with his own line of bin Laden clothes. Well, there you go, huh? Who would buy bin Laden clothes? . The only garment I want to see with the name bin Laden is a body bag, maybe the little tag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department has released videotape of five suspected Al Qaeda operatives who, the government says, are ready to die for the Al Qaeda network -- which works out great for us, 'cause, hey, we're ready to kill them. We're on the same page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the interim government of Afghanistan says they need $15 billion to rebuild, $15 billion. Today Kmart said, 'Hey, join the club, okay? You're not the only ones.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Afghanistan now says it needs $15 billion immediately -- immediately! If we don't give it to them, military experts feel there will be nothing left to bomb the next time around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Enron thing getting ugly down there in Washington. Ooh, boy. Gone from 'Operation Enduring Freedom' to 'Operation Cover Your Ass.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see that new show on the Food Channel? 'Cooking the Books' with the Arthur Anderson accounting firm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chairman of Enron, Kenneth Lay, or Kenneth Screw, as he should be called, he's trying to sell three of the four $15 million properties he owns in Aspen, Colorado. You know, why not let the employees whose life savings got wiped out, let them live there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was one year ago yesterday that Bush took office, which -- isn't that amazing? Just think, a year ago, Bush was considered dumb and the president of Enron was a genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, President Bush is fine, fine, almost a week later, after waking up.on the floor next to his dog when he choked on a pretzel. In a related story, the President of South Korea woke up next to a bag of pretzels after choking on a dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me tell you something, we make fun, but this a real tribute to President Bush. The fact that Americans believed this, a pretzel knocked me unconscious story. I mean, most people believe it, he choked on a pretzel. Think about this. Imagine that was Clinton, Clinton shows up, he's got a bruise, a mark here, 'I choked on a pretzel.' Shut up! You didn't choke on a pretzel. You believe Clinton choked on a pretzel? You know what really happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the name of the brand of the pretzel Bush choked on? Anybody know? Nobody knows. It's not being revealed. They will not tell us the name of the brand. Don't you love our priorities? We keep the pretzel brand -- oh, that's classified. You can't find out. They won't tell you. Meanwhile, our top military secrets are on CNN every day of the week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Monica Lewinsky is doing a documentary for HBO about her affair with the President. HBO? Didn't Clinton use to refer to her as Showtime? No, she is, she's doing this documentary and I think it's going to be called 'Black Pants Down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our ol' buddy Pat Buchanan is at it again. In his new book, he now says homosexuality is addictive. It's addictive! Apparently so is stupidity and intolerance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was the debut of Alan Keyes' new talk show on MSNBC, called 'Alan Keyes Making Sense.' Isn't that like just NBC? They finally give a black man a TV show, and make him start work on Martin Luther Ling Day?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just before I came out here, I heard George W. Bush talking about his new security plan for commercial aviation in this country. Beginning tomorrow, every commercial flight in this country will have a hockey dad onboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has a big weekend planned. He's going to stay in the White House and watch television, just like he did last weekend. He'll be just like Cheney, he'll be hooked up to an IV the whole time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's going to watch football on television, and he said this weekend, instead of pretzels, it'll be soup. So I think we can all breathe a sigh of relief there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had kind of a development in the Enron case. They found some missing documents, and the people got very excited and very nervous. But it turned out the documents were just Al Gore ballots from Florida about a year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former presidents have their presidential libraries, and I believe sometime this week they broke ground down in Little Rock for the President Clinton library. And it has this distinction. So far, it's the first presidential library with an adult section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;News from Afghanistan: Osama bin Laden has apparently selected a successor, a guy to follow him, you know, in case things go haywire for him, take his place. He's a 30-year-old one-eyed man. And a lot of experts are disappointed. They were hoping he would pick a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the hunt for Osama bin Laden is really heating up now. They've brought in those three private eyes that Michael Jordan's wife hired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently now for the last six or seven years, Michael Jordan has had like a half a dozen girlfriends while he's married. And I'm thinking to myself, well good God, forget the NBA, this guy is presidential material.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the government has hired the Disney company to show them how they can provide airport security in a more friendly and cheerful manner. Okay. That's what I want when I'm in a hurry, Goofy patting me down, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, a lot of innocent people are having trouble with airport security. Like a woman who has a metal clasp in her bra. You get searched. Like last week, a congressman was stopped because he had a steel rod in his leg. John Dingell. I get stopped because I have these buns of steel.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shoe bomber, that Richard Reid guy, they have emails that he sent to his mother. Apparently, he would email his mother all the time. You know every mom in America will throw this in your face, 'Oh, the shoe bomber has time to email his mother every day. But you, Mr. Big Shot in California, you can't call once a week.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15 more Al Qaeda prisoners arrived in Cuba after getting out of one of those huge cargo planes. I bet illegal immigrants are having a big laugh over this. 15 guys in a cargo plane. They can get 15 guys in the back of a Geo Metro hatchback.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the Pentagon defended the treatment of these Al Qaeda prisoners. They said these are people who would gnaw and chew on the hydraulic cables of the plane. They would actually chew on the cables on the plane. Man, how bad is the food on that flight?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great Britain, God bless them, they're our friend. Great Britain is defending America's treatment of the Al Qaeda prisoners. In a statement today, they said, 'Hey, at least they have toothbrushes. We don't even have those here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But some human rights activists still complaining about the treatment. Apparently, some of the prisoners are being forced to wear blacked-out goggles so they can't see. In fact, these are the same goggles that the refs used during that Raiders game over the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Bill Clinton is visiting Israel this week. As if the Jews haven't suffered enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He gave a speech yesterday and then he went to visit his two favorite cities in the Holy Land, Sodom and Gomorrah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS is planning &quot;a four-hour miniseries on the life of Adolf Hitler, or as Pat Buchanan calls it, a 'return to good family entertainment.' Today Buchanan gave it one arm up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Willie Nelson says he wants to legalize marijuana. He says the only reason marijuana is not legal already is that there aren't enough marijuana smokers who vote. Gee, I wonder what the problem is, huh? Think maybe trouble getting to the polls possibly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They report that several countries are gonna loan Afghanistan a total of $1.5 billion. Loan them $1.5 billion. Yeah, which means that Afghanistan is now in much better financial shape than Kmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight on NBC, Tom Brokaw went behind the scenes at the White House and followed President Bush around with a camera crew. The show was called 'The Real West Wing.' I saw a clip of it, pretty interesting. Next week, NBC adding a bag of pretzels and calling it 'White House Fear Factor.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Chelsea Clinton in the news this week? You see her on the front page of a bunch of magazines, she was in Europe, or Paris or something, hanging out with Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna, hanging with Paltrow and Madonna. And today her dad, Bill, called and said 'Why don't you bring your friends home once in a while?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, former President Clinton currently in Israel trying to get the peace process going. Today Clinton told the Israelis and the Palestinians, he said, 'Hey, if Hillary and I can live together, you can live together.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you know the US is receiving international pressure over how we're treating the Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoner situation. You know, where were these people when the Taliban was abusing women?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what we should do? I don't think the US should run the camps at all. We should bring over the women of Afghanistan, let them run the camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US government has hired the Disney company, hired Walt Disney company to show them how they can provide airport security in a more friendly and cheerful manner. In fact, I was at the airport over the weekend, I think I saw two employees working there, Dopey and Sleepy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the US government announced today that our national state of high alert will continue until Tyson goes back on Prozac.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Washington, the Hart Senate office building was reopened today after all traces of anthrax were eliminated. Isn't that nice? It's a good thing. Yeah.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American Taliban fighter, Johnny Walker, back in the US, he arrived yesterday. In fact, the first thing he said when he landed on American soil was, 'That Tyson's a nut case. What's going on with that guy?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Johnny Walker's attorney says that when Walker was caught he kept asking for a lawyer. I love this. I love this. The guy was a member of the Taliban, he moved there, he wanted to live the life of a Taliban, was ready to die for the Taliban, as soon as he's in America, 'I want a lawyer. I want a phone call. Where's my hair cut?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see Walker's father? He's says, 'My son loves America.' Yeah, like O.J. loved his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Enron is now officially out of the energy business. They've got gone into a new business, confetti. They make confetti.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CEO of Enron, Kenneth Lay, has resigned. They'll soon be calling him by a new name, 'Prison Lay.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is outraged, outraged at Enron. Yeah, you know his own mother-in-law lost a ton of dough in Enron stock. Let me tell you something. Nothing makes a married guy madder than the prospect that your mother-in-law might move in with you because she's broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see that one scene&quot; on NBC's &quot;Inside the Real West Wing&quot; where &quot;Bush was bench pressing 180 pounds? That was pretty good. Let me tell you something, when Clinton was in the White House he was bench pressing chicks twice that size.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has hired the Disney company to show them how they can provide airport security in a more friendly and cheerful manner. And I guess it's working, the only problem now, you have to be at least this tall to get on the plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to reports from the US military that they just released, Osama bin Laden is apparently hiding in a remote and incredibly desolate region. That's what they said. That's true. They said that. In other words, Osama is hiding out at Kmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The producers of 'Friends' say that President Bush's fashion model niece, Lauren, is gonna make an appearance on an upcoming episode of 'Friends.' Isn't that something? Yeah, and not only that -- not only that, they say, at any point, Dick Cheney could end up on 'ER.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CEO of Enron, Ken Lay, has quit his job as chairman. Gee, he was doing so good.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well of course he quit, the company's broke, there's nothing left to steal, might as well get out now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said what the company needs now is a specialist in bankruptcy. I thought he was the specialist in bankruptcy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what he's asking for? Listen to this. He is demanding the company gives him a $51 million severance package. Isn't that amazing? All of these people are broke, they lose all their money. You know, we should give to it him. Give it to him in shredded $20 bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; $51 million for causing a disaster and then doing nothing. That's Mariah Carey money, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the father of the American Taliban fighter there, what's his name? John Walker, says his son really loves America. Oh yeah, yeah, that's why we had to drag him back here in leg irons and shackles, from Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see the father yesterday at that press conference? He tries to make his son sound like the most patriotic guy in the world. I watched this, take a look at this piece of tape. This is the father talking. See how many times he can say the word America in 12 seconds [bell rings 6 times].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the head of the Muslim school in Pakistan where Johnny Walker stayed said that Walker was not only a big fan of the Taliban he also looked forward to having four wives. Four wives? Kind of ironic, now he's going to prison, he will have four husbands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, today on the news they showed a bunch of Afghan farmers planting poppy seeds. And one of the farmers said that he knows that people will die from the heroin that he grows, but if he doesn't grow poppies, his family will starve to death. Here's a crazy idea. Why don't you grow food? Kill two birds with one stone, or maybe a potato. How about that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody see 'The Real West Wing' the other night? It was pretty good. Tom Brokaw followed President Bush around the White House with a camera crew and Bush was pretty candid. He's talking and he said, 'you cannot please everyone, including your wife.' . That's what he said. That's the difference between him and Clinton. Clinton tried to please everyone except his wife. A little different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And President Bush said today he will ask Congress for an extra $50 billion for defense. That's just to protect us from Mike Tyson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush unveiled a $38 billion homeland security plan. Yeah, it's a good idea. Yeah, the President said that under the new plan, we can wipe out the threat of pretzels in our lifetime. Get rid of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that Enron Field, where the Houston Astros play, will probably change its name by the end of the season. They're going to get rid of the name Enron Field, yeah. Apparently the new name will be 'oh, my god, we're totally screwed field.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge in Philadelphia has ordered Miss Cleo -- you know, the famous psychic lady? Well, they've ordered her to stop pressing people to pay for calls they thought were free. It says free but not free. Some people got bills as much as $700. $700? And most of those were Enron executives asking for investment advice.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is getting ready now to sue the Bush Administration to force Vice President Dick Cheney to disclose what went on in those meetings with the Enron executives.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, it gets worse every day. In fact, you know what Ken Lay had for breakfast this morning? Shredded wheat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Kenneth Lay, the CEO of Enron canceled the scheduled meeting he had with Jesse Jackson this weekend. They were supposed to meet. Jesse went down there on behalf of the Enron employees. Jackson was disappointed because he thought he would be able to relate to Ken Lay, 'cause, you know, they both screwed their employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American Taliban fighter, John Walker, or Johnny Walker or Johnny Walker Lindh, whatever he calls himself now, appeared in a Virginia court again today wearing a cheap green jump suit. So, nice to see somebody's still shopping at Kmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legal analysts say that Walker's lawyer -- they're gonna try and plea bargain now. That's what they're trying to work out. They're trying to plea bargain the chargers down from traitor to just being an idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night on the news, First Lady Laura Bush said the day her husband choked on the pretzel, she was upstairs in the White House when he called her for help. Of course, when she picked up the phone she heard someone gagging and choking on the other end. She said, 'No, Clinton doesn't live here anymore.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech at Georgetown University,&quot; Afghan leader Hamid Karzai &quot;invited all Afghans to return home, even if they have a different passport. He said it's okay. Whatever passport you have, you can come back to Afghanistan. 'Cause, let's face it. I don't think Afghanistan has ever been too picky about who they let in in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amtrak announced this week they have lost $1.1 billion last year. And most of that was money falling out of people's pockets when the trains are upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky is now deciding on a bill that would make cloning illegal. Here's my question -- who's gonna clone somebody from Kentucky?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're finding out more about these folks down there in Texas, the Enron people. They were having sex in the office. Sex in the office and they're shredding documents, and keep one thing in mind, these are Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they got this John Walker, the American Taliban guy who's going to go on trial now.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier tonight, President Bush's State of the Union address was televised on every single channel. See, they do this so Americans in remote locations -- you know, like Dick Cheney -- will be able to see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know if Cheney was going to be sitting behind the President, because usually the Vice President sits behind the President. Like an idiot, I call the White House today. I said, 'Can I have the White House press office?' Okay. 'Press office.' I go, 'Oh, hi. I want to find out, will Dick Cheney be at State of the Union address?' And this guy goes, 'Why do you want to know?' I don't want to say, 'Because I want to make jokes about him.' I go, 'Um,' click, and I just hung up. And I go, 'Oh, now, I'm a terrorist. Now, I'm an idiot.' So if you're watching, that was me today that called.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big rumor going around is, we may begin bombing Iraq, or as the White House calls it - 'Operation: Keep Enron off the front page.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney finally responds today to the demands that he reveal the details of his Enron meetings. And this is what he said. He said - 'He met with unnamed person from unspecified companies for an indeterminate amount of time at an undisclosed location.' Well, thank God he cleared that up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway, she's on the Today show yesterday and she said her husband is an 'honest, decent, moral man who has done nothing wrong.' And today Hillary Clinton says, 'You go, girl!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cowardly guy -- this Enron guy, he sends his wife -- he sends his wife to appear for him on the Today show to explain things. You know, tell her, 'Honey, hold the wheel of the Titanic, I'm gonna check the light bulb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And anyway, she went on to say in the interview yesterday that -- she said, 'They've lost all of their money.' Kenneth Lay -- oh, they've lost all of their money. Oh, don't worry. Luckily, they still got plenty of everybody else's money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's your tax dollars at work, folks. You wonder why taxes are high? It's the Department of Justice. You know the statue -- you know the bare-breasted lady that holds the scale? Show this. Here it is. There it is. Do you see the background? See? Okay. Well, they've covered her breasts because Attorney General John Ashcroft very upset -- very upset about constantly being photographed in front of a seminude statue. It was draped. They put a thing over her breasts at a cost of $8,000. It cost -- it cost us $8,000. Wouldn't it have been cheaper just to have her move a little to the left?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And according to the latest report from Afghanistan, the remaining Taliban members are now using cell phones to communicate. But we have a secret plan to discuss their communication. We're gonna switch them over to Verizon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some sad news about President Bush's niece. Did you hear about this? Allegedly, at 1:00 in the morning, 24-year-old Noelle Bush tried to fraudulently obtain prescription drugs at a Walgreens store with a phony prescription. This is Jeb Bush's daughter. See, here's where she made her mistake. Instead of getting the drugs at Walgreens, should have gone to Kmart. No witnesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world champions Los Angeles Lakers were in Washington yesterday, where they met President Bush at the White House. And, you know, President Bush has a dress code in the Oval Office. Did you know this? You cannot go in the Oval Office unless you have, like, a sports coat or a sports jacket or a suit coat on, and Shaq didn't have one. Yeah. Luckily, there was one left behind by Janet Reno, so he wore that and he was able to go in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know President Bush gave his State of the Union speech earlier tonight. This is big. And he said that he would ask Congress for a $48 billion increase for defense spending. That's what he wants -- an increase for defense -- yeah. Yeah, and that's just for protection against pretzels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Enron -- Enron has hired a new CEO who's a specialist in turning around companies that are in trouble. They just hired this guy to help 'em out. Yeah, and apparently the guy's off to a really bad start because the first thing he did is change the company's name to Kmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

While he was speaking, they had online translation in Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin Chinese. So, I guess he's really trying to reach out to the people of California.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said he's going to put terrorist training camps out of business. He's going to put them out of business. And I believe him. Hey, what company hasn't gone out of business since he's been in office?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought that was nice, up in the balcony, President Bush introduced two flight attendants who helped subdue that guy with the bomb in his shoe in the flight over the Atlantic. Actually, that's not unusual. Bush is not the first President to bring a couple of flight attendants to his speech. I think Clinton did it all of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, NBC will air a special, special episode of 'Fear Factor.' This is going to be good. They're going to lower Dick Cheney into a pit filled with officials investigating the Enron scandal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out Enron workers were not only shredding documents at work, they were having sex at work. Having sex and shredding documents at the office. Boy, those are two things you don't want to get mixed up, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House aides threw a surprise birthday party for Vice President Dick Cheney. . Isn't that kind risky, a room full of people yelling 'surprise' to Dick Cheney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Florida, Governor Jeb Bush signed a new bill designating today as 'Take your daughter to jail day.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor's 24-year-old daughter arrested for obtaining drugs with a phony prescription. Yeah, kind of sad. The pharmacist said he got suspicious when he noticed the prescription said 'Take two before partying.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the part I don't understand. She got drugs at a Walgreens drive- thru pharmacy. Doesn't every medication you buy have a warning that says, 'Do not operate motor vehicles or heavy machinery?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kentucky now deciding on a bill that would make cloning illegal in the start of Kentucky. Kentucky officials said today, 'Human beings should only reproduce at the way God intended, at family reunions.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you saw the George Bush State of the Union speech last night? Pretty good speech, rousing, inspirational, and I liked it at the end when he pardoned his niece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His niece, his brother's daughter was arrested in Florida for prescription fraud. That's interesting. In Florida, fraudulent prescriptions, they're illegal, but fraudulent elections, they're OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so cold, at San Francisco airport a terrorist tried to board a plane with a snow shoe bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People still talking about President Bush's big state of the Enron -- I mean, State of the Union -- I'm sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, I think people are motivated by President Bush. We've all done jokes about him, but you like to see a President give a strong, passionate, uplifting speech. It makes you feel good. See, it's different than the Clinton speeches. Like, every time Clinton gave a speech, you'll be lookin' at him goin', 'Hmm, I wonder which ho gave him that tie?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also warned about ticking time bombs in this country that are set to go off at any second. But enough about Mike Tyson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Ashcroft, at the Department of Justice they have the statue -- you know the female justice's blind lady? You know, she holds the scale and she has the robe, and one breast is exposed., And he wants her covered up, because it shows the naked breast. He doesn't like nudity. He doesn't approve smoking. He doesn't approve of drinking or dancing. Well, thank God we put him in charge of finding those religious fanatics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is another example of your government at work. You know Gary Condit, our friend Gary Condit? He is on the congressional committee for homeland security.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some Super Bowl gossip, listen to this. Do you know the Super Bowl committee originally chose Kenneth Lay, the CEO of Enron, to do the coin toss? I'm not making that up. Then they changed their mind when they realized we can't trust this guy with a coin.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this weekend the state of the union speech, President Bush said, 'whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay it.' And today Lockheed and other defense contracts told the Army, 'our last estimates were a little low there.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush also urged every American to perform 4,000 hours of community service and today his Jeb Bush's daughter Noelle said, 'it's my first offense, give me a break, will you?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's my favorite story this week. The Justice Department paid over $8,000 for a garment to cover the breast of the statue, Lady Justice of the Department of Justice. . John Ashcroft was embarrassed to stand under the naked breast, so they covered it. That's the difference between the Bush and the Clinton Administration. Clinton paid eight grand to give the statue breast implants. He put those in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Ashcroft is getting out of hand. What's that nuclear plant down there.you know, down in San Diego? See, here it is, look what he did. He had that covered today, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, Enron, the company? They have a new CEO, Steven Cooper, he says he's going to get the company back to its core business, screwing customers, not screwing shareholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yesterday, that NASA satellite fell out of the sky, I think it fell in the Mideast somewhere, more reasons for these people to love us. Earlier in the week NASA issued a warning that it was going to fall, they didn't know where. What is that going to do? A 7,000 pound satellite may fall out of the sky. Oh, good, I'll wear a hat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, 'Sesame Street' is gonna air a week of shows that help children understand the war on terrorism. . That's nice. Yeah, which explains why Oscar the Grouch is being held in a trash can in Guantanamo Bay. Very humanely treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And down there in Washington at the White House, they're getting ready for the Super Bowl. The Secret Service spent all day mashing George Bush's pretzels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney will be watching the Super Bowl from an undisclosed sports bar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of Presidents, according to reports now, Bush can bench- press 180 pounds. That's nice to know that he's in that kind of shape, isn't it? Or as President Clinton refers to it, that's half an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, Bill Clinton right now is on a diplomatic mission to Israel where he advised Israel on how to co-exist with a neighbor that you hate. He said, smile in public and have sex with another country is what he said. Our man, Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The player who kicked the game winning field goal for New England, Adam Vinatieri -- did you see what happened today? Got an invitation today from Congress.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush announced he wants to start an abstinence program for students. Students? How about have some program for those teachers having sex with the students?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the Justice Department last week spent $8,000 to cover up the semi-nude statue, you know the lady of justice holding the scales, they covered it, thought it was obscene, covered the statue. If you count Enron that's pretty much the second thing this month they've covered up, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I saw that new bin Laden video on CNN over the weekend. Man, he looks old, he looks tired, he was incoherent and he was rambling. I realized, no, that was 'Larry King Weekend.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And United Press International reporting that documents have been uncovered at Al Qaeda training camps, this is pretty scary, that show that terrorists tried to kill President Clinton. That's for real. Really kind of unbelievable. Al Qaeda studied all of Clinton's movements, but like Congress, never able to catch him with his pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush said today he's going to put terrorist training camps out of business. You know how he's going to do it? Turn them all into Kmarts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm furious. Not only did the Patriots win, they are holding the Rams as detainees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's nice about the Super Bowl, the exciting commercials. You like watching the commercials, it's fun, isn't it? My favorite one was the 'We're the axis of evil spot' produced by Iran, Iraq and North Korea, did you like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But during the game, how about that powerful anti-drug commercial? Paid for by the US government, you know what I'm talking about, very powerful anti-drug message by the US government. It ran right between the 7th and 8th Budweiser commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush got through the Super Bowl without event. The Secret Service had pre-chewed his pretzels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love how self-righteous all the other politicians get. Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings said today, he only got $3,500 over the last couple of years from Enron. That's all he got. He said that wasn't even a contribution, that was an insult. Now the Democrats are complaining their bribes weren't big enough. 'Hey, we got screwed.' They have bribe envy now, apparently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That American Taliban kid, Johnny Walker, indicted today, ten counts of terrorism. He could get five life sentences and he's pretty happy about it. In Taliban terms, that's 360 virgins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, he's got a good lawyer. I think a good lawyer said he can plea bargain it down to three life sentences.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Yeah, in response, most celebrities say they have bodyguards because Charlton Heston carries a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the thing about Enron, and keep this in the back of your mind in the future. Enron, turns out, it was just a bunch of shell companies and corporations with phony profits, a bunch of shyster lawyers, and crooked accountants. Wait a minute, that's CBS.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How's this for nerve? The lawyer for the American Taliban kid Johnny Walker -- you know that kid? The lawyer has asked a Federal judge to release Walker, claiming he is not a flight risk nor is he a threat to society. No, no. Just because a guy goes through a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, right away people think he might be a flight risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, if he's not a flight risk, let's put him on the same flight as that lawyer, okay? Just send the two of them off.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Walker's attorney said that in the days after Walker was captured, he was starved, blindfolded, stripped of his clothes, shackled with duct tape and held inside a cold, metal container. Oh, shut up. We do that every week on 'Fear Factor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the Justice Department released copies of two emails sent by Walker to his mother where he criticized America, and he said in the emails he hopes he never steps foot in America again. See, that's the good thing about hanging somebody. Their feet don't touch the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the US has admitted that after months and months of searching, we still have no idea where Osama bin Laden is. Osama bin Laden? We can't even find Kenneth Lay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about Lay? He's disappeared. Nobody knows where he is. He refused to testify before Congress the other day, and Congress was really looking forward to him coming because usually when he goes to Congress, he brings everybody a check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since he didn't show up for the hearing on Monday, Congressman Gary Condit says he may quit now. Condit said today on the news, 'Look, the day I can't get a Lay in Congress, I'm out of here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, folks, I just hope this whole Enron scandal doesn't turn kids off to the exciting career in accounting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A California woman is accusing America West Airlines -- or an American West Airline gate agent of touching her inappropriately during one of those searches at the phoenix airport. Yes, this woman is serious. She's very upset with this American West Airlines guy for touching her like that, especially since she was flying on Delta at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American Bar Association announced today they have completed a five-year project to overhaul the code of ethics for lawyers. You mean all this time lawyers have been following a code of ethics? Apparently, it must have been some sort of secret code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush was in New York earlier today to speak at a fundraiser. Yeah. Apparently the Secret Service was so worried about Bush's security, they had the police clear the streets of all pretzel stands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MTV has announced that Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to host a show where he'll answer questions from MTV viewers. Yeah, MTV says Powell will answer questions about terrorism, the war in Afghanistan and why AJ is his favorite Backstreet Boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's another one of those American Taliban guys. Remember John Walker. There's another one. This time the guy is from New Jersey. It's a kid from New Jersey goes to Afghanistan and joins the Taliban. I'm thinking, why doesn't this kid just join the mob like everybody else in New Jersey?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who is in town today in New York City? George W. Bush, our President of the US. It's a fundraiser and you have to give him credit they are being very creative with their fundraising. For $10,000 you can give George W. the Heimlich maneuver.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, the big story today was announced, they found more papers -- they found more of those papers talking about the destruction of America. And that was just out of the Enron headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Congress is holding hearings now on the ethics of corporate accounting. And for many congressmen, this is their first experience. Not with accounting, with ethics.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Houston Astros want to change the name of Enron field where they play. I guess the Enron name is starting to cause problems for them. Like, players would steal a base and then deny it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today in Houston, ten Enron executives got stuck in an elevator at the Enron headquarters. The power went out in Houston, ten guys stuck in a little 8' x 10' space, which would be good practice when they go to prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taliban kid, Johnny Walker, you know the one accused of fighting against America. Well, now his lawyer is requesting he be freed into his parents custody. Oh, and they did just a great job the first 18 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lawyer said his client should be free because he is not a risk to flee. Walker gave the lawyer his word he wouldn't run away. You know, and if you can't believe a spoiled, little, terrorist traitor who betrayed his country, who can you believe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, on board a United Airlines flight from Miami to Argentina, a passenger stormed the cockpit, kicked the bottom half of the door open. He got about halfway inside the cockpit. The pilot hit him in the head with an axe. Yeah. On the news, they said the guy is probably not a terrorist. Well, not any more! He got hit in the head with an axe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate has subpoenaed former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay and he's going to have to testify in front of the Senate next week. True story. Yeah, apparently the senators are going to question lay on why he let them accept so much money from Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA is now saying a drone rocket may have killed Osama bin Laden way up in the mountains. I just heard that. That's what the CIA is saying. Let me translate for you. What they're saying actually is he's still alive and they have no idea where the hell he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say a missile hit during a high level meeting in a cave. How high level a meeting could this be if they're having it in a cave, for God's sakes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rumors that former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is missing and I'm thinking, has somebody checked Dick Cheney's pockets?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you go to Salt Lake City, the Olympic committee is handing out condoms. . Everybody visiting the Olympics, here's what you get: You'll receive free condoms, lip balm and hand warmers. That's right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the grand finale, the guy came out and lit the Olympic rings on fire with his skates. Didn't we just arrest a bomber for the same thing?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know we have more troops in Salt Lake City at these games than we do in Afghanistan? I'm not making it up. There are more Army troops in Salt Lake than in Afghanistan. Why don't we take the gold, we got men, let's get in there. What are we doing? You don't have to compete!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they had to cancel the ski jumping today because of high winds. I don't know if you saw the gusts, it was pretty bad. Everybody's face was pulled back like Greta van Susteren.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess they had another groping incident by a security guard today. Did you hear about this? Katie Couric was groped by one of the security personnel. Show what happened when Katie went through security. See there is Clinton there. See that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the government has temporarily banned any foreign visitors from getting guns or ammunitions around the Olympics, which will make it of course a lot safer, and then we win the biathalon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And United Airlines has a new slogan, we love to hit you in the head with an ax and it shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a frightening story. Hear about this a guy from Uruguay. . Tried to kick in the cockpit door from Miami to Argentina, the copilot hit him in the head with an ax, with an ax. Usually the only time that happens is when a coach passenger sticks his head between the curtains of coach and first class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you like me, when you see the little guys [Enron executives] with their expensive suits and the black glasses, don't you say, oh, man, how long are they going to last in prison? They don't realize, inside trading means a whole different thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a coalition of Christian and conservative groups have asked the FTC to investigate the Fox Network for systematically violating the nation's indecency law. Fox is willing to meet with the group, they invited them for a weekend on 'Temptation Island.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York police report that drug dealers are now selling a brand of heroin named after Osama bin Laden. Yeah, apparently the dealers are also selling an even deadlier brand of heroin called Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Olympic Committee has said that Afghanistan cannot fly their new flag. They can't fly their new flag, and also, they cannot use their Taliboggin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, we have the First Lady of the US on the show tonight. It's very exciting. And the guy out front, frisking people and doing strip searches, he's not Secret Service. He just hangs around here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Huge international scandal brewing in Poland. It seems the ambulance drivers are deliberately letting hundreds of passengers have poor emergency care, and letting people die on the way to the hospital so they can steer them to certain funeral homes so they can get a kickback. Of course, in America, it's called an HMO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great news from United Airlines today. They didn't hit one single passenger in the head with an ax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you know that story. On a flight from Miami to Argentina last week, the copilot hit a passenger on the head with an ax after the passenger tried to kick the cockpit door in. And let me tell you, after he hit that guy on the head, not one passenger on the plane complained about the in-flight meal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And today, the guy hit with the ax says he has half a mind to sue the airline.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, that's the first real controversy of the Olympics. By 5-4 the Russian judges, they voted to give the gold medal to the Russian skaters over the Canadians, who looked like they won. Of course! The Canadians won. You know the problem? It's the exchange rate. Gold in Canada is only silver here.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a big surprise in Olympics at the curling competition, a big surprise. Some people actually watched it. I'm sorry. I don't get it. If you are not familiar with curling, it's like the Al Gore of Olympic sports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of new rules because of the Olympics. The US government has temporarily banned foreign visitors from obtaining guns or ammunition during the Olympic games. Here's my question. Why is it a temporary ban? 'I'm sorry, Abdul, sorry. You have to wait another 14 days until you get your rocket launcher and AK-47 back, just until the week after next.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay went to church in Houston. And on the way out of church, a reporter asked him how he was doing. And he said, 'With God's help, we'll get through it.' And the Devil said, 'Wait a minute. I thought we had a deal.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know a lot of politicians who got donations from Enron are giving money back to help the investors. Because a lot of politicians got money from them. Even Hillary Clinton is giving back the $6,000 she got. She doesn't want the Clinton name associated with a scandal. Can you imagine?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is sending Vice President Dick Cheney to the Middle East next month. Do you think Bush's opinion of Cheney has changed? Remember two weeks ago, 'Where's Cheney?' In a safe undisclosed location, hidden away. As soon as Enron pops up, they send him to the most dangerous place in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Abe Lincoln's birthday. President Clinton celebrated the same way he always does. He went to the theater and took a shot at a woman in the balcony.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Didn't you feel sorry for the Canadian skaters? They should have won. Everybody thought they should have won.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay testified before Congress, I think it was yesterday as a matter of fact. I believe he is the first Lay to be subpoenaed since...since Monica, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the Hall of the Presidents they unveiled a new President Bush robot, you know, the exact robot of President Bush. But today, it choked on a lug nut and passed out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does that make Al Gore feel? Bush as a robot? He beat Gore at his own game. I mean, right there, Gore is going, 'You leave me nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the Middle East, in Yemen, a suspected member of Al Qaida in, accidentally blew himself up. They believe he trained at one of the terrorist schools, but must have been sick the day they covered hand grenades. Kids, stay in school.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about Jim Shea winning the gold medal in the men's skeleton? That was great. That's a great story. You all know he's the third generation winter Olympian in his family. And he says the key to his success, visualization.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is in China, hoping the Chinese will agree not to sell missiles and nuclear technology to other countries, but so far China refused. They feel they worked hard to steal all the technology. 'We can do whatever we want with it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President George Bush is in China, and he had a meeting with Jiang Zemin, the premier over there. It was interesting. They're negotiating a lot of very, very sensitive, very delicate issues, and George Bush said, 'Okay, we will stop bothering you about human rights.'&quot; We said that to Jiang Zemin -- and he promised that the Chinese would develop a leak- proof takeout container.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you got to feel sorry for the President. This is one embarrassment after another. They had the big state banquet there with Jiang Zemin.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Olympics, &quot;now they have these events where everybody goes downhill on this ice track. They have like the bobsled, they have the luge, and now they brought back the skeleton. And they're fairly similar, they're quite similar. They use the same track. In the one, you go down on your back. The other one, you go down on your stomach. And then I think the third one, you go down sitting up. Now, I don't have a punchline for this, but if I did...it would include the name Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The flight attendant Gary Condit had an affair with -- what was her name, Anne Marie Smith? She is now endorsing him for Congress. Think about this -- he had an affair with her, ruins her life, ruins her reputation, and she stands by him. I mean, Frank Gifford's gotta be thinking, 'Why can't I find a flight attendant like this?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Hillary Clinton spending this week in Israel. A little embarrassing moment when she went to check into the hotel in Israel. Yeah, I guess she told the guy she was Mrs. Clinton, and the clerk said, 'Of course you are.' Apparently the third Mrs. Clinton they had there this week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new clues of Osama bin Laden, may not be dead after all. They think he may be living somewhere on the Afghan border. So first he's dead, then he's alive, then he's dead, then he's alive. This guy's been pronounced dead more times than Dick Cheney at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Vice President Dick Cheney getting ready for his big trip to the Middle East, or as they're calling his mission, 'Operation Avoid Enron Subpoena.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush Administration announced today they are considering sending 1,000 old computers to Afghanistan to help their government get started over there. Oh, yeah, that's what they need to get back on their feet, huh? A game of 'Pong' on a Commodore 64.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit told Larry King after taking six months off, he is ready to avoid questions again. He's ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it's a reelection thing. Last night he was on Larry King Live, tonight he's on Jiminy Glick.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Buffalo International Airport was shut down for 45 minutes today, and hundreds of passengers had to be re-screened after it was discovered the metal detector was unplugged. Okay. Great. Let's just give the terrorists an express lane now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The really bad thing is when it's unplugged -- you see, the bad thing is it was the beeping that was keeping the security guards awake.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, 20 workers at Boston's Logan Airport were charged with lying to get their job security badges. That's a scary thought, huh? That means the guy at the airport that sticks his hands down your pants might not be qualified for that job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Gary Condit, who is back in the news because he's running for reelection, is still claiming he didn't realize how the media would handle it. Did you see him on Larry King? Could he have been sleazier? He said he had no idea what happened to Chandra Levy. He didn't know there would be all this attention on this case. He had no idea the media would go crazy. And here's the amazing part -- this guy is on the Intelligence Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And speaking of sleaze balls and liars, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling -- you know this guy, the CEO? He appeared before Congress. Do you think they even bother swearing him in? You know? 'Go ahead, put your hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth -- oh, never mind. Just sit down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, now, he's denying that he lied to Congress last week. Now, he says it was just the liquor talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's my favorite thing about Skilling. If you saw the testimony today, when he was asked about a $5.6 million bonus check he got, he said he didn't remember receiving it. And who hasn't had that oversight, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, you've all heard of her. She's leaving PBS&quot;NewsHour' with Jim Lehrer after she was accused of plagiarizing other writers. Yeah, when asked to comment, Goodwin told the press, 'I have nothing to fear but fear itself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;USA Today reports that the Federal Government has sent 700 national guardsmen to patrol the US border with Canada. That's right. Yeah, apparently, the troops were sent to the border to prevent a comeback by Celine Dion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, I hear Jayson Williams is looking for a new limo driver. So that could work out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government has a new plan where they want to make welfare recipients work for their money. I got an idea -- how about making Federal employees work for their money? There you go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other night, President Bush invited Mel Gibson to the White House for a private screening of his new film, 'We Were Soldiers.' And not to be outdone, Gary Condit held a private screening of 'Big Fat Liar.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney still refusing to turn over documents from his top secret energy reform task force. Remember those meetings he had with Enron? Well, Congress has a subpoena on those documents, but he told Congress today, he said, 'Hey, you can have them over my dead body.' And they said, 'Hey, we can't wait till Monday. We need these now.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy birthday to Chelsea Clinton -- 22 years old yesterday. God, she was just a little girl, remember that? 22 years old. She and her father spent the day together, which is nice. I guess he took her shopping, then they went to dinner. And I thought this was sweet. We always do Clinton jokes. This was very nice. He got all the waitresses to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her. And you know, they don't usually do that at Hooters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several major tobacco companies have been accused of violating the trade embargo by smuggling billions of cigarettes into Iraq. And I don't know what kind of cigarettes they were, but I'm guessing maybe - Camels?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Survivor IV tonight premiered here on CBS. They take people to exotic locations and they...no, wait, those are the Taliban prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past two days, two major airports, Chicago and Los Angeles, have been shut down after the metal detectors were left unplugged. Well, nice to see things are working out well since the Federal government took over security, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I think happens? This is what I think happens. I think any time an attractive woman comes through, the guy kicks it. 'Oh, we're going to have to pat you down, miss.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's something -- I don't know if this is scary or creepy or what this is. President Bush has revealed today there is a shadow government of 100 people who live outside Washington in bunkers standing by to take over if Washington is ever attacked. You see I thought the shadow government was the one Enron bought with all those contributions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said these are.known as stand-by Federal workers. As opposed to the usual stand-around Federal workers that you see in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Smithsonian Institute announced today they are planning on putting on display Enron's code of ethics. They're going to be right next to Gary Condit's marriage vows. Right there in their little separate section.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love this. This Gary Condit guy is unbelievable. You get the government you deserve if this guy gets elected. He said today he thinks there are enough voters out there to get him a win in the primaries. Have you seen his polling numbers? He's three points behind anthrax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two doctors in Britain have developed a line of sterile maggots for cleaning and disinfecting wounds. They put maggots -- these sterile maggots on your cut and the maggots eat and clean the wound. So apparently Britain has HMOs too, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan the Taliban is getting back together. That's what they said in the news today. Yeah, folks, even scarier, it's been reported that Hall and Oates are getting back together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Friday night. Do you know where your mayor is? You know, what's happened is Mayor Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City.he didn't say anything about this during the campaign, but every weekend he jets off to a mysterious location, just gone. It's like Batman, nobody knows where the guy goes on the weekends. 5:00 Friday, adios. And people are criticizing him for leaving the city on the weekends, but in his defense, Michael Bloomberg loves New York. As a matter of fact, he considers it his second home. So what do you want from the guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the usual mix of contestants on 'Survivor.' You have a bartender, you have a school teacher and an escaped Taliban leader. They're all there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you all know about this, that's the big story, the shadow government.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this whole shadow government thing should not come as a surprise to Americans. I mean, have you noticed how much that we pay in taxes? That couldn't possibly be for one government. Of course, there must be at least three or four more of these governments out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge says he opposes the idea of letting pilots openly carry guns in the cockpit. He said if pilots want to bring guns aboard, 'Hey, they have to sneak them through security just like everybody else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it happened again folks. Los Angeles Airport had to be evacuated today after screeners found a fake hand grenade, a phony hand grenade wrapped in a gift box. It went through the X-ray machine, which is amazing. The X-ray machine was actually plugged in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the major tobacco companies have been smuggling billions of billions of cigarettes into Iraq. Where is their patriotism? They are supposed to be killing Americans with those cigarettes, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And a White House source says that under a new proposal by President Bush, you probably heard about this, some women on welfare could get paid for getting married. Getting money for getting married. This is known as the 'Anna Nicole Smith' bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember last week, they announced that Amy Fisher was going to box Tanya Harding on the fox network on March 13th. Well, Amy Fisher is out, Paula Jones is in. Isn't this amazing? Paula Jones is gonna fight Tanya Harding. Amy Fisher couldn't make it. Apparently she has a mud wrestling conflict that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, they said this is the only fight officially sanctioned by Hee-Haw.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, originally, they were going to have Monica Lewinsky fight Tanya, but Tanya didn't want to move up three weight classes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody watch that Monica Lewinsky documentary on HBO? Who watched it last night, anybody? . You think Clinton watched it, huh? You think Clinton spent all yesterday hiding the remote? 'I don't know where it is, honey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand Linda Tripp taped it. I'm gonna watch it over at her house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And you know, did you notice throughout the whole thing, Monica Lewinsky was sitting on the floor of the stage? Doesn't this woman ever stand up, you know? She's sitting on the floor. She's kneeling on the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think maybe Monica's 15 minutes of stain is just about up, possibly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is election day here in California. And Gary Condit -- remember Gary Condit? He put the member in member of Congress. You remember him. You know what I'm talking about. This is the same Gary Condit who passed his own lie detector test. Well, apparently, he's just announced, he has already tallied the votes, he has won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Forbes' annual list of the richest men in the world came out this week. And once again, Bill Gates, richest man in the world. Number one, richest man in the world. . Gates is number one on the list of the richest men, the other nine are all of the Enron executives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although he's pleading poverty, former Enron President Kenneth Lay, reportedly still owns ten houses worth more than $20 million. That's not even counting the House of Representatives, which he bought last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's that other slimy guy? Oh, Jeffery Skilling, well, he was on Larry King the other night. He said, 'Hey, even a CEO of McDonald's doesn't know everything that's going on in every store.' You know, this guy shouldn't be comparing himself to the CEO of McDonald's. He should be compared to the CEO of 7-Eleven. Because their employees also know what it's like to get robbed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, today was election day here in California. Or as the voters in LA call it, Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm saying voter turnout was low. I've seen more people at Kmart than I have voting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, this is what -- not enough people vote in America. We take our elections for granted. Think about this, where else do ordinary people get a chance to choose the people who will choose the people who will be in our shadow government?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we taped early today, so we don't know the results. I'm not a betting man. I don't think it looks good for Gary Condit. I think even Ms. Cleo could call this one, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's a very scary story. Seems a charter flight from Italy to Cuba had to make an emergency landing over the Atlantic Ocean, one of the engines caught on fire, and the pilot got on the intercom and asked the passengers to vote on whether they should turn back or keep going. Why does the pilot put it to a vote? Isn't that supposed to be his call? You know, it's bad enough, 'Oh, we have to kill the hijackers,' now we have to service the plane, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear what happened at LAX yesterday? Apparently they had to evacuate the entire airport after a security guard spotted a passenger with a suspicious package. Turned out it was just Rupaul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the true story on this? They had to evacuate the whole airport after somebody was caught trying to get through security, they had a fake hand grenade in their bag. A fake bomb. Is nothing real in Los Angeles? You know, is the city so phony, even our bombs are fake? We have plastic boobs, dyed hair, fake bombs, we can't even come up with a real bomb in LA anymore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past Saturday, there was a minor problem with the space shuttle Columbia. Nothing serious, seems the plumbing pipes are clogged up. But NASA didn't do anything about it, 'cause do you know what it costs to get a plumber to go into outer space on a weekend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My favorite story of the week, it's now official. Paula Jones will be boxing Tonya Harding. Thank God. I'm glad she's doing it. Maybe people will finally start to take Paula Jones seriously now, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now this Paula Jones' woman is unbelievable. She said yes to posing nude in Playboy. Oh, she says yes to fighting Tonya Harding on TV. Do you realize the only thing too sleazy for her was President Clinton?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's kind of ironic. Tonya Harding and Paula Jones on a network named Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you watch the Monica Lewinsky special on HBO the other night? She took questions from the audience. And she did a good job. You know, there's one thing about Monica, she never gets tongue tied. You know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox TV has announced that next Wednesday, Paula Jones is going to fight Tonya Harding. Isn't that amazing? It's incredible. Fox is calling the show, 'When white trash attacks.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a rumor in the TV business that ABC might fire Sam Donaldson and replace him with someone younger and hipper. Yeah, apparently, Donaldson's really worried about it, 'cause when he showed up for work today, his toupee had corn rows.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know by now, Gary Condit lost his bid for reelection. You know what this means? You know what happens now? He may actually have to go back to having sex with his own wife.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the good news for Gary Condit, he won't have to pack up a lot of things from his office, because he threw most of that stuff away six months ago before the cops got there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't say much after he lost. He said, 'I've been in public service for 30 years, I live and die by the sword.' To bad he couldn't keep his sword in his pants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you, you know who I felt sorry for yesterday, the guy that was running against Condit. Imagine the pressure he was under? What could be worst than losing to Gary Condit? When voters feel that you're not as trustworthy as Condit, forget politics, get a life, really, at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We keep hearing more and more about this shadow government. Did you hear this story? The shadow government that's lurking outside Washington. The shadow government, ready to take over in case our government fails. You know what Washington really needs? We need a shadow basketball team. Someone who can move in when the Wizards fall and take over.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the tabloids.they say Hillary Clinton has a file of all the women Bill has had affairs with in case she wants to get a divorce. Do you believe this? Does Hillary Clinton really need a file to convince people that Bill was unfaithful?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CEO of Enron Jeffrey Skilling married one of the Enron secretaries this past week. Married the secretary. It's amazing how romantic these Enron guys can be when they realize, 'Hey, wait a minute, wives can't be forced to testify against their husbands.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Skilling said today, 'She was the best secretary Enron ever had. She could shred 950 words a minute.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they're on their honeymoon now. I guess that's going pretty well. I mean, hey, he's used to screwing Enron employees, so really, what's the difference?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story in sports, Tonya Harding has signed a deal to fight Paula Jones in a boxing match on the Fox network. I'm waiting for this one. Is there enough makeup in the world for these two women to be on TV at the same time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what are the vendors going to be like on that fight? 'Get your possum here. Possum on a stick. Yee-haw!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it might be Paula Jones by a nose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barbara Walters criticized ABC's handling of Ted Koppel and said for ABC to treat Ted as dispensable and irrelevant is thoughtless and hurtful. Then she immediately asked for Ted Koppel's parking spot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Enron executives Jeffrey Skilling and Rebecca Carter married each other during a huge ceremony in Houston. These two Enron execs got married. The happy couple is planning to honeymoon for three weeks in front of Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Washington Post, when Stevie Wonder performed in Washington, DC, the other night, President Bush tried waving to him from the audience. That's true. He saw him and he tried to get his attention by waving to him. That's a true story. Apparently, after a moment the President realized his error and whispered, 'I can't believe I did that,' to Marlee Matlin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just 48 hours after he lost his bid for reelection, Gary Condit says he's gonna write a book about the Chandra Levy scandal. I'm not sure what kind of book it will be, I think you can rule out a whodunit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say this could be the first book published without a spine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Enron executive Jeffery Skilling -- you know that guy, yeah, the creepy guy. He and his secretary got married in Houston last week. Pretty lavish wedding. In fact, I hear it cost 18 pension plans and three college funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news, IRS refunds are on the average 12% higher this year, because of the tax cut. That's good. People are getting a bigger refund, but shouldn't we be getting a refund from the shadow government, too? We're paying for both these governments, only one of them is giving us the money back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard about that by now. There is this shadow government. We have a shadow government waiting to take over in case our current government fails.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In international news, after what they say was an exhaustive investigation, the defense minister of France said today that Osama bin Laden is either still in hiding in Afghanistan, he may have escaped to Pakistan, or he may already be dead.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Homeland Security Director, Tom Ridge, says the United States and Mexico will create a fast lane, a fast lane to the Mexican border, to get people through quicker. See, if you have 12 or less in your trunk, you go right through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chinese scientists announced this week they have successfully cloned the first human embryo. See, this will help them with their human rights violations.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Independent Counsel Robert Ray.this is the guy who took over after Ken Starr. Well, Robert Ray, they finally released his final report.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And several suspects in a botched robbery of a Staples store in New York have been identified as airport security workers from Kennedy Airport.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. Senate wants to pass a resolution supporting our troops in Afghanistan, which, everyone thinks is a good idea. But get this.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland security chief Tom Ridge said he is preparing a five-stage color-coded alert system to warn Americans of threats. Actually this is not new.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Down in Guantanamo Bay, military officials down there have met a few more of the prisoner's demands. We've now agreed to give the prisoners reading glasses and hot tea. Reading glasses and hot tea. Who are we holding down there, Angela Lansbury?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, independent counsel Robert Ray -- I don't know if you remember him, he is the guy who took over the investigation after Ken Starr. He released his final report and he concluded, I mentioned this other the night, he concluded in s report that President Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Now he's working on a new report. He says it's still a little early, but he thinks there might be some problems with the books at Enron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In responding to the collapse of Enron, President Bush said it's time for us to crack down on corporate shenanigans. That's what he called it, shenanigans , is what this is. Later, Ken Lay's attorney was able to plea bargain it down to just tomfoolery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, former President Bill Clinton appeared on the game show jeopardy. Isn't that unbelievable? He really was on jeopardy.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Canon Company, you know the folks that make those printers and the copiers -- the Canon copiers?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess the mode we're in right now is yellow, that's what Tom Ridge said, if you look around we are in yellow. And Tom Ridge said today, it will be years before we go back to green. Which is fine for us here in LA. You ever drive out here? Yellow is green. Same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the most recent Democratic poll taken just this week, Al Gore still the number one choice to run for president in the year 2004. But, you know who's second? They said Hillary Clinton is breathing down his neck. And today, Bill said, 'Hey, fine with me, as long as she's not breathing down my neck.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some members of Congress now are complaining that they are underpaid. Congress wants to propose a pay raise for themselves. Well, you can't blame them. You know, a lot of them took a big income hit when that Enron thing folded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Vegas turned them down, Washington, DC has granted Mike Tyson a boxing license. Well, I guess they figure hey, if Washington could give visas to terrorists, we can give Mike Tyson a boxing license, certainly, please.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CBS has announced that they are planning to make a movie about the rise and fall of Enron. Yeah, gonna be on CBS. Experts say the movie will probably get huge ratings because most CBS viewers think Enron is a gentle laxative.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot; match with Tonya Harding, &quot;Paula Jones kept turning away, and getting hit in the back of the head. Same strategy she used with Clinton, remember, back in the hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has warned all Americans to be on high alert for INS workers who are idiots.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know this story? The INS approved the visas of those terrorist hijackers. They died six months ago. They just got their approval this week. And I'll tell you, Attorney General John Ashcroft - furious. He hasn't been this mad since the last time he saw a naked statue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, apparently getting a student visa from the INS is just a little less difficult than being pre-approved for a Discover card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big news, Harding, Tonya Harding won after knocking&quot; Paula Jones &quot;down to the canvas. Knocked her right down. Yeah, and when President Clinton heard about the fight, he said, 'Finally, somebody got Paula Jones to go down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ted Koppel still uncertain about his future. This is the latest on that story.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Ridge announced a new color-coded warning system. A color-coded system to keep the public informed about disasters. Seems like a good idea. Yeah, apparently red is the highest alert and it means Dick Cheney is about to eat a mozzarella stick.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the big story here in Los Angeles continues to be that horrible case of dog mauling. But enough about the Tonya Harding- Paula Jones fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This celebrity boxing is huge. We have one that's coming on tomorrow night. Well, show them who's fighting. Ellen, show that clip. Gary Coleman and Janet Reno!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Paula Jones -- did you see when she was running from Tonya? Did you see when she was running? Man, I don't think she's run that fast since Clinton pulled his pants down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the weigh in, they did not reveal Paula and Tonya's weight, because FOX said it was private and personal. I love this. Tonya cheats at the Olympics, she makes a honeymoon porn video. Paula poses nude in 'Penthouse,' and describes Clinton's sex organ in court, but we don't want to give her weight, that's private.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember that story two days ago about Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie adopting the tiny Cambodian baby? Remember this story? It was in 'People magazine.' I love this story. The adoption has been on hold, because the INS won't give the baby a visa. Yeah. Too bad they didn't name the baby Mohammed Atta. Then he could have slipped right in possibly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush is furious that the INS issued those two terrorists visas. Remember, they were killed in the attack. Their visas just came through this week. The INS said it was an honest mistake. They said they didn't recognize them without the ski mask on. Under occupation, they didn't write terrorist, so how were they to know. I don't mind them issuing visas to dead terrorists, it's the live ones that bother me. And of course, those baby terrorists. Keep them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head of the Transportation Security Administration has announced that airport security screeners will now only frisk people of the same sex. Are you happy with that? I tell you -- I feel a lot better knowing that the worker whose hands are down my pants now is a guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know why they did this? Because every time a guy got patted down by a female security guard, it would slow things up, because he'd get in line again. 'Hey, you missed a spot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lawyer for the American Taliban kid, John Walker Lindh, the little traitor kid there.announced his legal strategy today. Listen to this. This is what they're going to claim. They say, 'John was disillusioned when he learned about the attacks on America. He wanted to quit the Taliban but he couldn't, because he feared for his life.' Stop the voting, okay? I think we have best nominee for best actor, yeah, right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;St. Patrick's day, boy, that's going to throw the government off this year. That's going to throw everything way off. Everybody walking around wearing green. Tom Ridge is going, 'No, yellow. We're still in yellow alert!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arthur Andersen accounting firm has just been indicted over the Enron scandal. Although the Justice Department, having trouble getting them into court. Every time they serve them a subpoena, somebody shreds it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oregon State University now is going to be offering a course this spring called the Enron implosion. And they're going to have various experts come in and discuss the rise and fall of Enron to the students. In fact, it's supposed to be a pretty realistic class. In fact, kids will actually get extra credit for cheating on the exam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, you know we have been joking about the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, apparently, now they have a commercial they have been running. I guess they're a little embarrassed by all the things that are happening. Show the commercial. Take a look. 'Attention terrorists -- are you having a hard time getting into England? How about France? Or even Canada? Tired of being turned down for a visa? Why not try the United States of America, Where our motto is - &quot;No visa, no problem&quot;? We at the INS will help you obtain your very own visa. Guaranteed, no one can be turned down. We have already given out thousands of visas to people who can't get admitted to other countries, terrorists like you. And you. So what are you waiting for? Yes. Whether you're a suicide bomber, a shoe bomber or even the big man himself -- you can't be denied. US visas, everywhere you terrorists want to be.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in the Middle East, Israeli troops tear-gassed Geraldo Rivera. Yeah, as a result, fighting stopped for several hours while both sides laughed hysterically.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What other Oscar gossip? See, the Oscar gossip, it trickles out. It takes a few days. I read in the Washington papers today that when Gwyneth Paltrow walked out on stage at the Oscars, Attorney General John Ashcroft actually drew a bra on his TV set.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard the latest on airport security. Seems that screeners at 32 major airports around the country who were tested failed to detect hundreds of knives, guns and simulated explosives. So apparently, it is safe to fly again, you know, if you're a terrorist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CNN is reporting terrorists might actually be working right now at our nuclear power plants, and now the plants want the government to take over their security. Well, I guess they saw what a great job they were doing at the airports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An 86-year-old ice cream vender, from right here in LA, quit his job, abandoned his ice cream truck on the street, just left it, and returned to Afghanistan where he is now the new governor. So apparently, their standards for politicians are the same as ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The former Mayor of Washington, DC, Marion 'The Bitch Set Me Up' Barry. You know, he was -- he was stopped by the police the other day and they found what they said -- traces of drug residue in his car. And Barry said today, 'That is impossible.' He said, 'I snorted all of it, there is no way -- there is no way there is any residue left.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Playboy magazine is now doing a 'Women of Enron' pictorial spread for an upcoming issue. This is true. They're inviting current and former female employees of Enron to pose naked for the magazine. Apparently, the only thing these women have left to shred is their dignity, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new survey in USA Today, 62% of Americans, 62% think Al Gore looks better without his beard. Yeah. And not only that, 92% of Americans think the beard looks better without Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you have been enjoying the new comedy on CBS, 'Baby Bob,' all about the talking baby? Fantastic. They have a special Passover episode of Baby Bob tonight. In tonight's show, Baby Bob talks his way out of a briss. That's an exciting show. And then next week on Baby Bob, it turns out Baby Bob's DNA matches President Clinton's DNA, and that's a whole different deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, what do we really know about Afghanistan? You see it, they have earthquakes like every day. People with heavy weapons just roam the streets. Everybody speaks a different language. It's like living in LA. Earthquakes, people, guns, it's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here you go, according to a new Gallup poll, 62% of Americans think Al Gore looks better without a beard. Of course, the figures could change, they're still waiting for the results from Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former President Clinton is in London, where he met his daughter Chelsea's new boyfriend. I mean, that's got to be awkward. Isn't it? I mean, it's not like Clinton can even bother to give the standard, 'Look, I want you to keep your hands to yourself.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary Condit has been subpoenaed to testify in the Chandra Levy investigation. He says he is happy to participate. In fact, it's the first invitation he's gotten to anything in almost a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In business news, the CEO of Andersen accounting, they're the ones that did the books at Enron, fabulous job. He resigned this week. He quit. He said he wasn't going to resign until he personally told all his clients, then he realized, 'Hey, we don't have any clients.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Playboy magazine says they want to do a nude photo spread of the women of Enron. We got the Playboy press release today. 'Playboy feels they have a story to tell and they can put a human face on the Enron scandal.' Oh, shut up. The guys who buy Playboy, they're interested in that human face. Really. I'm sure that's what they want to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie 'ET' has been re-released, and a few scenes have been re- shot. I understand, now ET does not have to return home after he gets a letter from immigration renewing his student visa. He's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a newspaper in London that received an email from Osama bin Laden. That's odd, isn't it? You can tell when you have an email from Osama bin Laden, because you turn on the computer, and the voice says, 'You've got jihad.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even up in Chappaqua, President Clinton has been affected by the drought. And earlier today, he was going door to door trying to organize a group shower.&quot;</SPAN></P>

That's what an Ohio congressman said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, in response, the prosecutor said, he's actually right, my testicles can lift thirty times their own weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then on Monday, they have the annual Easter egg hunt on the lawn of the White House, and this year they're doing a little something different. They're hiding the Easter eggs under an unconscious Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are you psyched about the final four? It's great. I love it. There is nothing better than college basketball. I mean, they start out with 65 squads, and now they're down to four. You know, sort of like the Taliban.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happy April Fool's Day everybody. This is, of course, the day we honor all our airport security workers, so happy April Fool's Day, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the White House today, thousands of young children took part in the annual White House Easter egg roll, did you see this? They roll eggs across the grass with a spoon. What, are we Amish now?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, kind of scary moment, one of the kids had to give President Bush the Heimlich maneuver after Bush choked on a chocolate-covered pretzel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we make fun of Bush, but you see, it's nice. I mean, you gotta -- it's nice to have a President who colors eggs instead of trying to fertilize them all of the time. You know what I'm saying?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the number one movie. 30 million bucks, that Jodie Foster film, 'Panic Room.' Which if I'm not mistaken is also the name of Yasser Arafat's headquarters right now, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Arafat on the news trapped in there? Boy, you thought you hated going to the office Monday morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week, an Arab newspaper got an email addressed to the Arab summit in Beirut and they believe it came from Osama bin Laden himself. You know, this guy is sitting in a cave somewhere huddled over camel dung fire -- he's sending off emails. I'm in Beverly Hills, I got to wait two hours to log on to AOL. This is not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh, you remember him? He was in court today complaining about his treatment after he was captured by the Americans. He said he was confined.yeah, that's my feeling exactly. He said he was confined to a tiny room with no heat and one light bulb. Oh, shut up, okay? Hey, to every other 20-year-old in this country that's called a dorm room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a new report, you know musicians in Afghanistan are being allowed to play music again? For the first time since the Taliban dropped. You know the most popular music over there right now? I'm not making this up, disco. Disco music is like the hottest thing in Afghanistan right now. So apparently, what we've done is like a compromise. We took them out of the 13th century, but only brought them up to 1978.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another embarrassing immigration incident. This time authorities in Texas have arrested one of four Pakistanis who were allowed in this country by mistake, they got in here by mistake. Even though they didn't even have visas, they just came in without visas. And of course, all the world leaders now are weighing in on this about our immigration. Like the president of Germany said no one from his country has ever been allowed in the US without a visa. And the President of France said no one from his country has ever been allowed in the US without a visa. And the president of Mexico said, 'What's a visa?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek magazine estimates that President Clinton, former President Clinton, makes between $10 million to $15 million a year in speaking engagements. In fact, that explains why Hillary doesn't speak to him, she can't afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the latest issue of Newsweek, Clinton is on the cover. Former President Clinton says he regrets the last-minute pardon he gave to convicted fugitive financier Marc Rich, remember that whole thing? He says he regrets that, because of the damage it did to his reputation. Hey, let me tell you something, okay, pardoning Marc Rich did not damage Clinton's image, okay? Hitting on Paula Jones, that damaged his reputation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, happy birthday to Al Gore, who turned 54 yesterday on Easter Sunday, happy birthday to former Vice President, Al Gore. And I guess his family, you know, they were hiding the Easter eggs from Al as well as hiding the butter, the cookies, the cake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court of Louisiana has upheld the state's 200-year-old ban on sodomy. A number of Democrats wanted to decriminalize sodomy and they protested the ban, but they did not win. How do you explain that one to the wife? 'Honey I'm going to be late, I got that pro- sodomy rally to go to, yeah. Me and a bunch of the guys are going to be down there trying to overturn that anti-sodomy thing. Don't stay up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had the big annual White House Easter egg hunt on the lawn of the White House earlier today down there in Washington. What an embarrassing, what a black eye -- my God! One of the kids, he's out hunting the Easter eggs and it couldn't be more embarrassing. What he finds is the notes from an Enron meeting with Dick Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's news from Afghanistan. We're still hunting down those Al Qaeda guys, and the US military has captured the Al Qaeda chief recruiter. Isn't that amazing, these guys had a recruiter, the Al Qaeda. But this guy turns out, he was like a genius, he's the guy who came up with the slogan, 'We're Looking For a Few Good Lunatics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton had his dog Buddy, and they were very close friends, and then sadly a couple months ago Buddy died. Bill Clinton got a new dog, he has a brand new dog, and I think what it was is, he just missed getting licked under the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Denver-bound Frontier Airline passenger jet flew through the restricted air space above the White House. Which you are not suppose to do.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm flipping around the satellite channels last night, and I'm watching the Al Jazeera network, you know the Al Jazeera network? They had that new Yasser Arafat sitcom on, 'Grounded for Life.' Did you see it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last report, I guess they said Arafat was holed up in the back room of this compound hiding under a bed. No, I'm sorry, that was Liza Minelli's husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, Israel now has offered to allow Arafat to go into exile, but he's having a hard time finding a place that will take a known terrorist. He can come here. We give terrorists visas all the time. Even dead ones get visas here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems one of Osama bin Laden's top agents has been captured in Pakistan. He's considered bin Laden's number two guy, and the main recruiter in Afghanistan. Which has to be a tough job these days, recruiting guys to fight for Afghanistan. What kind of benefits do you offer the recruits, really? 'Hey, look, forget the 72 virgins, we're prepared to give you 100 virgins, okay? All lookers. Every one of them. 100 virgins. In fact, we'll even throw in a couple of hookers that know what they're doing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lawyers for the American Taliban fighter, that John Walker Lindh guy. They released pictures to the press. You saw each one. The pictures after he was captured and they used blindfolded -- handcuffed strapped to a bed. And the lawyers said it was humiliating. They said they treated him like a common traitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Newsweek cover story this week is Bill Clinton as a private citizen. You probably saw it. President Clinton admits in the article that he's had trouble adjusting to civil life. Civilian life? He had trouble adjusting to married life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see Clinton? He's sitting on a commercial airliner in the middle seat, which is, of course, quite a change for him, 'cause, you know, he's used to flying in Air Force One.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Fortune 500, give me -- this is the new issue. This is the real Fortune 500. You know, the 500 top companies in the world. Enron is still on the list. It actually climbed two places from last year. Isn't that amazing? How could that happen? I realized, 'Of course, Arthur Andersen is still their accountant. That's why.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Walker Lindh testified this week. I guess he's testifying now. And he said that when he was captured by US troops he was locked in a small, unheated room with only one light bulb.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, Dan Rather -- he's a strange guy. This week, Dan Rather, apparently he's been broadcasting the Evening News from Jerusalem.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is good news from Afghanistan, the US has captured Al Qaeda's second in command, this guy is Abu Zubaydah. They captured number two in command.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remember the American Taliban guy, that John Walker, the guy in there northern California fighting with the Taliban?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Clinton, &quot;he had a dog, his dog Buddy, and sadly a couple months ago poor Buddy died and President Clinton has gotten himself a brand new dog.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this week on TV, they keep showing Arafat in his compound there. Just a flashlight under his chin, like they're telling ghost stories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got no working telephones. He's sleeping on the floor. He's eating nothing but potatoes and moldy bread. But see the footage is different then -- like here, that's what we see. When they air that footage in Afghanistan, they air it under the title, 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Israel said today, well, this week actually, that they would let foreign diplomats meet with Yasser Arafat if they only took him out of the country. They let Arafat leave, but only with a one-way ticket. That shows you how serious this is, okay? They're willing to pay for a one-way ticket. You know how much more that is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Fortune 500 came out, list of the 500 richest companies. Enron is still on the Fortune 500. Not only that, it climbed two places from last year. It beat General Electric. It's ahead of General Electric. How does it make the company feel that got passed this year by Enron? 'Oh, we're doing good, not as good as Enron.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Really, that good? They did good? What am I missing here? Aren't they bankrupted? Aren't they going to jail?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this. The IRS now says you can deduct weight loss plans off your taxes. You know about this? This is true. You can write it off, because the government has officially declared obesity a disease. And as a disease, you can deduct medical expenses. See that shows you what a difference an Administration can make. See under Bush, obesity is a disease. Under Clinton, it was just sexy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the current issue of Newsweek magazine, Bill Clinton, this is amazing, makes between $10 million and $15 million a year for speaking engagements. That's what he officially makes. You don't even want to know what he makes under the table. Okay, that's a whole other deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Sunday, former Vice President Al Gore turned 54 years old. Happy birthday to him. Actually, that's not true. I guess they held a recount today, only 53. He can't win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the IRS announced that, this is true, obese Americans are entitled to certain tax breaks. Apparently, under the new rules you are allowed to claim two or more chins as dependents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You probably read this in the newspaper or head it on the news. There was a recent poll about behavior in this country. It's stunning. 79% of the people in the poll thought Americans, you me, all of us, extremely rude. The other 21% told the poll taker to take the clipboard and shove it up his ass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, I think it's true. Americans are rude, and really all you have to do is take a look at the evening news to see how nicely behaved everybody else in the world is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is good news, Louis Farrakhan has announced he is going to the Middle East to try and straighten things out over there. The only surprising thing about this: He did not make the announcement on April Fool's day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some interesting news, more evidence that the ice shelf in the South Pole is breaking up after 50 million years. The ice shelf is breaking up after 50 million years. The Clintons are staying together, but the ice shelf is breaking up. Go figure that out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you remember President Clinton? Remember him? He's no longer President, and that means you can go out and do stuff and boy, is he ever out doing stuff. He goes out and gives lectures, and speeches, and he has important lunches, he has his office uptown on 125th Street doing a lot of paperwork and stuff. People know he's available and a game show producer in Italy contacted him and said we would like you to host a game show in Italy. So, you folks go ahead and make up your own joke using the phrase, 'Come on down.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happened again this week. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from a terminal at O'Hare Airport in Chicago because of a faulty metal detector. It seems that every time somebody went through with a weapon, it accidentally went off.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Federal Government said today they've begun training sessions for airport security workers to provide what they call more customer satisfaction to the traveler. They want to make it easier for us to travel. This is what they're doing. They're instructing security guards to glance at your luggage tags so they can address you by your first name. Isn't that creepy? The guy touching your wife, calling her by her first name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reverend Louis Farrakhan has announced that he is going to the Mideast on a mission of peace. Finally! The voice of reason! If there is one person that can unite people, it is Louis Farrakhan!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has not been a good week for Yasser Arafat. He has not left his office for weeks now. Why do terrorists need an office? A lot of paperwork involved in terrorism?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disco is now the most popular form of music in Afghanistan. So apparently, we may have stopped the bombing too early.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new survey reports that 79% of Americans think that rudeness is a serious national problem. The other 21% told the survey takers to 'screw off.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you knew there was a drought here in New York City? Be very careful. It's been so dry the last couple of months, people are now starting to see mirages, you know, like in the desert, things like hallucinations appear on the horizon. And because of the drought, and it happened to me, I swear...I swear for a second, I thought I saw Mayor Bloomberg, honest to God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rogers &quot;went to the White House and it was very nice. He spent the day at the White House, and he took four new big words to the President, so that was, I think, helpful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's really good news out of Afghanistan. They've captured the second in command of Al Qaeda, this guy, Abu Zubaydah, like, he's like... Yeah, this is excellent news. He was...turns out this guy was the travel agent for Al Qaeda. And they got him. The Pentagon says their next target will be Al Qaeda's party planner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know these dreadful suicide bombings that have been going on? It turns out now that Saddam Hussein is paying these people. He's giving these people money to blow themselves up. Isn't that nuts? Isn't that just bizarre? More bizarre than that, recently he increased their salary. He's giving them a raise. It makes no sense. The increase now for a suicide bomber, the increase in salary is $10,000 to $25,000. That's a pretty good jump, you know? And I was thinking about that. An increase of salary for a suicide mission, coincidentally, that's the deal I signed up with CBS for.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Airlines are in the news again. It seems the five largest pilot unions now have asked President Bush to allow them to be able to carry guns in the cockpits. Why do they even have to ask? All they have to do is put their gun in the carry-on bag, airline security will let them right through. Everybody does it, what's the problem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FAA reported today that four times in the past couple of a months, commercial airliners have crossed over into the no-fly zone, over the White House, you know, where they shoot you down? They've flown over the White house. And they said today as punishment, the pilots will be grounded, but with pay. Isn't that called a vacation?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I guess you heard about Saddam Hussein. This is creepy. In an effort to recruit more suicide bombers, apparently they weren't getting enough at $10,000. Saddam Hussein has raised the amount he'll pay suicide bombers from $10,000 to $25,000. Now what's next? A health care plan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, this is a concept that is so foreign to Americans. How do you recruit terrorists for suicide missions? Do you set up a little cardboard table on career day, they wear a button 'jihad now, ask me how.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Yasser Arafat said today he does not support terrorism, yeah, but he also reminded his suicide bombers to put their time bombs ahead one hour this Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard of the latest thing from [the] Internal Revenue Service? They say you can deduct weight loss plans from your taxes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new issue of 'Newsweek' that just came out, former President Clinton gave an interview, and he finally admitted that he regrets pardoning billionaire Marc Rich because 'it wasn't worth the damage to my reputation.' That's what he said. That's a quote. Clinton said, 'for that kind of damage, I should've at least gotten oral sex.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You spring forward and you fall back. You change it in the spring, you spring forward. In the fall, you fall back. Spring forward, fall back. Same as our Mideast policy. It's the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news. We're continuing to make progress busting up Al Qaeda. The United States forces captured the second in command of Al Qaeda, Abu Zubaydar.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about that Osama bin Laden, is this guy odd? Isn't he just weird? Isn't he just a wild combination of peculiar things this guy?

And I'm thinking 'Whoa, this is bad luck for Osama, because I'm sure he was hoping to have his book selected for Oprah's book club.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we get started, I didn't see the papers. What's our Mid-East policy today? Anybody know? That's what I thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colin Powell said he may meet with Yasser Arafat later this week under the right circumstances, like if Arafat's still alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, Arafat's been holed up in that compound now for the last four weeks. But on the bright side, at least when the cable guy shows up, somebody will be there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More facts coming out on that second American Taliban kid they caught down there. The one that was born down South? He was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. They knew he was from the South because he was the only terrorist with a car bomb on cinder blocks in the front yard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When everyone when else was yelling 'jihad,' he was yelling 'yee-haw.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, after much criticism, the INS is cutting the length of student and tourist visas for foreigners. Tourists visas will now be limited to 30 days and dead terrorists, two weeks. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you heard American Airline's new slogan? 'Fly the friendly streets.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, at LAX, American Airlines 767, huge plane, no passengers on board, rolled off the airport, rolled down the runway, crashed through a chain-link fence out onto the highway. Can you imagine driving down the road and seeing a giant 767 in front of you? People must've been going, 'Oh, my God, that's the new Chevy Suburban.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Mexican Senate has denied President Vincente Fox permission to travel to the US., ironically, making him the only person in Mexico who can't get across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of a first class stamp, rising to 37 cents this June. 37 cents. Let me tell you something, the Post Office, they do a lot of research to determine what number would be most annoying to the American people. See, most people have two quarters or four dimes, nobody has 37 cents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Clinton, God bless him. He shows up more now than when he was in the White House. He was out at a New York bar with several members of the cast of 'The Sopranos.' Having dinner with the members of 'The Sopranos.' Which is great for everybody. They gave him tips on acting and, of course, he gave them tips on being in an organized crime family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much to discuss, going on in the world. President Bush working very hard on the Mideast problem. I think he'll solve it. According to a White House aide, President Bush's speech this week on the Middle East conflict went through 17 different drafts. Yeah, which is actually good, 'cause the first draft started off, 'Dear bad guys.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an announcement here, ladies and gentlemen, about tax time: get ready to pay your income tax or you're going to jail. They are not kidding around. If your accountant is Arthur Andersen, if Arthur Andersen is your accountant, today was the last day you can have your tax document shredded by April 15th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My God, there's a drought. Are you aware there's a drought going on? . Mayor Bloomberg started a brush fire accidentally. He flipped a joint out his window. So that was no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dairy farmers in Oregon have found out now, if they use water beds, their cows will perform better. That's the strategy, they put the cows, the dairy cows on water beds and they are perform better. I said to myself, 'This thing rings a bell because I think...the last time somebody tried this strategy, cows on water beds, I believe it was the Clinton Administration.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Was that unbelievable? An American Airlines jet rolled off the runway at LAX, crashed through a fence, out on to the highway.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived in the Middle East today. He's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon tomorrow and what's left of Yasser Arafat on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ohio Congressman James Traficant has been found guilty on ten counts of bribery and racketeering. A congressman, how shocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten counts, found guilty, and he's still more popular than Gary Condit. That's amazing. Also been found guilty of having the worst hair in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, President Bush came out against human cloning. Hey, if anyone knows how much trouble twins can get into, it's President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that President Bush is getting increasingly frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon because Sharon keeps ignoring him. He's getting very frustrated. In fact, today, to get Sharon's attention the President wore something red with a bare midriff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday President Bush said he wants a ban on human cloning. A ban. Meanwhile, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he wants a ban on creating humans the old-fashioned way. He said it's disgusting and it's got to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Michael Jackson will appear at a fundraiser to help raise money for Democrats. Yeah. In a related story, Tito Jackson is going to appear at a fundraiser to help raise money for Tito Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many used a 1040 form? Do you use that one? A lot of people use that. You know why it's called that? You know why? For every $50, you get to keep $10, you give the government $40.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, this year, the IRS, cracking down hard on major league sports teams and the deductions they take. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service said, as of this past weekend, the Detroit Tigers can no longer deduct bats and gloves as work-related items.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After weeks of pleading from the US, on Saturday, Yasser Arafat finally condemned violence and terrorism in the Middle East. Nothing like having a tank come through your front door to make a guy change his mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an interview, Yasser Arafat's wife, this hypocrite, she lives in Paris by the way. She said she would gladly sacrifice her son for the Palestinian cause -- if she had one. She also said she would gladly become a suicide bomber herself, except she's allergic to dynamite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, is in the Middle East right now trying to stop the fighting. Stop the fighting in the Middle East? We can't even keep the Osbornes from fighting with their neighbors. How are we going to stop the fighting in the Middle East?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says that he wants to teach sexual abstinence in schools. That shows you how different it was when I was in school. When I was kid, teachers didn't have to teach sexual abstinence, the girls taught that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government officials in&quot; a town in the Czech Republic &quot;are refusing to remove Adolf Hitler's name from its list of honorary citizens. Here's my question, okay? What do you have to do to get your name taken off this list? Apparently, Hitler not evil enough to get off this? 'We need a little more proof, apparently.' If you want to see the list, it's currently on display in the town's new Osama bin Laden civic auditorium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a hot new nightclub in LA called Curves. This is a nightclub that caters primarily to plus-size women. This is a place where plus-size women can hang out. Didn't that used to be called the Oval Office?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore gives a big speech down in Florida this weekend where he attacked the Bush Administration's record on the economy, he attacked it on social issues. Then he hinted strongly that he was going to run for president again in 2004. Finally, the kid delivering his pizza said, 'Hey, look, buddy, you gonna pay for this or what?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know this latest thing about Osama bin Laden? Apparently, another video has surfaced. I haven't seen the latest video, but let me guess, he's standing in front of a big rock threatening us? Am I close?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new video of Osama bin Laden has surfaced. Have you seen this one? They show a clip of it on the news.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad news is looks like Osama bin Laden is still alive.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this latest video, Osama bin Laden gloats about the damage he did to the US economy. Let me tell you something, pal, most of that damage was done by Americans at Enron. Yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today President Bush got a tour of the Secret Service center in Beltsville, Maryland, where they train the Secret Service agents, which is fascinating. I always wondered -- how do you train guys to take a bullet for the President? Do they start out with whiffle balls, you know? And then a tennis ball. And then hockey puck. 'All right, give me the buckshot.' And then you work your way up to the bullet. I'm not sure how that works.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is pretty athletic. He did kind of a dangerous maneuver in a car. They took him out on the Secret Service test track. This is true. He got in a Camaro, one of those special Camaros, you know, with the big motor, the big 350. He went full speed, slammed on the brakes, did a 180. President Bush did a 180. You know, just like his Middle East policy. Just turned around, went the other.it was fascinating, fascinating to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;British troops are now fighting in Afghanistan, and I hear the Americans and the British, this is interesting, but they have come up with a secret radio code that the enemy cannot decipher. What they've done is they have Bob Dylan on one end and Ozzy Osbourne on the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Jesse Jackson also involved in a three-car fender bender this weekend. Again, luckily, no one was injured in that crash. Although I understand two of the women in the other car are now pregnant. I know that must have been -- must have hit them pretty hard. Come up from behind -- boom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, this is what the President's been up to. Earlier today President Bush handed out the President's Environmental Youth awards to 30 kids in the White House Rose Garden. Isn't that nice? . Then afterwards Bush asked the kids to help him dig up the roses and look for oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you see Vice President Dick Cheney on the news? He's on crutches. Banged up his Achilles tendon, he's on crutches. Apparently, he hurt it running away from the Enron investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suspected 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui was in court today. Once again, he called for the destruction of America. Then he fired his lawyers, demanded that the court give him new Muslim lawyers, he says it's his right. Apparently he wants to destroy America, but only after our justice system gives him a fair trial, then it's okay after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was a nice touch, though. To celebrate Earth Day in New York City, Mayor Bloomberg went out today and planted some weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The so-called '20th Hijacker,' Zacarias Moussaoui, was in court today. He said he prays for the destruction of America. And today, the INS was so mad, they're now thinking about revoking his student visa. They said, 'That's it. Keep it up, you lose your pilot license, pal. You understand?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He also says he wants to fire his lawyers and represent himself. That's great. So now we can execute a terrorist and a lawyer. Kill two birds with one stone.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a story in the paper today about the man who actually trains the suicide bombers in the Middle East. And he says he does not accept every person who volunteers. Boy, what does that do for your self- esteem?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you go home and tell your parents, 'I didn't get the job?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today at the White House, one of President Bush's closest advisers, this woman, Karen Hughes, very smart woman, she said she resigned. She resigned today. She wants to spend more time with her family. That's what I love about Washington. People always quit their jobs. They always say what? They're going to spend more time with their families. How come they never mention their families when they accept the job? You never hear someone go, 'The only reason I took this stupid job is to get away from that idiot family of mine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday was Earth Day. To help celebrate, President Bush planted some seeds, which is very nice. Let me tell you, that's the difference between Bush and Clinton. Clinton was a much bigger environmentalist. He just didn't plant his seed one day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This past weekend, Bill and Hillary Clinton went shopping in Austin, Texas, at a place called Pots and Plants, where they bought a pair of plastic pink flamingos. That's got to be a nightmare for those people in Chappaqua, New York. You move to an upscale neighborhood, you pay $2 million, $3 million for a house, the people next door are hillbillies from Arkansas with plastic pink flamingos on the front lawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend, Vice President Dick Cheney injured his Achilles tendon and he's now on crutches. Afterwards, Cheney was overheard telling the doctors, 'Wow, I've never been to this part of the hospital before.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday of course was Earth Day, and President Bush was up in the Adirondack Mountains talking about Earth Day and he was showing people how to use and ax. As a matter of fact, it's the same ax he is going to use on Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you hear about this, Vice President Cheney apparently injured his heel. He got a heel injury. They took him to the hospital. This poor guy has no luck, out of habit they gave him a bypass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheney apparently.was injured when he banged his heel against a desk. I believe this is the first thing that's been banged on a desk in the White House since...what is the point?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top 10 Other Ways Dick Cheney Could Have Injured His Foot: 10. His foot had a heart attack. 9. Kicked toaster out of frustration when it wasn't cooking his ham and cheese Hot Pocket quickly enough. 8. Leg wrestling with Condoleeza Rice. 7. Went for a goofy-foot 360 and ate it, dude. 6. Stepped on a pretzel that had been coughed up by the President. 5. Was stung by an Al Qaeda sleeper agent bee. 4. Practicing pop-and-rock routine from 'N Sync video that he bought from television. 3. Robert Blake did it. 2. Still kicking himself for taking the job. 1. Strom Thurmond drove over it with his rascal scooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A gun battle at the Church of the Nativity. That's the very same place visited by the three wise men over 2,000 years ago. That's the last time any wise men was spotted in the area.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here at home, the FBI is warning banks throughout the northeast to be on the look out for possible terrorist attacks. They're warning banks. Here's my question, okay. How does the FBI warn the banks -- you know it's not by phone. Have you ever tried to call your bank?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President Dick Cheney has been on crutches for the last couple of days, because he said he banged his foot on the corner of a table.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what I don't understand about this Administration. It survived massive terrorists attacks. It's fighting a war on a couple of fronts, but somehow, salted pretzels and sharp corners almost bring us to total shut down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, who announced he is getting married. He's coming here next week, which should be fun. Yeah, he announced he's getting married. White House spokesman -- that's a great job to have. You can come home at 4:00 in the morning reeking of alcohol, perfume all over your clothes, your wife says, 'Where have you been?&quot;I'm sorry, I have no comment on that.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech earlier today, and I think this is very big news. President Bush said that the Palestinians should have their own state. That's what he said. Big news. Apparently the Palestinians agreed, and said they'd love their own state as long as it's not New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell turned down an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to get involved in the Mideast peace process.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael Jackson and former President Clinton appeared at the same fundraiser in Harlem. They were both there. And reportedly, Michael Jackson and President Clinton were the only white people there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karen Hughes, the woman who ran George W. Bush's Presidential campaign and has been presidential counselor is stepping down.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard this today and I thought well, this is interesting, it makes you wonder how many places this guy needs, President Clinton.

You know what I mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man who trained suicide bombers -- they actually have someone in the Middle East, this Al-Jazeera or Hamas, whatever they are.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, during a big fundraiser in New York City, Michael Jackson and Bill Clinton appeared on stage together. How about that? Clinton and Jackson. A black guy who thinks he's white and a white guy who thinks he's black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush spent the day today in South Dakota. Traveling around. There was one awkward moment when the President saw Mt. Rushmore and said, 'Hey, it's the guys who are on the money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today that with the help of new data, I guess they've got new data and new instrumentation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is Take our Daughter's to Work Day, how many of you know that? I think it's a good idea, kind of an annual event. It started ten years ago by a quick thinking Ted Kennedy when he was seen leaving his office with an 18-year-old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saudi Prince Abdullah is visiting George W. Bush down in Crawford, Texas, at the ranch, spending the weekend down there. After that like many Saudi Arabians, he'll go to Florida and enroll in a flight school.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I guess everybody knows that Mayor Bloomberg smokes a lot of weed. He said he stopped because something happened earlier this week.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the Vatican is taking a tough new stand right now. Three strikes and you're transferred. So they are really cracking down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, today the Cardinals are back from their big meeting at the Vatican. But you know, I don't think they get -- I don't think they understand the importance. Like today they asked them what they were going to do next. They said, 'We're going to Disneyland.' That seems like the wrong -- the wrong answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And church leaders also reaffirm celibacy for priests. I guess they figure it's been working so well this far --you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I don't know, the church reaffirming celibacy is like Clinton reaffirming monogamy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush met yesterday for five hours with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. And they bonded. They made a personal connection. Five hours they spent together. Prince Abdullah told President Bush he was the first son born into a royal family which means, of course, he will one day be the leader of the country. Bush said, 'That's what happened to me! What are the odds? Me too!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Middle East, still a big standoff in Israel at the Church of the Nativity. The Israeli soldiers have the Palestinians pinned down.

It's a beautiful thing when all the world's religions can get together in one place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the Democrats -- I love this. You know, I love this bipartisan nonsense.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of gloomy stories coming out of the Middle East. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the deal, so often when you have a ruthless dictator like this, Saddam Hussein, it turns out that they're nuts. And he believes, he believes that he's like a playwright, he wrote a big book called Zabiba and the King, and because he's the guy, you know, they turned it into like a Broadway show. Well, it's not a Broadway show because it's in Iraq, but, it's called Zabiba and the King, it's running now, you can go see it. Although I understand attendance is really dropped off since Nathan Lane left.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It's doing great business, and it's so good they are bringing it to Broadway in the fall. It's actually coming to New York City. But they are changing the name.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think he would be good at that? Look, he's got a dysfunctional marriage, his brother is in trouble with the law all the time, he has these affairs. He is a daytime talk show -- his whole life -- he wouldn't need any guests.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tell you one thing -- I'm just glad Clinton wasn't offered a game show. That's the last thing you want to see Clinton is yelling to women, 'Come on down! Come on down! Yessiree, bob!' We don't want that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I mentioned, for the third year in a row.Los Angeles is chosen the smoggiest city in the nation. It is so bad, when Bush was out here last week he choked without a pretzel, just walking around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never heard of a country doing this before. Maybe they have, and I didn't notice it, but Saudi Arabia is now running a TV campaign. They're trying to improve their image. They have a catchy slogan. This is the actual slogan. 'The people of Saudi Arabia: Allies against terrorism.' . In fact, this turned out to be such a good idea, a lot of other countries now running ads to boost their image. For example, like Canada. This is their new slogan, 'Like North Dakota, only without all the glitz.' . This is one of my favorites, Vatican City, this is their slogan - 'hey, we didn't see nothing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was as a joke, but I guess it's true. . Former President Clinton has met with NBC.about getting his own talk show. Isn't that weird? Yeah, apparently each show would involve Clinton inviting two or three women over to talk. 'Hey, baby.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some Arab countries, people are so angry about America's support for Israel, they're attacking McDonald's -- a local McDonald's.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like Bill Clinton now, CBS. You know they have the CBS Early Show right here with Bryant Gumbel. Bryant, something got up his nose and he decided to take a hike. So he's gone...so now CBS is scrambling. . They got to have a guy sitting in there every day, so they've now offered that position to former President Bill Clinton. I want this to happen more than life itself. But you know, it's a tough gig. You know, you've got to get up, like, 3:30, 4:00 to be on the air at 7:00 AM. Every morning and then people have said, 'this that won't a problem for Bill Clinton. He was always an early riser. Just ask the interns.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Kilborn:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Daytime talk show host, Maury Povich, advised Clinton not to take the job. He thinks it would be too embarrassing for him. You know, as opposed to the other things that happened in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Friday, more than a dozen pipe bombs have been found in mailboxes all across the Midwest. And some of the bombs were attached to anti-government notes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Quayle also said that when teenagers see Ozzy Osbourne it sends them the right message about drugs. Think about it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'll tell you something, these jokes may be new to you, but the White House was told about these jokes last July.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the White House admitted that President Bush was warned last summer that Al Qaeda may have been planning hijackings in the US. Of course, now Congress is demanding answers. They want to know, you know, what did George Bush know? And when did Dick Cheney explain it to him?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House keeps saying they went with the best intelligence available. Too bad the voters didn't. But hey, what are you gonna do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FBI Director Robert Mueller, now proposing the formation of a super- squad to fight terror. The super-squad. It sounds like somebody went to see 'Spider-man,' huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more details coming out about former President Jimmy Carter's visit with Fidel Castro. A lot of tough questions are asked about what it's like living in a third-world country. Carter said, 'No, Georgia's beautiful. It's not like that. It's really nice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess Carter went to a baseball game with Castro yesterday. The only awkward part, I guess, Carter and Castro were doing the wave and 30 Cubans tried to ride it to Miami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're learning as early as last August, the CIA warned President Bush CBS was developing a show about a talking baby. Did you hear that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An interesting story about Hillary Clinton, one of our Senators from the state of New York, how many of you remember her by the way? There was talk this week she was going to run for Vice President. ... Now Hillary is very busy denying she wants to be vice president. Doesn't it just make you feel good to have a Clinton denying something again, just fun, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But since Hillary has been our Senator -- listen to this you think you have a stressful job -- since she became a Senator she's gained 30 pounds. Just what Bill needs, more wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, he [Bill Clinton] always keeps in shape by working out on an intern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fox Network has announced that it will launch a news magazine show that will feature Geraldo Rivera. Yeah, apparently, it's all part of Fox's plan to get people to stop watching Fox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you heard there is yet another Osama bin Laden videotape out. You know, this proves this Osama guy, he's really starting to lose it. You know, what kind of idiot puts out a new video the same week as Star Wars?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More problems for President Bush. Yeah, they are now saying -- did you hear about this? They're now saying that President Bush knew as far back as January that 'Ally McBeal' would be canceled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are starting to go after the President about this. Do you think it's fair? Like Senator Joe Lieberman said as far as these hijacking threats were concerned, he said, somebody at the White House should have put two and two together -- put two and two together? That eliminates Bush right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Federal transportation officials announced today plans to set up a toll free phone number that air travelers can call from the plane if they're being hijacked. Is the toll free part really that big of a deal? You know what I'm saying? Are there people being hijacked not calling because, 'I don't want to use my weekend cell phone minutes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some controversy at the Miss Universe pageant. How about this? It seems Miss Lebanon has dropped out because she doesn't want to be in the same room as Miss Israel. And Miss Israel is refusing to wear her sash. But the good news is, they both say the most important thing -- world peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking in Miami today, President Bush said Cuban elections are a fraud and a sham. I bet everybody in Florida had a good laugh over that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hear about this over the weekend? They found another one of those Osama bin Laden videotapes, did you hear about this? The guy is just nuts, so you see Osama bin Laden, and it's all his buddies, it's Osama, Mullah Omar, it's Jengo Fett, its Count Dooku.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, the previous Osama bin Laden videotapes, one time it was him in a cave, there's the surprise, another time it was him like in a restaurant having lunch with his buddies, and this one is even stranger. He's on a boat, Osama bin Laden is on a boat, and you see him on the boat and looks like he's having sex with Tommy Lee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FBI Director Robert Mueller says it's inevitable. Walk-in suicide bombings can happen in any city in the United States, any city -- except LA.because, hey, nobody walks in LA, come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now the government is urging all landlords -- all landlords to be on the alert for terrorists. Landlords, yeah, they're real good. They can't even find the janitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Bush heading to Europe. That's when you know things are bad, when even he's trying to distance himself from the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US News and World Report says that Baylor University in Texas wants to be the new home of the George Bush presidential library. They say they plan to have a complete collection of all the memos and FBI warnings that Bush didn't read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the latest Newsweek right here. 'What Bush Knew' -- and what Bush knew? Well, it's a pretty thin issue, as you can see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A British newspaper says yet another Osama bin Laden video coming out. You know, this one, they say is just old footage from last October or something. Bin Laden's like 'Star Wars' now. First he releases Episode Six. Then you go back, you pick up Episode Two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush says he will not remove the trade embargo against Cuba. Which means no Cuban products will be allowed in the United States unless, of course, they can throw a baseball 98 miles an hour. Then maybe, maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported today, just this morning, that President Bush's nickname for Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of the most powerful people in the world, is 'Pootie-poot.' I swear. That's his nickname. That's his nickname for Vladimir Putin, Pootie-Poot. Yeah, as a result, Putin's nickname for Bush is 'that idiot who calls me Pootie-Poot.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CIA reports that they found a new video of Osama bin Laden, but they're not sure when the video was made. Yeah, apparently, they think the video is kind of old, because Osama is wearing an XFL sweatshirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been reported that Senator -- Senator now -- Hillary Clinton has put on 30 pounds since she joined the Senate. She put on 30 pounds.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is sobering, maybe you heard this. For the past few days, Vice President Cheney has been saying it's not a matter of if, but when, not a matter of if but when that President Bush George W. Bush will choke on another snack food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, is now on a four-day tour of Africa with political activist and U2 lead singer, Bono.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government announced today they're looking for more and more airport security workers. They want security people to come to work the airport.

No chance of anybody lying about their credentials on the Internet, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the government also urging all landlords to be on the alert for terrorists. Oh, yeah, that'll work out great, too.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, New York City magician David Blaine, you hear about this guy -- mounted a 90-foot pole and will stand perfectly still for 36 hours without moving. Apparently, this is some sort of tribute to Al Gore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty interesting and kind of scary. 100,000 angry Germans demonstrating and then, then they did something very unusual. They stayed in Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday in Berlin President Bush stood at the spot where the Berlin Wall went down. And it's interesting, because in the Oval Office frequently he stands in the spot where Monica did the same thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his speech in Germany today, President Bush -- he's in Germany right now. In his speech, he said that Saddam Hussein should be removed from power.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven Cubans who were trying get to the United States were blown off course and ended up in Mexico. They were arrested and sent back to Cuba. 'Cause there is one thing Mexico will not tolerate, it is illegal aliens sneaking into the country!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico is building 100 foot-tall rescue towers along the borders with the United States to help illegal aliens who get lost while trying to cross the border. Is that a big problem? Aliens who can't find their way to America?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big movie over the weekend was 'The Sum of All Fears.' You see that movie? It's about -- it's pretty frightening. It's about a terrorist attack on a Super Bowl, on the Super Bowl game between what is it? I guess the Minnesota Vikings and the San Diego Chargers. And people are thinking, 'Oh, it's scary.' Folks, that would never ever happen. The Vikings and the Chargers in the Super Bowl -- no way!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The movie's about two superpowers, literally on the verge of nuclear annihilation. Or as India and Pakistan call it, Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To give you an idea how serious the talk of war is between India and Pakistan, even the FBI is now aware of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten illegal immigrants from China washed up right here on the beach. Newport, California -- washed up on the beach. This is true. And except for carrying these little plastic bags filled with a couple of cigarettes, they were completely naked. . And California officials, of course, very, very concerned about this. Because as you know, smoking not allowed on the beach in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study by NASA released today says that a 45-minute afternoon nap increases a person's performance by 35% and improves their ability to make decisions by 50%. So the next time you see an airport security guy sleeping at the monitor, he's just improving his on-the-job performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University of Arkansas announced they're going to be offering a course on Bill Clinton's Presidency. In fact, it's the first class where cheating is actually encouraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's going to be every guy's worst nightmare, your daughter comes home. 'Hey, dad, I'm taking Clinton 101. I have a big oral exam at the end of the year.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently al Qaeda, you know, the terrorist network, the bad guys we've been chasing down the last 8 months, they say now there will be more terror attacks. That's right, it's a warning, say say there will be more terror attacks. And I'm wondering, would somebody here like to go tell the FBI?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because it's now summer down there in the White House, President Bush told one of the staff members to go turn on the A.C. and out of habit he electrocuted the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like India and Pakistan are going to go to war, and both of them have nuclear weapons. But they have to launch them with catapults, so I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got to tell you this -- saw a great episode of that show 'Blind Date.' You ever see 'Blind Date?' Yeah, yeah. Well, they fixed up the head of the CIA with the head of the FBI. Apparently, they had never met before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush has given the FBI sweeping new powers. In fact, for the first time ever, they will be allowed now to have surveillance in churches. That's gotta be the priests' worst nightmare, huh?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC News has sent Brian Williams, you know, our anchor in waiting, we call him. He's the anchor in waiting -- to India to cover the tension there between India and Pakistan. Send him to a war zone. Think that may be Tom Brokaw's idea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will come as a relief to all Americans who've been worried about this, thinking our government is not doing enough. Listen to this -- as part of the war on terrorism, the INS has moved to ban part-time Canadian students from studying in the US. Finally, we can stop living in fear of the Canadians roaming around our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to this week's National Enquirer, President Clinton is considering a TV reunion with Monica Lewinsky. They said it'll get huge ratings. The idea is they would both come out, shake hands and then talk. See, apparently they've never met face-to-face, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last weekend, President Bush traveled to the Vatican and had a meeting with the Pope. President Bush met with the Pope. Yeah. Yeah, the one awkward moment was when the President told the Pope, 'You know, when I was in school, my teachers used to make me wear a hat just like yours.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, you know, it's June, and for Al Qaeda that means it's graduation time from flight school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hollywood now is making a movie about the FBI's investigation into Al Qaeda, have you heard about this? It's fascinating. They're making a film about FBI and how they were investigating Al Qaeda. It's entitled, I believe, 'I have no idea what you did last summer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this week, President Bush has been talking about global warming, or as he calls it -- summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's some good news. It seems the government's 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy appears to be working. The bad news is it's the FBI and CIA.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress began investigating these intelligence failures at the FBI and they said today that the hearings will last less than a month and cost $5 million. No, this is what I love about Congress. Terrorists attacked the US. And they investigate for three weeks, spend $5 million. Have sex with an intern, three years, $40 million. Hello!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're calling this whole mess the biggest intelligence failure, well, since Dan Quayle was sworn in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NBC News has sent our anchor in waiting -- that's what we call Brian Williams now -- the anchor in waiting, just watchin' that Tom Brokaw. They sent Brian Williams to India to cover the possible nuclear war there between India and Pakistan. Why did we send Brian Williams to cover the nuclear war? You know, send Geraldo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first case of mad cow disease has been discovered in Israel. Mad cow disease. I hope this doesn't make people over in the Middle East suddenly start acting crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had that big celebration for the Queen's jubilee this weekend for 50 years on the throne. They say the Queen has the highest popularity rating in the country for a non-elected official. You know, kind of like George Bush here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's good news, the CIA announced they plan to cooperate more openly with the FBI. They just haven't told the FBI yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think about it, the FBI and the CIA are very, very, very competitive. In the time of trouble, when there's signs of security problems, both agencies desperately want to be the one to drop the ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't kid yourself, there's a lot of depressing news. The terrorist attacks, of course. Possible war between India and Pakistan. The stock market has gone crazy. Don't you wish you were President Bush, and didn't know about any of this? I mean, honestly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was revealed this week that instead of tracking down the hijackers, the FBI had ten agents working full-time for three months investigating $300 an hour hookers working at a brothel in New Orleans. They're still trying to catch Bill Clinton!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A new study says that snowmobiling at national parks is very stressful on the park animals. Here is my question. Who are these irresponsible people that are renting snowmobiles to these animals in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FBI and the CIA are going to start cooperating. They're going to start working together. And if you don't know difference between the FBI and CIA, here's how it breaks down: The FBI bungles domestic crime. The CIA bungles foreign crime. That's the difference there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, an Ohio senator created a scandal on Capitol Hill when he refused to attend a hearing because one of the Backstreet Boys was testifying. A Backstreet Boy was like testifying on the environment, and this guy refused to go. He thought it was ridiculous. Yeah, and even stranger, the senator was wearing a t-shirt that said &quot;N Sync rules.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to 'U.S. News &amp; World Report,' Attorney General John Ashcroft's new Justice Department -- he's gonna cover up yet another nude statue in the courtyard. .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the congressional hearings on United States security today, one expert said we should have a sanity check -- a sanity check -- for people who want to enter the United States.
