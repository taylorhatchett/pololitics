<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you feel the government running again? The government shutdown officially ended last night. Should we be happy the government is back? I kind of feel like my sister got back together with an abusive boyfriend or something.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still not entirely clear on what happened. As far as I know, President Obama signed a bill to redo the ceiling at the Capitol building and now the zoo is open again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying Donald Trump is going to run for governor of New York. ? It could be a rumor, it could be true. All I know is earlier today Donald Trump demanded to see his own birth certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he will run for governor of New York. He's too busy firing D-list celebrities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States government...shut down, and - oh, yeah, it was the worst two weeks of my life. Not really, no. Everything was fine. I wish they'd just shut down again and go somewhere. Just go somewhere else and leave us alone. Let's make some calls and see if England will take us back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, Joe Biden personally greeted government employees who'd been out of work during the shutdown. Haven't those people suffered enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a speech today, President Obama called for a new era of bipartisan cooperation. ... He said this because Obama likes to start off a speech with a joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, John McCain said the government shutdown was worse than the one in '95. 1795. He was 44 at the time, cleaning a musket for his son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the shutdown debacle, the Tea Party's approval rating is 30%. In other words, it's the first time the Tea Party has ever been supported by a minority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night, the House of Representatives stenographer had an epic meltdown, yelling about the Constitution, Freemasons, and Jesus Christ. So, it sounds like the Republicans have their 2016 presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, are you aware-of-the-fact the United States government is back in business? Congress got together and ended the shutdown. Boy, that was easy. I am really glad the shutdown is over. I'll tell you something, it was very lonely being the only nonessential employee who was working.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honestly, I didn't care. It seemed like everything was fine. And the Republicans are now whining. The Democrats are whining. They're all a bunch of whining babies. The Republicans are saying they got nothing out of the deal. That's not true. The Republicans got eight years of Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kind of a rough day, today. A friend of mine was given six months by his doctor. Not to live, to sign up for Obamacare. Six months.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't quite understand how the whole Obamacare thing works. Like the other day, I got a flu shot. But it was from a drone. It's like they're combining different elements of the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President spoke today about it, regarding the Obamacare website glitches. The President says he's bringing in the best and the brightest to solve the problem. Why didn't we bring in the best and brightest in the first place? This is typical Washington. They only bring in the best and the brightest as a last resort. And you know what's going to happen once they bring in the best and the brightest? More American jobs lost to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President was very blunt this afternoon. He said there's no sugarcoating the problems with the healthcare website. See, that's a mistake. We're Americans. We love sugar coating. If you sugarcoat something, Americans will buy it. The more sugar the better! Sugar is the reason we have Obamacare in the first place. If it wasn't for sugar, we wouldn't need any of this crap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced he would no longer oppose gay marriage. That's right. Chris Christie said, 'How can I oppose anything that brings more cake into New Jersey?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is urging Americans who are having trouble with the Obamacare website to sign up for healthcare by calling a 1-800 number. Yeah. The number is: 1-800-WE-DIDN'T-THINK-THIS-THROUGH.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, apparently the healthcare.gov website has 99 problems, but a glitch is all of them. ? The whole point of websites is to design them so that it is nearly impossible to not sign up for something. Every time I go on Amazon there is a 40% chance I will mistakenly overnight myself six seasons of 'Night Court.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nation, I'm back from my vacation. I had a great time. I spent it screaming obscenities at park rangers. And, of course, the big story while I was gone is the end of the government shutdown. Now, Congress can get back to the important work of government gridlock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Kimmel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's new national healthcare program has been beset by number of problems with the website. There are a lot of reports of error messages and instances of the healthcare.gov website freezing up. ? This is what happens when we don't outsource to India. Things get screwed up. You can wait for them to get the site fixed, or you can enroll in medical school, graduate and then just take care of yourself, which would probably be faster.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice President [Al Gore] is here tonight to talk some sense into us on the subject of climate change. My prediction, he will fail. The problem is?it's not at the top of our priority list. Maybe if climate was spelled with a K, like Kardashian, we'd pay attention. But it isn't, so we don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's see what's going on over in Washington. They're still having a lot of trouble with Obamacare. First, the website is all screwed up. That's got a bunch of glitches. And now people are getting a busy signal when they try to apply over the phone for Obamacare. So you can't use the Internet. And you can't use the phone. And now fax machines are, like, 'Look who's come crawling back to Mr. Fax Machine.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good news, guys. The country's unemployment rate went down to 7.2 percent last month. That's right. It went down after 148,000 jobs were added. Of course, all those people were hired to fix the Obamacare website. But still, a job is a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may have heard about this. A 25-year-old man in New York was arrested for trying to join Al Qaeda. Well, here is the amazing part. He said it was still easier to join Al Qaeda using their website than it was to sign up for Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said yesterday, when it comes to all the problems with the Obamacare website - he said, 'No one is madder than me.' So apparently, he hasn't met any of these Republicans, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course, you know, today...there were more problems with the website. It seems, when you type in your age, it's confusing. Because it's not clear if they want the age you are right now. Or the age you'll be when you finally log in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess they're bringing in a lot of experts. The Obama Administration said today they've asked Verizon to help them fix the website. In fact, Verizon adding a special feature - listen to this - where if you're sick, you will be able to check your life expectancy by how many bars you have left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, here's my favorite part. The President said yesterday that if it was taking too long?you can bypass the website and enroll by mail. See, only the Federal government could come up with a website that's slower than sending something by mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is pretty dramatic. Yesterday at the White House, a young woman standing behind the President nearly passed out while Obama was speaking. Did you see that? Did you see that? Well, the President turned and grabbed her, held her while she got some help. See, that's under the good coverage of Obamacare. See that's?where you're actually being taken care of personally by Obama. See, that's the platinum package. ? If she had just had the bronze package, then Joe Biden would have just given her a Wet-Nap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare having a hard time. Colorado's Obamacare website is trying to sell Obamacare to college kids by calling it 'Bro-surance.' Unfortunately, the website wasn't working today because it was 'bro-broken.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some pundits are comparing President Obama pushing Obamacare to a late-night pitchman on an infomercial. Obama said, 'That's not true, but don't take my word for it. Just ask some of these satisfied customers.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Popularity of Congress at all-time low. According to recent poll - I'm not making this up - Americans like head lice more than they like Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to bring you depressing stories night after night. That's why tonight I am so happy to finally have some good news to report. Millions of Americans can't get health insurance. The Obamacare website is a disaster, and I am loving it! This techno-turd taco will be Barack Obama's true legacy. It's his Gettysburg Address - if Lincoln had said, 'Four score and Error 404, Emancipation not found.'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, I'm not surprised it ain't working. This website relies on separately designed databases and software from 55 different contractors. Getting that many people to work together is like herding cats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is talking about the Obamacare website. Apparently, this thing has got all of these glitches, and now tech experts are saying the only way to fix it is to completely start over and redesign the whole website from scratch. While the guys from the Geek Squad said, 'Did you try blowing on it? Did you turn it off and wait five seconds and plug it back in? Oh, my God. I make $7 an hour, okay? I call myself a geek.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody likes this thing. In fact, only 12 percent of Americans think the roll-out of Obamacare is going well. While 100 percent of Republicans think the roll-out of Obamacare is going great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has fired one of its national security officials for setting up an anonymous Twitter account that was leaking internal information. President Obama called the invasion of privacy unacceptable, while Americans called it karma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the latest on Obama-crash. I mean, Obamacare, the website. The Obama Administration has now asked Verizon to help fix the Obamacare website. Now, Verizon wasn't the President's first choice. He initially reached out to T-Mobile, but they dropped the call. So, then he went to Verizon after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Consumer Reports' is now recommending people sit back and wait a few weeks until the government fixes the problem. Really, a few weeks? When was the last time the government fixed anything in a few weeks? We still have troops in Korea. Okay. Really, a few weeks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US Capitol dome - you know the dome? It's going to undergo extensive repairs. Over 1,000 cracks in it. They're going to spend $59.6 million to fix cracks and other problems on the outside of the Capitol building. Hey, how about we fix the problems inside the capitol building? Start there, and then work your way up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, some good news for President Obama. About time he had good news. Despite all of the website problems, the approval rating for Obamacare has gone up. That's a true fact, yeah. Unfortunately, I can't give you the exact number, because it's listed on the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is weird. Somebody in the White House used a fake Twitter account to send out hundreds of anti-Obama tweets. ... The account was immediately shut down, and Malia has been grounded.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark my words, folks. Next Obama will have the Army Rangers in berets and dress the Navy up in little sailor suits. We're not selling Cracker Jacks here. Oh, and you can forget wearing cameo. Soon our soldiers will all be wearing Georgia O'Keeffe paintings.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are still having trouble signing up for Obamacare because the website is totally screwed up. And the White House isn't happy about it either. Now they're saying that they want the website to be completely fixed by Thanksgiving. Then the tech guy who's trying to fix it said, 'Yeah, well I want a girlfriend, but guess what, ain't happening, buddy.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even with everything going on with Obamacare, the President still has stuff to do. Just yesterday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was in the Oval Office to meet with Obama and Joe Biden. Obama said, 'It's an honor to have you here.' Well, Biden says, 'Hello, I'm not supposed to talk.'&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you know, this Obama-crash - Obamacare website not working out too well. In fact, today, some marketing experts are comparing the roll-out to a Ford Edsel filled with new coke. That's what they said. It's sort of equivalent.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Well, they are making progress. Like they said today, if you find yourself getting too frustrated trying to log on, they've added a link to a suicide hotline. I think that will help.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what the President should do? Put the NSA in charge of the website. That way there's nothing to fill out. They already have all our information.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Saudi Arabia now threatening to sever diplomatic ties with the United States over Syria. Hope that doesn't cause them to do something drastic. You know, like overcharge us for oil.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain now hinting that he may run for reelection to the Senate in 2016 when he is 80-years-old. Hey, why not? I mean, why should he settle for sitting at home playing bingo and shuffleboard when he could be sitting in the Senate playing video poker on his iPhone?&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the world of politics, there's been a lot of speculation but now it's clear that Joe Biden will run for president in 2016. That's true. They're saying he's going to run, yeah. In an effort to appear presidential, today Biden launched a website that doesn't work. That's what president's do.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of the Obamacare website?One of the contractors who built the Obamacare website testified before Congress today. You can tell he built the site because any time they would ask a question, he would freeze.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know Europeans are really angry with us for spying on them. The nerve of those guys. Here's the latest. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the US would have to regain her trust after the NSA eavesdropped on her cell phone. You know things are bad when we're being accused of having boundary issues by Germany.&quot; Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually this is true, German Chancellor Angela Merkel she is angry at the US and this is a quote: 'Spying among friends cannot be.' Then she introduced her chief speech writer, Yoda.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just crazy. Another scandal with the National Security Agency, the NSA. They are at it again. More stuff keeps coming out. You know they have been accused of spying on Americans. Well, it just came out that they actually spied on 35 world leaders. Yeah. It was 34 prime ministers and Oprah.&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some more news out of Washington. All good news, of course. This time it is about the IRS. A new report found that 700 IRS employees owed a combined $5.4 million in back taxes. When IRS workers got the news, they were like, 'Oh, man, I hope I don't find out about this.'&quot; Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My man John McCain was in the news this week. He said that he's seriously thinking about running for a sixth term in 2016. In addition to that, the other thing he's seriously thinking about, stewed prunes.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here is some amazing technology. NASA has successfully tested a broadband communications system that's built into the lunar atmosphere explorer probe. And it's sending data to and from the moon at the rate of 622 megabytes per second. To the moon and back in a second. In a related story, the Obamacare website is still down. Yeah, we can't get that going. But we're getting to the moon and back.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I tried to log on to the Obamacare website today. I don't think I'm doing it right. I lost $300 playing Texas Hold 'em. That's not right.&quot; Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Washington, D.C. police are now investigating a burglary at the home of Secretary of State John Kerry. Somebody broke into his house. I understand Kerry is giving a statement to police right now. He should be finished with his statement by Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a report, more than 700 fake Obamacare websites have been created. Security experts say it's simple to identify the phony websites because they are easy to log on to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House said today that one of the reasons the Obamacare website has had so many problems - it's so popular, it was overwhelmed. Really? How come PSY's 'Gangnam Style' video never had any problems? Really, so Obamacare is more popular than that? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House now says that the website should be functioning smoothly by the end of November. By the end of November. This means, of course, the beginning of April. ... Have you tried to log on? Oh, it's slow. ... It's slower than Chris Christie trying to put on a pair of bicycle shorts. ? It's so slow that by the time it's operational, Al Gore will be complaining about global cooling. ... It has crashed so many times, they renamed it Amtrak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NSA website went offline Friday after suspected hackers broke into it. They got into the NSA website. So NSA, not so much fun when people are sneaking into your computer, is it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Spanish press, the NSA monitored over 60 million Spanish phone calls in one month. And that was just here in LA okay? That's not even counting Spain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of our allies are very upset over this NSA spying scandal. The official word from the White House is that President Obama didn't know the NSA was tapping the phones of 35 world leaders. Obama said he didn't know about this spying, because he is too busy not knowing about the problems with the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meghan McCain says her father; Senator John McCain, is frustrated with the GOP and has not been this depressed since the election of '08. That's 1908, when Howard Taft won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just too mad about Obamacare, folks. You see, the rollout has been one disaster after the next. Actually, you can't even get to the next disaster, you get an error page that says, '404: Disaster not found.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;German Chancellor Angela Merkel is furious the NSA tapped her private cell phone. And yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced that the White House did not use its surveillance of foreign governments for any economic purposes. Or any economic gain. And maybe it should have. We would have learned something about running an economy properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of things going on in this country right now. This is really a time for self-examination for all Americans. We have to learn to examine ourselves. You know why? 'Cause it doesn't look like we'll get any decent healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, despite the fact that for years, President Obama has been saying that no one would lose their healthcare plan, now the White House has admitted, in fact, that many, many people will lose their plans. But there is a way to keep the great coverage you have. Just become a member of Congress. Then the taxpayers pay for the whole thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there was some good news today for the Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. Obamacare will cover all her injuries after the White House throws her under the bus. She's fully covered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not looking good. Remember the old days when President Obama's worst embarrassment was Joe Biden? Remember those days? What happened there? Have you tried to go on the healthcare site? Oh, it is slow. It is so slow, by the time you sign up for Obamacare, you're eligible for Medicare. That's how slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Washington, DC, City Council is holding hearings on decriminalizing marijuana. You thought Washington was slow getting stuff done before. Wait until they legalize marijuana, okay? It will be unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, hackers from Syria targeted President Obama's Twitter and Facebook accounts. Which got even weirder when Obama hired them to fix the Obamacare website.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been five years since America was driven to financial ruin by, well, who can remember? All right. Let's just say it was Obama. ? The point is, it wasn't the banks. Now, a lot of people lost their savings and have had to pay for their retirement with things like reverse mortgages, where in exchange for cash now, Fred Thompson gets your home when you die. And as far as I am aware, he is not legally allowed to kill you to get it sooner. Thank you, Elizabeth Warren. So, times are tough, it is true, but now we have bounced back, if by 'we,' I don't mean you, and generally, I don't. Because since 2009, 95% of income gains have gone to the top one percent. So, that is just wrong. The 1% should get 99%. That adds up to 100. Where is the missing 4%? I bet the poor took it - you know they steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US is denying that we've been spying on our allies. But the Germans aren't buying it. ? They are very angry, the Germans. They're threatening to return David Hasselhoff. You can tell President Obama is getting tired of talking about this scandal. Because today he said, 'Anyone want to talk about my birth certificate?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Ferguson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He [Obama] is also being criticized for the Obamacare website. You know what's wrong with that website? A lot of the people trying to sign up for Obamacare are elderly. So, you've already lost them at 'website.' Here's what I don't understand. Our government is smart enough to spy on us through phones and the Internet. But they can't put up a website? Why don't we take the people who do the spying and put them to work for Obamacare? Bam! Problem solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody tried to sign up for the Obamacare? You guys have any luck signing up? It's impossible. You're supposed to go to a computer and type in all of your information and then?the website shuts down. You can't get Obamacare. ... And everybody's furious. ? Here's why the Republicans are mad. They are upset about Obamacare because something they tried to stop now won't get started.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I like giving you good news, but I'm afraid it's sad to say this Congress right now is the least popular of all time. Just thinking about what's going on on Capitol Hill makes people nauseous. Nausea, by the way, more popular than Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Republicans in Congress are the most-least popular. One reason is that they disappointed their base by voting to raise the debt ceiling on the flimsy excuse of avoiding a galactic economic meltdown. Well, yesterday Senate Republicans did their best to fix that mistake when 27 GOP Senators voted to disapprove of their previous votes to raise the debt ceiling. I believe the motion was titled 'SR-346, Fiscal-I-Call-Backsies.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, folks, it was not easy for them to get this vote. Mitch McConnell had to negotiate with Harry Reid so that the recent debt-ceiling bill included a provision that there would be a second vote expressing approval or disapproval of the first vote. In short, GOP Senators voted for raising the debt ceiling on the stipulation they could vote against having voted for it. Proving that Republicans may not be bipartisan, but they may be bipolar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, there are many consequences to this growing cascade of revelations about our nation's spying activities. Most recently, the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and lederhosen drawers, and the fact that the United States pretended to be her online boyfriend for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are already talking about the next presidential race, which is still a few years away. In fact, a new poll found that 48 percent of New Jersey wants Chris Christie to run for president in 2016. Which isn't surprising, since Christie actually makes up 48 percent of New Jersey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, it's really trick-or-treat time at the White House. President Obama tricked us into thinking we'd be able to afford treatment. You see, it was 'trick or treatment.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now the Federal Trade Commission reports that con-artists are using confusion over Obamacare to sign people up?for what they call fake health insurance. The scammers lure victims with false promises. Stuff like, 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.' See, they'll tell you that. The scammers will tell you that, but you have to be careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, now, a lot of people are accusing the President of being less than truthful. In fact, a couple weeks ago, President Obama called me and told me personally, 'If I like my current job, I can keep my current job.' And I believed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to the L.A. Times, regarding the promises made about Obamacare, some officials privately said...they privately wish they'd had left more wiggle room. Wiggle room. See, only in politics is the truth considered wiggle room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if you saw the hearings today - three different members of Congress compared Obamacare to the Wizard of Oz. Actually, Congress is like the Wizard of Oz. The Republicans have no heart. The Democrats have no courage. And the people who are on the Obamacare website have no brains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this Obamacare website, boy, has been nothing but problems, hasn't it? Oh, my God. You don't know how difficult it is to log on. Today, Edward Snowden said even he couldn't get in. He said, 'That's it, I'm through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is slower than a Thanksgiving dinner at your in-laws house. That's how slow it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is slower than a George Clooney marriage proposal. That's how slow it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, of course, the other big scandal. This NSA spying thing. This is another huge scandal. In fact, today, the White House announced President Obama is changing his slogan from 'Change you can believe in' to 'I know nothing!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President said he didn't know we were spying on our allies, didn't know about the problems with the healthcare website. Have you heard the latest? Now the President claims he doesn't know how 'Breaking Bad' ended.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've recently learned I am a huge fan of Nevada State Assemblyman and extra-in-a-Coen-Brothers movie Jim Wheeler. At a recent Republican Party meeting, Wheeler explained how he had responded to a critic who accused him of being too weak - that if his constituents wanted him to, he would vote for slavery. That's right, when we voters elect someone, we become his master and he must do what we say under the threat of violence. There's only one word for that, democracy. And this promise makes a hell of a bumper sticker, 'Jim Wheeler. You want slaves? You got them!'&quot;</SPAN></P>

In a related story, today workers outside the White House had to sweep up a bunch of dried fruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Authorities in Columbus, Ohio, say they may have encountered their first case of the flesh-eating drug krokodil. Have you heard about this drug? Krokodil? It's made by mixing codeine with oil and gasoline, and it rots your skin. It's a flesh-eating drug. I guess this is for people who feel crystal meth's too hoity-toity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obamacare website is still having problems. They just announced it will not be accessible at night due to maintenance. Also, it will not be accessible during the day due to it sucking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It turns out that Obamacare is surprisingly popular with prostitutes. Which is true. Because it's much cheaper than traditional insurance plans. I guess that explains its new name, 'Ho'bamacare. Just leave your co-pay on the dresser.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretty important week for our pal, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. We love Governor Christie. Well, he's hoping to win re-election tomorrow, and polls show he's winning by a 19-point margin. Christie was really excited to hear that, but only because he thought someone said margarine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Colbert:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, nation, the big news continues to be the slow-motion train wreck that is the rollout of the President's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act ? Everyone is getting screwed by the website, but the true victim of this healthcare disaster are America's most vulnerable - the men. When it comes to medical care, men always get the short end of the long end of the scope. You see, folks, up until now, health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance. Women paid higher premiums than men, and in return, men paid less. The system worked. But now, folks, all that's changing. Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for healthcare, but since women live longer, and have babies, shouldn't they pay more?&quot;</SPAN></P>

I never thought about it while he was mayor because when he was mayor you thought he would never go away, but now he's going away, and I believe - I think we'll all miss Mayor Bloomberg. But he says no, 12 years is plenty. That's three terms and he really now want to settle down and spend more time with his money so that's what he's going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Christie won his second term as New Jersey governor, and in honor of his big win, I promise no more fat jokes about him tonight. But seriously. The margin of victory was so big, even he could walk through it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congratulations to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. He was re-elected. ... Huge margin. Gave a great speech last night. In his speech, he said he learned a lot in the last four years. For example, that lap-band surgery doesn't always work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, he won by such a wide margin, the pundits say this will give him the impetus he needs to run for president. And he's got a new slogan: 'Put the Oval in the Oval Office.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill de Blasio elected mayor of New York City. That was a big one. His first order of business: giant sodas for everybody, yeah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Colorado approved a 25% tax on legal marijuana. Not only do we have high taxes, we have taxes on being high. That hardly seems fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama saw 'Gravity' today. Not the film, his poll numbers, not good. Latest polls show President Obama's approval rating down to 39%.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, have you noticed the President backtracking a little bit on this whole deal? Like at a fund-raiser earlier this week, President Obama said, 'No, no, no.' What he promised was, you could keep your healthcare plan if it hasn't changed since the law has passed. You know, he's such a good speaker, he almost believed it himself. And then his pants caught fire. That's when I knew.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, I don't know if it is an honor. He appeared on the cover of the new 'Time' magazine. This is the headline - it says - 'The Elephant in the Room,' which could be a reference to the fact that he is a Republican and the elephant is their symbol. But let's be honest, it isn't&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Referring to the New York City mayoral election] Yes, 22 percent of registered voters of New York City voted for the mayor. Twenty-two percent. I'll tell you why. It's more fun to vote if your mayor's on crack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new guy, [Bill] de Blasio, he was so tired from celebrating or something he missed an important budget meeting. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Stewart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, all week we have been following Toronto Mayor Rob Ford as he's been filming the footage for what we assume will be his forthcoming VH1 'Behind the Music' episode.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier this week, Joe Biden - what a nice guy - called Boston's Mayor-elect, Marty Walsh, to congratulate him on winning. But it turns out he called the wrong Marty Walsh. He called a dude named Marty Walsh who lives in Boston. But in Biden's defense, it's pretty hard to find a guy in Boston who isn't named Marty Walsh. It's like, 'Hey, you Marty Walsh? I'm Marty Walsh. Yeah, I work with your brother Marty Walsh.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I was thinking about Thanksgiving today, and I realized that's who we should put in charge of the Obamacare website. The Butterball Hotline people. You ever call them? They always pick up. They're friendly. They have all of the information you need. And they're used to dealing with big turkeys. So this thing would be fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House webpage still says - it still says this: 'If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.' Well, we know that's not true. But, the White House said today they're trying to change it, they just can't log on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, people are criticizing the latest issue of 'Time' magazine. ? They got Chris Christie. See the silhouette with the headline: 'The Elephant in the Room.' This is a real issue. No, that's the real issue. You know, people think, 'Oh, it's kind of a jab.' But, in their defense, I think they chose the least offensive title. Here's the other ones they had. Take a look. 'Chris Christie Having a Whale of a Time.' I didn't like that one. Then they have, 'Between a Rock and a Lard Place.' Yeah, that's not good. And 'Hail to the Chef.' Yeah, I don't think any of those?were appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently, there is a huge crack problem in Toronto. Luckily, it's just confined to the Mayor's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I'm sure you've heard by now, the mayor of Toronto, a man named Rob Ford, has admitted to smoking crack cocaine. But, you know, people should have seen it coming. There were signs. Like his last campaign slogan, 'Just say yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Colorado approved a 25 percent tax on recreational marijuana. Twenty-five percent. Now, opponents of this tax say it will make marijuana too expensive. I just hope it doesn't cause people to start buying illegally-grown marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if you watch the show - and I hope you do - you know that we at 'The Report' are laser-focused on the truth. And that means obsessive fact-checking. We check every episode, and if we find a fact, we replace it with the truth. Unfortunately, folks, not all news organizations out there are up to our standards. There is a scandal tearing apart CBS News, home of Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and Julie Chen. You see, two weeks ago, CBS News' the '60 Minutes' took time off from doing in-depth buddy curls with Wolverine to blow the lid off Benghazi-gate. When the attacks in Libya occurred, '60 Minutes' was on the scene within minutes of 13 months later.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama said he is sorry that some Americans have lost their existing health coverage due to Obamacare. You know, I think he's getting a little desperate.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the International Energy Agency, by the year 2015, the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of good political gossip going around. It seems that during his re-election campaign this year, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie paid $46,000 to get advice from a former strategist for Mitt Romney. In fact, the advice he got: 'If you ever want to be President of the United States, don't listen to us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new poll, 26% of Americans would buy marijuana if it was legal in their state. The other 74% will continue to buy it illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Didn't it seem like we just had an election? The election between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama? And didn't it seem like that election lasted about six years? They're already now talking about 2016. They're talking about three years from now, 2016. Listen to this. Democrats, 66% of Democrats, say they'd prefer Hillary Clinton; 34% of Democrats say they'd prefer Joe Biden in a pants suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very interesting fact about the President. It just came out that President Obama brings a portable security tent with him on overseas trips, so he can read classified documents in his hotel room. He sets up a tent in his hotel room. Obama says it's a good way to avoid being spied on while he keeps track of who he's spied on. ? Obama has indoor portable security tent, while Biden keeps it simple and just builds himself a pillow fort.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exciting news in the world of foreign diplomacy. There are signals that the US could be close to an agreement with Iran over nuclear capability. Just in the nick of time. That is wonderful news, because Iran is just a week away from developing a nuclear weapon. They have been for the past 20 years - says people who would like to bomb Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to controversy surrounding Toronto Mayor Rob Ford] &quot;And then after the city council meeting, somehow the story got even crazier. A judge released a 500-page police report. Among the revelations, a member of the Mayor's staff claims he saw him [Ford] on St. Patrick's Day last year with a what he believed to be prostitute, and later that night, a waiter at a local bar said he witnessed the Mayor snorting cocaine. So really, at this point, the only shocking allegation you could make about Mayor Ford is that he was caught eating a salad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Letterman:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody signed up for the Obamacare? ... Oh, my God. President Obama has apologized for the glitches. And I tried to sign up for the Obamacare, and you can play 'Angry Birds,' but I don't remember - that's all you could do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to two international human-rights groups' report on US drone strikes] &quot;I think we've made it clear that these drone attacks are done with surgical precision, because the best way for a surgeon to remove your appendix is by Hellfire missile. We may have vaporized your liver, kidney, and spleen, but your appendix is on the run. Plus, Barack Obama assured when ordering a strike there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured. And that's the kind of almost-sure thing I'm willing to bet somebody else's life on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My man, Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto, he's just out of control, that guy. Seems like a great guy - admitted to buying illegal drugs. He admitted to smoking crack while he was still mayor. And now they're trying to force him to take a leave of absence while they figure this all out. When asked what he would do with his time off, he was like, 'I'll probably smoke crack.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like everyone is still pretty upset about the Obamacare website. It's got all these glitches and nobody is signing up. They're so desperate to turn this thing around that Department of Health and Human Services emailed 275,000 Americans encouraging them to give the Obamacare website another try. Then they said, 'But one at a time.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turns out that a lot of children could lose their dental insurance under Obamacare. That's right. Kids might not be able to go to the dentist. Parents are really upset, while kids are like, 'Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday at the White House, President Obama met with various leaders of the American Indian tribe. He promised them, 'If you like your medicine man, you can keep your medicine man. That's right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like its war again between Bill Clinton and President Obama. ... I'm not sure what's going on there. Bill Clinton said that the President needs to change Obamacare and keep his commitment to the American people. That's how you know you're in trouble, okay? When Bill Clinton is lecturing you about commitment, that's when it gets a little testy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As if the crack-smoking wasn't enough, yesterday a police report came out. It was all manners of allegations, including a prostitute, cocaine, sexual harassment.

She is a former lesbian, although she can be called back to active duty on a moment's notice. And yes, she said that's her former life. She's no longer a lesbian. She even turned in her Subaru Forester. And not to be confused with current Mayor Bloomberg, the outgoing mayor. Not to be confused with him. He's a former leprechaun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is official. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is officially the best. He is the best. This guy is unbelievable. The Mayor of Toronto, now he has admitted that he bought crack. And now he may be forced to take a leave of absence.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After he admitted to buying crack while in office, Rob Ford said yesterday that he sees himself as, quote, 'a positive role model for kids.' ? Critics like, are like, 'How can you be on drugs and inspire kids?' Then the makers of 'Yo Gabba Gabba' said, 'It's actually easier than you think.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, President Obama had a press conference where he said that he fumbled the roll-out of Obamacare. But the good news is, he just got signed to play running back for the Oakland Raiders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare has been nothing but trouble here. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that hackers have attempted more than a dozen cyber attacks on the Obamacare website, but couldn't get in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner said that the Senate's immigration bill is so long that nobody has even read it - that's nice.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, according to a new poll out this week, 52 percent of Americans describe President Obama as not honest. Fifty-two percent believe he's not honest. Do you realize that makes him by far the most honest politician in American history? So, that's pretty impressive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, a lot of Democrats now starting to distance themselves from Obamacare. Earlier this week, Bill Clinton made some critical comments, and today, Harry Reid got a letter from his mortician telling him his coverage had been canceled. No more embalming fluid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, at a press conference earlier today, President Obama talked about HealthCare.gov, and he said buying health insurance is never going to be as easy as buying a song on iTunes. Well, the answer is simple. Fire the website people and hire the people from iTunes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And instead of giving a rebuttal after President Obama's speech, House Speaker John Boehner gave a pre-buttal before the speech. A pre-buttal. Doesn't that sound like a procedure that should be covered under Obamacare?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And Sarah Palin is speaking out about President Obama. ? She said she honestly can't think of one policy that's working. See, I think Sarah Palin is half right.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, President Obama met at the White House with leaders of various American Indian tribes. The President promised to help tackle the challenges facing Native American communities, like card-counting. That's a huge problem. Well, the Native Americans are very upset, because you know, this country used to belong to them. Of course, now it belongs to the Chinese, so they are furious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I don't know if you saw this. Today, President Obama admitted that the healthcare roll-out was a fiasco. He blamed himself and he said, quote, 'I'm not a perfect president.' This explains why Fox News named him their employee of the month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conan O'Brien:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More fun news about Toronto's crack-smoking mayor. ? It just came out that Toronto Mayor Rob Ford spent St. Patrick's Day snorting cocaine with a prostitute. As an Irish person, I'm offended. St. Patrick's Day is for drinking beer with a prostitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama released a new video this week to encourage kids to learn how to write computer codes.

Give it to a friend and they'll enjoy Christmas classics like, 'Hark the herald Kathleen Sebelius sing, glory to Obamacare.' And, 'Obamacare is beginning to look a lot like socialism. Every hospital to which you go.' Plus, 'Feliz death panel. Feliz death panel. Feliz death panel?Obamacare.' And no collection would be complete without, 'Away in a healthcare manager, he said if you like your healthcare plan you could keep it. Obamacare made our little Lord Jesus cry.' And for the kids out there, 'Frosty the Biden.' And the whole family will sing along with, 'O Obamacare.' Act now, and you'll also get 'Jingle Obamacare Dogs.'

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Referring to new budget deal] &quot;We'll pick up where we left off last night with the United States Congress. If you tuned in, you might have seen this - how this, the 113th Congress, is perhaps the worst Congress in the history of not just this nation. So, we thought we would check in on what today's congressional [bleep] was doing. What do they do today? Pass a resolution demanding pre-approval of all presidential handshakes? Refuse to vote on anything, except whether to add cronuts to the congressional brunch. Sitting around saying that Saxby Chambliss is an acceptable name. It's not. It's not okay. It's just not okay. ? Deal? Deal? What type of witchcraft is this? Deal? The elders have spoken of such wonders, but I thought, like the yeti, it belonged to legend. If this be true, it be incredible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been another tough week for President Obama. ? Did you see this? Yesterday at Nelson Mandela's memorial service, two things. One, is he came under fire when he shook hands with Cuba's communist leader Raul Castro. People are like, 'Why would you want to be seen with that guy.' And then Castro was like, 'I didn't, but all of a sudden he was shaking my hand. I didn't know what to do. What was I going to do, say no? He just came up and I shook his hand.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's also facing criticism after he posed for a selfie right in the middle of Mandela's memorial service. ? There he's taking the picture of himself with the prime ministers of England and Denmark. You know it's bad when even Biden was like, 'Man that was dumb. That was real dumb.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Fallon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did you see Michelle while this is happening? Look at this. She did not look happy. Looks like somebody's going to be sleeping by him-selfie for a while. That's what I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like the United States is trying to forge a new relationship with Iran. But the Iranians are leery. They want to make sure Ben Affleck is not involved in any way. 'We got burned by that guy once before.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you seen the picture going around [of] the President taking a selfie with the female Prime Minister of Denmark? Here's the picture. And Michelle doesn't look happy, does she? Look at the President. He's having the time of his life and she is just staring straight ahead. Well, people are now saying it was taken out of context and she's not mad at all. But I don't know. Like, this morning at the White House, Michelle gave the President burnt toast and she said, 'Oh, sorry for the burnt toast. Were you hoping for a little Danish?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Leno:</SPAN></P>
